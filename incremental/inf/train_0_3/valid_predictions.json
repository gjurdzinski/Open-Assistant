White House tried Sunday to win support for President Obama's forthcoming budget, arguing the plan is a balanced approach to economic prosperity and warning Republicans about stonewalling negotiations and pushing a \"rejected\" Romney plan.<\/p><p>\"Right now, the approach of many Republicans, particularly the leadership in the House, is my way or the highway,\" senior White House adviser Dan Pfeiffer told \"Fox News Sunday.\" \"Their view is the only acceptable plan is to try to \u2026 essentially enact the Romney economic plan. The American people rejected that, and Republicans shouldn't be doubling down on it.\"<\/p><p>The White House effort comes three days before Obama releases his 2014 budget, which is expected to include a mix of tax increases and cuts to such entitlements as Social Security and Medicare.<\/p><p>\"You can do both,\" Pfeiffer said on ABC's \"This Week.\" \"That's what you'll see. \u2026 What we won't do is cut our way to prosperity.\"<\/p><p>However, the outline of the plan has already been criticized by Republicans and some of the president's staunchest supporters.<\/p><p>The release of the budget Wednesday, which will be followed by Obama meeting for dinner with Senate Republicans, is just part of a busy week in Washington.<\/p><p>Congress returns from a two-week break with the Senate attempting to reach a bipartisan agreement on immigration-reform legislation, and the leaders of the Democrat-controlled chamber trying to finish a gun-control proposal that might or might not include the contentious universal background checks for buyers.<\/p><p>Pfeiffer told Fox the meeting with Senate Republicans is simply an attempt to find a \"caucus of common sense,\" not end run leaders of the Republican-controlled House.<\/p><p>Last week, House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, said Obama's budget blueprint holds reforms \"hostage\" to tax increases. Organized labor also expressed its disappointment in the plan.<\/p><p>\"The president should drop these misguided cuts in benefits and focus instead on building support in Congress for investing in jobs,\" AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka said.<\/p><p>Obama supporters disagree particularly with the part of his spending plan that calls for a new inflation formula that would reduce the annual cost of living adjustments for a range of government programs, including Social Security and benefits for veterans.<\/p><p>Still, South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham expressed optimism Sunday about the plan, suggesting it was at least a starting point toward an elusive, long-term budget deal between Democrats and Republicans.<\/p><p>\"The president is showing a little bit of leg here,\" Graham said on NBC's \"Meet the Press.\" \"This is somewhat encouraging. We're beginning to set the stage for the grand bargain.\"<\/p><p>Among the highlights of the president's plan is spending cuts and tax increases that would reduce the deficit by $1.8 trillion over 10 years, replacing the $1.2 trillion in automatic spending cuts, known as sequester, over the same period.<\/p><p>The proposal also is expected to include new spending for public works projects, early education and job training, as well as $580 billion in new taxes that Republicans oppose.<\/p><p>Counting reductions and higher taxes that Congress and Obama have approved since 2011, the 2014 budget would contribute $4.3 trillion to total deficit reduction by 2023.<\/p><p>On Saturday, the president said his budget was not his \"ideal plan,\" but it was a compromise that he would be willing to accept.<\/p><p>The House and Senate have already passed their own budget plans. The House plan cuts $5.7 trillion in spending and balances the budget in 10 years while the Senate plan increases taxes by $1 trillion.<\/p><p>The Associated Press contributed to this report.","1":"Though it may feel out of the way \u2014 far, far east on the Lower East Side \u2014 there's no missing American Realness once you get there.

(Sarah Parnass\/The Washington Post)<\/p><p>The House Select Committee on Blumenthal, as some are now calling it, came to order at 10 a.m. Lawmakers didn't finish questioning Hillary Clinton until 11 hours later \u2014 just after the Democratic presidential candidate succumbed to a coughing fit.<\/p><p>In that period of time, the name of Sidney Blumenthal was invoked more than 75 times, and scores of questions were asked about the longtime Clinton friend. By lunchtime, Blumenthal had been invoked 49 times \u2014 exactly the number of mentions of J. Christopher Stevens, the ambassador to Libya whose death in Benghazi is the supposed subject of the congressional probe. The other three Americans slain in Benghazi \u2014 Sean Smith, Glen Doherty, Tyrone Woods \u2014 got seven or eight mentions apiece, then-CIA director David Petraeus and former defense secretary Robert Gates each got two, and then-Defense Secretary Leon Panetta had none.<\/p><p>Dana Milbank writes about political theater in the nation's capital. He joined the Post as a political reporter in 2000.<\/p><p>Chairman Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.), reading from Blumenthal's e-mails to Clinton as if he were the teacher who had intercepted a note passed between two high school kids, said Blumenthal referred to Gates as \"a mean, vicious little\"\u2014 Gowdy paused. \"I'm not going to say the word, but he did.\"<\/p><p>He also quoted Blumenthal referring to then- national security adviser Thomas E. Donilon's \"babbling rhetoric,\" and he said Blumenthal had referred to \"Obama\" (he \"left the 'president' part out\") and \"his political cronies in the White House and Chicago.\"<\/p><p>Clinton refused to get riled. \"I don't know what this line of questioning does to help us get to the bottom of deaths of four Americans,\" she said.<\/p><p>But Gowdy knew. A couple of minutes later, he announced: \"I'll tell you what: If you think you've heard about Sidney Blumenthal so far, wait until the next round.\"<\/p><p>He and his colleagues made good on that statement, posing questions on a Blumenthal visit to Clinton's home, about his work for the Clinton Foundation, his business interests, his attempt to get a job at the State Department and his communication with the former secretary of state over matters as mundane as her new iPad. They were particularly concerned with whether Blumenthal's advice to Clinton on Libya was \"unsolicited.\"<\/p><p>The Blumenthal focus shows that, after 17 months of probing Clinton, the Benghazi committee hasn't come up with much. Blumenthal has been a Clinton hatchet man for years, and he has an unsavory reputation. The very mention of his name (he was prominent during the Monica Lewinsky scandal) lends a whiff of skulduggery to any situation.<\/p><p>But injecting Blumenthal as a central character in the Benghazi probe doesn't help Republicans demonstrate that Clinton did wrong. And the justification for invoking him \u2014 to demonstrate that Clinton had more contact with him than with Stevens \u2014 is a stretch. Whatever else one thinks of the former journalist \u2014 I've clashed with him over the years \u2014 he had nothing to do with what happened in Libya on Sept. 11 and 12, 2012.<\/p><p>Rep. Mike Pompeo (R-Kan.) acted as if he had found a video of Blumenthal attacking the compound himself. Pompeo, who had previously made the false allegation that Clinton got \"most of her intelligence\" on Libya from Blumenthal, asked whether Stevens had Clinton's personal e-mail, her cellphone number, fax or home address or visited her at home. \"Mr. Blumenthal had each of those and did each of those things,\" Pompeo concluded.<\/p><p>Rep. Peter J. Roskam (R-Ill.) thought he saw a smoking gun in an e-mail correspondence from August 2011 in which Blumenthal encouraged Clinton to \"make a public statement before the cameras\" when Libyan leader Moammar Gaddafi was deposed.<\/p><p>\"Two months before the end of the Gaddafi regime and you're already planning on how to make your statement dramatic to maximize political gain,\" Roskam scolded.<\/p><p>Relevance to the Benghazi attack? None.<\/p><p>Gowdy, for his part, found it damning that Clinton aides passed along some of Blumenthal's advice (which he got from a former intelligence official) to people including Stevens. \"It's relevant because our ambassador was asked to read and respond to Sidney Blumenthal's drivel,\" the chairman said, \"in some instances on the very same day he was asking for security.\"<\/p><p>Rep. Adam B. Schiff (Calif.), a Democrat, observed that for all the time the panel has spent on Blumenthal, you'd think \"that he was in Benghazi on the night, manning the barricades.\" During private testimony from Blumenthal, to which he was summoned by federal marshals, Republicans asked more than 160 questions about Blumenthal's associations with Bill and Hillary Clinton but fewer than 20 about the Benghazi attacks.<\/p><p>Schiff and Rep. Elijah E. Cummings (Md.), the ranking Democrat, proposed that Republicans, rather than selectively releasing Blumenthal's e-mails, come clean about their interest in him and make public the entire transcript of his testimony. Gowdy, after a shouting match with Cummings, refused.<\/p><p>Read more from Dana Milbank's archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.","5":"While living in an apartment in Pentagon City, Stephanie Gimenez Stahlberg and her husband, Patrick Stahlberg, a software engineer, began searching for a house where they could raise their family.<\/p><p>With two children \u2014 now 31\/2 and 1 1\/2 \u2014 the Stahlbergs needed more space, including a study area for Stephanie, who is enrolled in a PhD program at the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies.<\/p><p>The house they found in Cherrydale, a neighborhood in North Arlington, met their expectations. Within two days on the market, however, there were 10 offers. \"Our was not the highest,\" Stephanie said. \"We wrote a letter to the owners about why we liked the house.\"<\/p><p>The letter, along with a photograph of the family, worked. What drew the Stahlbergs to the house were the solar panels and the trees and bushes \u2014 raspberries, blueberries, blackberries, strawberries, grapes, apples, plums and currants \u2014 growing organically on the property. The Stahlbergs also envisioned finishing the basement bedroom and bathroom for an au pair.<\/p><p>They also fell in love with the neighborhood. They would be within walking distance to a park and two libraries with story time for children.<\/p><p>\"We were trying to look at homes where we can walk to the Metro, or bike to the city or to the Metro,\" said Stephanie, 27.<\/p><p>Sears and Montgomery Ward kit houses: Cherrydale, once abundant with cherry orchards, is a family neighborhood dating to 1893. While many neighbors have lived in the area for as long as 60 years, newcomers move in and out these days, said Kathryn Holt Springston, who worked for the Smithsonian American History Tours Office as an educational specialist and historian for 28 years. She also served as curator and director of the Arlington Historical Museum and editor of the Cherrydale Citizens' Association newsletter.<\/p><p>Single-family homes, the Arlington public schools, access to bike trails and proximity to the District draw people to the neighborhood. Sometimes, though, they move in but stay only a few years. Finding a house in Cherrydale can involve the competitive process the Stahlbergs experienced.<\/p><p>About half a mile north of the Virginia Square and Ballston Metro stations on the Orange and Silver lines, Cherrydale has a variety of residences ranging from farmhouses to bungalows to Sears and Montgomery Ward kit homes with two to five or bedrooms or sometimes more. Many date from 1900 to 1930, though some of the older houses were purchased to be torn down and replaced with larger homes, including some built as recently as this year.<\/p><p>Living there: Cherrydale lies north of Interstate 66 and south of Lorcom Lane, stretching roughly from Utah Street on the west to the northward-curving interstate on the east. The Maywood neighborhood claims the eastern half of those boundaries north of Lee Highway, lending something of an arrowhead shape to Cherrydale. Since 1908, the Cherrydale Citizens' Association has planned activities and resolved neighborhood concerns. In the 1970s and 1980s, people often referred to the neighborhood as Mayberry, according to Springston, 63. In 1948, her parents bought the house where she lives with her husband and son. It dates to 1890, Springston said.<\/p><p>In the neighborhood, 49 properties sold in the past year, according to Billy Buck, an associate broker at Buck & Associates. The lowest priced was a one-bedroom, one-bath condominium for $200,000; the highest priced was a five-bedroom, five-bath farmhouse at $1.63 million. Twelve properties are on the market now, ranging from a one-bedroom, two-bath condo for $274,900 to a new five-bedroom, five-bath Craftsman house at $1.799 million.<\/p><p>Welcome wagon: The five-points intersection \u2014 Lee Highway, Old Dominion Drive, Quincy Street, Military Road and Quebec Street \u2014 is dotted with at least two car dealerships and other commercial establishments while nearby is a Safeway and the Cherrydale Hardware, which opened in 1938.<\/p><p>The Cherrydale Volunteer Fire House, built in 1919, is home to such events as the annual spaghetti dinner, concerts and for 90 years each December there is a visit from Santa Claus for children under 12. Other community events are the annual Fourth of July party and picnic at 21st and Stafford streets. A neighborhood with its own \"welcome wagon,\" Cherrydale has approximately 1,400 households and three parks as well as the Martha Custis Trail for biking, running and walking.<\/p><p>Schools: Glebe Elementary, Taylor Elementary, Swanson Middle, Kenmore Middle and Washington-Lee High.<\/p><p>Transit: The neighborhood is close to the Virginia Square or Ballston Metro stops on the Orange and Silver lines. Metro and Arlington Transit buses connect at Ballston and Virginia Square. Capital Bikeshare also is available.<\/p><p>Crime: From July 2014 through June 2015, according to Arlington County police, one robbery and two burglaries were reported in the area.<\/p><p>Harriet Edleson is a freelance writer.","6":"MADRID (AP) \u2013 Spain's grinding economic misery will get worse this year despite the country's request for a European financial lifeline of up to $125 billion to save its banks, Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said Sunday.<\/p><p>A day after the country conceded it needed outside help following months of denying it would seek assistance, Rajoy said more Spaniards will lose their jobs in a country where one out of every four are already unemployed.<\/p><p>\"This year is going to be a bad one,\" Rajoy said Sunday in his first comments about the rescue since it was announced the previous evening by his economy minister.<\/p><p>The conservative prime minister added that the economy, stuck in its second recession in three years, will still contract the previously predicted 1.7 percent even with the help. Small businesses and families starving for credit will eventually get relief as the funding props up banks and they increase lending, but Rajoy didn't offer guidance on when.<\/p><p>Spain on Saturday became the fourth \u2014 and largest \u2014 of the 17 countries that use Europe's common currency to request a bailout \u2014 a big blow to a nation that a few years ago took pride as the continent's economic superstar only to see it become the hot spot in the eurozone debt crisis. Its economy is the eurozone's fourth largest after Germany, France and Italy.<\/p><p>Across the country, Spaniards reacted with a mixture of anger and relief to the news. The amount of the rescue fund, if all is tapped, amounts to \u20ac21,000 of new debt for each person in the nation of 47 million where the average annual salary for those with work is about the same amount and the unemployment rate for those under age 25 is 52 percent.<\/p><p>The country is already reeling from deep austerity cuts Rajoy has imposed over the last six months that have raised taxes, made it easier to hire and fire workers, and cut deep into cherished government programs including education and national health care.<\/p><p>\"It's obviously a shame,\" said civil servant Luisa Saraguren, 44, as she strolled on a sunny Sunday morning with her young daughter. \"But this bailout was fully predictable, and the consequences of this help are going to be a lot bigger compared to the cuts we've been living with already.\"<\/p><p>Rajoy took pains to avoid the word bailout Sunday, saying Spain's rescue package is a line of credit that its most troubled banks will be able to tap. The assistance will not come with the outside control over government macroeconomic policy like that imposed Greece, Ireland and Portugal when their public finances were bailed out.<\/p><p>He said interest rates on the loans will be considerably lower than the rate near 7 percent that Spain has been forced to pay recently on the international debt markets, a level that forced the other countries to seek bailouts.<\/p><p>Spain will regain the economic credibility it has lost by shoring up its banks, which will result in credit being restored so businesses and individuals shut off from loans can start borrowing and the economy will grow again, Rajoy insisted, again without saying when.<\/p><p>Europe's widening recession and financial crisis has hurt companies and investors around the world. Providing a financial lifeline to Spanish banks is likely to relieve anxiety on the Spanish economy \u2014 which is five times larger than Greece's \u2014 and on markets concerned about the country's ability to pay its way.<\/p><p>Spain's financial problems are not due to Greek-style government over-spending. The country's banks particularly its savings banks or \"cajas,\" got caught up in the collapse of a real estate bubble in 2008 that got worse over the past four years. However, as Spain's leaders have struggled for a solution to their banking crisis, the country's borrowing costs have soared close to the level that forced the governments of Greece, Portugal and Ireland to seek rescues.<\/p><p>Some of Spain's banks are struggling with by toxic real estate loans and assets amid fears the problem will get worse as more jobless people can't pay their mortgages. The Bank of Spain says the toxic loans and assets total around \u20ac180 billion. Nationalized lender Bankia SA, which has requested \u20ac19 billion in aid, has \u20ac32 billion in toxic assets. Around four other banks serving the domestic market are considered prime candidates for bailouts.<\/p><p>\"I could never get my mind round the scale of consumption in Spain over the past 20 years, having known it in the 1960s when it was still extremely poor,\" said Paul Preston, a history professor and expert on Spain with the London School of Economics. \"Lots of people enjoyed the consumer boom, but not everybody. Now everybody's having to pay for it.\"<\/p><p>Rajoy blamed Spain's woes on the previous Socialist administration of Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero without mentioning him or his government by name. Zapatero was ousted by Rajoy in a landslide last November by voters outraged over the Socialist handling of the economy.<\/p><p>\"Last year Spain's public administration spent \u20ac90 billion more than it took in, this can't be maintained, we can't live like that,\" Rajoy said.<\/p><p>But Socialist Party leader Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba said Rajoy should acknowledge that Spain is now in bailout territory.<\/p><p>\"The government is trying to make us believe that we've won the lottery, that the Three Kings of Orient have arrived, and that isn't so,\" Rubalcaba said.<\/p><p>After his press conference, Rajoy defended his decision to jet off an hour later to Poland to see Spain's famed national football team take on Italy in the Euro 2012 competition. He said he would be on the ground in Gdansk only for the game before flying back to Madrid Sunday night.<\/p><p>\"I'll be there two and a half hours and then I'll leave,\" Rajoy said. \"I think the national team deserves it.\"","7":"Talk to anyone involved in the action-movie glory days of the 1980s and the first thing they'll say is that it's time to bring those days back. \"In today's world. we need heroes,\" Aaron Norris, brother of Chuck and an important behind-the-scenes figure in that heyday, told us when we interviewed him recently. \"Our action movies have gotten too artsy.\"<\/p><p>Artsy sort of left the room this weekend, when Sylvester Stallone's \"The Expendables,\" which assembled a team of muscle-bound mercenaries to fight indisputably evil (but ideologically harmless) enemies in far-off lands, got audiences excited, to<\/p><p>Until this weekend, old-school action movies -- defined, for argument's sake, as films with a slew of explosions, a shortage of moral ambiguity and a triumph of physical effects over digital ones -- had seen better days. It's been nearly two decades since pictures of this sort were produced with any regularity by the studio system, and a lot longer since they were stateside successes. Many of the attempts in recent years have been, at best, mid-budget passion projects with circumscribed audiences (Stallone's own<\/p><p>which topped out at $42 million domestically) or post-modern winks (the French-language \"JCVD\" from 2008, a hostage movie in which Jean-Claude Van Damme plays a version of himself). The few large-scale attempts, like \"The A-Team,\" underperformed. (The biceps-and-bullets remake grossed $77 million domestically, a number that will likely be easily surpassed by \"The Expendables.\")<\/p><p>But the Stallone picture -- with its hard-charging, take-no-prisoners patriotism unbothered by the vagaries of the real world (it takes place in a fictional country, for starters) and its caricature of freedom-hating enemies (\"We will kill this American disease,\" as the TV spot enticed us) -- planted itself squarely in the old-school genre. And this weekend, the movie showed that there's life in that category yet. That \"Scott Pilgrim vs. the World,\" the tongue-in-cheek, pop-culture-referential, decidedly 2010 creation -- the one for, of and by arch fanboys -- trailed well behind \"The Expendables\" only drove home the point more loudly.<\/p><p>On one hand, it's understandable that a movie of easy American heroism (OK, first-world Western heroism) would catch on. In fact, it's surprising it didn't happen sooner. Apple-pie-patriotism already is behind the success of a cable news network and supports large sections of the contemporary country music industry. Why not a film hit too?<\/p><p>But among all the factors to which one might point in explaining the success of \"The Expendables\" -- a cast harvested from so many demographics and eras; a moviegoer backlash to 3-D and CG effects -- it somehow doesn't feel that the demand for neat heroes and villains is one of them.<\/p><p>Norris and his ilk would submit that in our current period of ideological and geopolitical upheaval, in a time of blurry lines between enemies and friends in places such as Afghanistan and Iraq, that black-and-white heroes slake a patriotic thirst (and that, indeed, the movie-going world can support a lot more of them). But history argues the opposite: Those movies succeed when the culture at large is filled with clear-cut distinctions. On the other hand, when the zeitgeist is more cloudy, an entirely different kind of cinema prospers.<\/p><p>The post-WWII era and its mainly straightforward distinctions between good and evil, to take an example of the former, yielded a flowering subgenre of movies with morally uncomplicated gunslingers. And 30 years later, the ideological simplicity of the Cold War and its larger-than-life Evil Empire gave rise to the very action movies on which \"Expendables\" is modeled (not to mention the ultimate in us-versus-them confections, \"Rocky IV.\" Yes, there's a Stallone-ishness to all of this). There are plenty of reasons why these types of movies faded from view in the 1990s, but the fall of the Berlin Wall and the the Soviet Union certainly played a part.<\/p><p>The examples are just as abundant on the other side. The ambiguities of the Vietnam War and the counterculture in the late 1960s and early 1970s undoubtedly offered up the moral murkiness of<\/p><p>\"Midnight Cowboy\" and scores of others. In the post-9\/11 world, meanwhile, movies like<\/p><p>-- with its themes of a destruction-bent enemy that can't be bargained with, and the question of what constitutes an acceptable ethical compromise in fighting that enemy -- have captured our imagination. You can throw<\/p><p>in there too, to the degree the movie was a contemplation of Western interests in the Middle East.<\/p><p>Political eras are, of course, rarely just one thing or another, and the movies we want to see in a given period are hardly monolithic. But as tempting as it is to infer that the success of \"The Expendables\" shows a deeper cultural need, it may well be the wrong inference. When times are confusing, we want movies to reflect that confusion, and even to make sense of it. But we probably don't want to pretend that confusion doesn't exist.<\/p><p>Photo: A scene from \"The Expendables.\" Credit: Lionsgate<\/p><p>Stallone: I'm contemplating an \"Expendables\" sequel<\/p><p>Hollywood wonders if Schwarzenegger will be back","8":"By DEXTER FORDMAY 9, 2014<\/p><p>MALIBU, CALIF. \u2014 Good luck, America, with your efforts to pigeonhole the BMW i8.<\/p><p>The car is a post-petroleum brand statement.

Ms. Temple said the longer Mr. Akin waited, the more difficult it would get.<\/p><p>The first deadline for Mr. Akin to have easily withdrawn from the race was Tuesday evening. His decision to stay in the race means that he now has only a few weeks to reconsider before things get even harder.<\/p><p>Certification of the presidential ballots in Missouri will be no later than Sept. 17, and could be shortly after President Obama officially accepts the Democratic nomination on Sept. 5.<\/p><p>Once the ballots are printed, any candidate who seeks to withdraw must pay for the reprinting of new ballots. That could be prohibitively expensive for Mr. Akin, but presumably the Republican Party \u2014 which badly wants him to withdraw \u2014 would cover the cost.<\/p><p>Military overseas ballots begin shipping out Sept. 22. That might be the first firm deadline. But the drop-dead deadline is Sept. 25, when general absentee ballots are sent out.<\/p><p>Mel Carnahan, the former Missouri governor and Ms. Carnahan's father, died on Oct. 16, 2000, during his campaign for the Senate against the Republican incumbent, John Ashcroft.

(His widow, Jean, was appointed to the seat, and lost it in special election in 2002.)<\/p><p>Assuming that Mr. Akin bows to pressure from Republican leaders (or simply concludes that he isn't able to raise enough money to mount a credible campaign), Missouri law requires that he seek a court order allowing him to drop out of the race.<\/p><p>State officials say that issuing such court orders is routine. Mr. Akin would merely have to file the necessary papers with the court and his name would no longer be printed on the November ballot. Republicans could then quickly nominate someone else to run against Senator Claire McCaskill, the Democratic incumbent.<\/p><p>Democrats would no doubt like to see Mr. Akin \u2014 now politically weakened by his comments on rape and pregnancy \u2014 stay in the race. In theory, the Democratic officials who run the state's election offices could object to Mr. Akin's request for a court order, a move that would force a hearing before a judge.<\/p><p>The relevant statute says someone like Mr. Akin can withdraw \"pursuant to a court order, which, except for good cause shown by the election authority in opposition thereto, shall be freely given upon application by the candidate to the circuit court in the county of such candidate's residence.\"<\/p><p>Election officials say they can find no precedent at all for such an objection in the state's history. But Ms. Carnahan is herself a factor in Republican minds. As the Democratic Senate nominee in 2010, she lost to Representative Roy Blunt, and Republicans imagine she could put up a fight.<\/p><p>\"The secretary's job is to protect the rights of Missouri voters,\" Ms. Temple said when asked whether Ms. Carnahan would fight a court order to remove Mr. Akin's name from the ballot.<\/p><p>A further complication: Under state law, any election authority in Missouri can oppose a withdrawal order, down to the county and city level, and there are Democrats aplenty in Missouri.

Tight end Vernon Davis? He has eight targets in the past three games.<\/p><p>It's hard to argue with Kaepernick's pecking order, given the results.<\/p><p>In a 41-34 win over the Patriots on Sunday, Crabtree (7 catches, 107 yards, 2 TDs) was featured on the 49ers' first possession - a tone-setting 63-yard touchdown march - with drive-opening catches of 11 and 13 yards. Kaepernick also threw his final pass to Crabtree, a 38-yard game-winner on a play that wasn't designed for San Francisco's No. 1 wide receiver.<\/p><p>In his past three games, Crabtree has 23 catches for 301 yards and two touchdowns with 90-plus receiving yards in each game. Prior to his streak, he had 90-plus receiving yards in five of the first 53 games of his four-year career.<\/p><p>In his five starts, Kaepernick has a 113.6 rating when targeting Crabtree, who has helped earn his confidence with reliable hands. According to Pro Football Focus, Crabtree has three drops in Kaepernick's starts, an impressive figure given the heat the Howitzer-armed quarterback puts on his throws.<\/p><p>On KNBR Tuesday, Harbaugh, who famously declared in the offseason Crabtree had the best hands he'd ever seen, crowed a bit when asked if there was a special Kaepernick-Crabtree chemistry.<\/p><p>\"Yeah, I think there is,\" Harbaugh said. \"But Michael has been doing this all year now. Talked about it every week, the ability to catch, nobody catches the ball better than Michael Crabtree. I think back to last summer when we were talking about the same topic. It might have even been on this show. A lot of people 'What? The greatest hands you've ever seen?' Nobody mentions that any more. Boy, the evidence sure is there.\"<\/p><p>With at least 10 catches and 132 yards over the final two regular-season games, Crabtree (73 catches, 868 yards) would become the 49ers' first 1,000-yard receiver since Terrell Owens in 2003 and will have the most receptions since Owens hauled in 100 in 2002.<\/p><p>Davis, who had team-highs in targets (eight), receptions (six) and yards (83) in Kaepernick's first start against Chicago last month, has since become an afterthought. He had one catch for 10 yards against the Patriots, and four catches, 29 yards and nine targets over the last four games.<\/p><p>Davis said he's yet to establish a chemistry with Kaepernick that matches the connection he had with former starter Alex Smith.<\/p><p>\"You have to develop that chemistry, that bond so you can be on the same page,\" Davis said. \"That's something me and Kaep don't have right now. We don't have it. You have to expect it because he just stepped in. Me and Alex, we've been here.\"<\/p><p>Asked why Crabtree has been quick to get on the same page, Davis said the red-hot wide receiver has been running shorter routes. However, he also noted, as Kaepernick did Sunday night, that Crabtree has earned his targets by breaking free from coverage.<\/p><p>\"Crab is a pretty good route runner,\" Davis said. \"He's getting open and Kaep is finding him.\"<\/p><p>Eric Branch is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.

Dotted with pictures of scantily clad women, the website, BigBabyKenny, advises would-be Johns on the art of negotiating with prostitutes. \"Start with a compliment,\" Ng advises.<\/p><p>Needless to say, Ng's website is causing headaches for Northridge administrators. First publicized by the Los Angeles Daily News, the economics professor's site has drawn a wave of unwelcome attention, forcing administrators to at once criticize its content and defend Ng's right to publish freely on his own time without university resources.<\/p><p>\"Until we find representative evidence that it infringes upon the work he does at the university itself, there's not much we can do about it,\" said Harold Hellenbrand, Northridge's provost.<\/p><p>There may be subtlety in Hellenbrand's words, but his message is clear: If BigBabyKenny infringes on Ng's ability to effectively do his job, then Northridge's position will change. Ng has already said his site is run through a separate server not connected to the university, but Northridge officials might still make a case that the site has interfered with his job. Asked if students complaining that they were no longer comfortable in Ng's class would compel Northridge to demand the site be taken down, Hellenbrand said \"I'm not inviting complaints, but you just hit on the key issue.\"<\/p><p>\"If [running the site is] what he wants to do, and at the same time he wants to educate students and students flock away, then that would create a problem,\" Hellenbrand said.<\/p><p>How Ng came to be identified as the author of BigBabyKenny is a story in itself. A frequent tourist of Thailand, Ng took to blogging on the website of a Bangkok bar called Big Mango Bar. In one controversial post, Ng advised men to seek women near a particular Buddhist shrine.<\/p><p>\"The naysayers will say its creepy to be hanging around the Muariti Shrine, hitting on the emotionally vulnerable girls desperately praying and paying Buddha for a better love life but I beg to differ. Buddha works in mysterious ways,\" he wrote.<\/p><p>Perturbed by the post, the bar owners removed it. That led Ng to start his own site, prompting what Ng describes as a concerted effort by the owners to publicize his penchant for writing about prostitutes. They sent mass e-mails to faculty listed in Northridge's directory, and also posted on RateMyProfessor.com, warning students about Ng, he said.<\/p><p>Ng readily defends the content of his site and says he has no intention of taking it down.<\/p><p>\"The university has no stake in this one way or the other, and besides, professors can say whatever they want,\" said Ng, a tenured associate professor of economics.<\/p><p>Some question whether Ng has crossed a gray legal line, however, by advising men on sex tourism. Patrick Trueman, a former U.S. justice department official, notes that there are several federal statutes that could come into play. Within U.S. Code 18 are two sections \u2013 2422 (a) and 2422 (b) \u2013 that specifically prohibit anyone from \"enticing or coercing a person\" to travel internationally in pursuit of prostitutes. Moreover, one section specifically prohibits the use of the Internet to lure people.<\/p><p>While prostitution may be tolerated in Thailand, that's immaterial under the federal code, Trueman said.<\/p><p>\"Inducing and enticing? Isn't that what this guy's doing?\" said Trueman, former chief of the Justice Department's Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section in the Criminal Division.<\/p><p>Trueman, now a lawyer specializing in sex trafficking and child abuse cases, said there would likely be debate about whether talking about procuring prostitutes online and actually arranging prostitutes for a person should be treated differently under the law.<\/p><p>\"Given how lax the fed government is on these crimes, they may not charge somebody unless they are more directly involved,\" he said. \"That's not to say this person couldn't be charged, and as I read it they could be charged.\"<\/p><p>Beyond the legal implications, critics have already attacked Ng on moral grounds. John Foubert, an Oklahoma State University professor who researches sex trafficking, argues that women \u2013 often minors \u2013 are forced into the sex tourism industry and often have trouble escaping it. Even if Ng is operating within the bounds of the law, Northridge officials have an ethical problem they've yet to face, Foubert said.<\/p><p>\"Do they want to live with the blood on their hands of these girls that are being essentially raped by these men, who are going down and purchasing sex? I think that's a larger question,\" said Foubert, an associate professor of college student development.<\/p><p>Ng said he allows anything to be written on his site, so long as it doesn't involve pedophilia or underage sex. He does, however, write about how difficult it is to effectively negotiate with a \"half or sometimes fully naked teenage girl\" when she's \"expertly gyrating\" on a man's lap.<\/p><p>While his critics have been speaking out since fall, Ng said he has yet to hear from a student who expressed discomfort about his website.<\/p><p>\"The job of the university is to expose students to the world \u2013 not just a politically correct view of the world and not just the good parts of the world,\" he said. \"If a student reads that [site], I personally think it's good for them. They learn about something out there; maybe they disapprove of it and they don't think it's good.\"<\/p><p>You share in the USA TODAY community, so please keep your comments smart and civil.

It's been nearly two decades since pictures of this sort were produced with any regularity by the studio system, and a lot longer since they were stateside successes. Many of the attempts in recent years have been, at best, mid-budget passion projects with circumscribed audiences (Stallone's own<\/p><p>which topped out at $42 million domestically) or post-modern winks (the French-language \"JCVD\" from 2008, a hostage movie in which Jean-Claude Van Damme plays a version of himself). The few large-scale attempts, like \"The A-Team,\" underperformed. (The biceps-and-bullets remake grossed $77 million domestically, a number that will likely be easily surpassed by \"The Expendables.\")<\/p><p>But the Stallone picture -- with its hard-charging, take-no-prisoners patriotism unbothered by the vagaries of the real world (it takes place in a fictional country, for starters) and its caricature of freedom-hating enemies (\"We will kill this American disease,\" as the TV spot enticed us) -- planted itself squarely in the old-school genre. And this weekend, the movie showed that there's life in that category yet. That \"Scott Pilgrim vs. the World,\" the tongue-in-cheek, pop-culture-referential, decidedly 2010 creation -- the one for, of and by arch fanboys -- trailed well behind \"The Expendables\" only drove home the point more loudly.<\/p><p>On one hand, it's understandable that a movie of easy American heroism (OK, first-world Western heroism) would catch on. In fact, it's surprising it didn't happen sooner. Apple-pie-patriotism already is behind the success of a cable news network and supports large sections of the contemporary country music industry. Why not a film hit too?<\/p><p>But among all the factors to which one might point in explaining the success of \"The Expendables\" -- a cast harvested from so many demographics and eras; a moviegoer backlash to 3-D and CG effects -- it somehow doesn't feel that the demand for neat heroes and villains is one of them.<\/p><p>Norris and his ilk would submit that in our current period of ideological and geopolitical upheaval, in a time of blurry lines between enemies and friends in places such as Afghanistan and Iraq, that black-and-white heroes slake a patriotic thirst (and that, indeed, the movie-going world can support a lot more of them). But history argues the opposite: Those movies succeed when the culture at large is filled with clear-cut distinctions. On the other hand, when the zeitgeist is more cloudy, an entirely different kind of cinema prospers.<\/p><p>The post-WWII era and its mainly straightforward distinctions between good and evil, to take an example of the former, yielded a flowering subgenre of movies with morally uncomplicated gunslingers. And 30 years later, the ideological simplicity of the Cold War and its larger-than-life Evil Empire gave rise to the very action movies on which \"Expendables\" is modeled (not to mention the ultimate in us-versus-them confections, \"Rocky IV.\" Yes, there's a Stallone-ishness to all of this). There are plenty of reasons why these types of movies faded from view in the 1990s, but the fall of the Berlin Wall and the the Soviet Union certainly played a part.<\/p><p>The examples are just as abundant on the other side. The ambiguities of the Vietnam War and the counterculture in the late 1960s and early 1970s undoubtedly offered up the moral murkiness of<\/p><p>\"Midnight Cowboy\" and scores of others. In the post-9\/11 world, meanwhile, movies like<\/p><p>-- with its themes of a destruction-bent enemy that can't be bargained with, and the question of what constitutes an acceptable ethical compromise in fighting that enemy -- have captured our imagination. You can throw<\/p><p>in there too, to the degree the movie was a contemplation of Western interests in the Middle East.<\/p><p>Political eras are, of course, rarely just one thing or another, and the movies we want to see in a given period are hardly monolithic. But as tempting as it is to infer that the success of \"The Expendables\" shows a deeper cultural need, it may well be the wrong inference. When times are confusing, we want movies to reflect that confusion, and even to make sense of it. But we probably don't want to pretend that confusion doesn't exist.<\/p><p>Photo: A scene from \"The Expendables.\" Credit: Lionsgate<\/p><p>Stallone: I'm contemplating an \"Expendables\" sequel<\/p><p>Hollywood wonders if Schwarzenegger will be back","18":"WASHINGTON \u2014 President Obama is pressing United Nations nuclear inspectors to release classified intelligence information showing that Iran is designing and experimenting with nuclear weapons technology. The president's push is part of a larger American effort to further isolate and increase pressure on Iran after accusing it of a plot to assassinate Saudi Arabia's ambassador to the United States.<\/p><p>If the United Nations' watchdog group agrees to publicize the evidence, including new data from recent months, it would almost certainly revive a debate that has been dormant during the Arab Spring about how aggressively the United States and its allies, including Israel, should move to halt Iran's suspected weapons program.<\/p><p>Over the longer term, several senior Obama administration officials said in interviews, they are mulling a ban on financial transactions with Iran's central bank \u2014 a move that has been opposed by China and other Asian nations. Also being considered is an expansion of the ban on the purchase of petroleum products sold by companies controlled by the country's elite military force, the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps.<\/p><p>The Revolutionary Guards are also believed to oversee the military side of the nuclear program, and they are the parent of the Quds Force, which Washington has accused of directing the assassination plot.<\/p><p>The proposed sanctions come as administration officials confront skepticism around the world about their allegations that Iran was behind the plot and limited options about what they can do \u2014 as well as growing pressure from Republicans and some Democrats in Congress to take tougher action against Iran, with the central bank and the oil industry high on lawmakers' lists.<\/p><p>All of the proposed sanctions carry with them considerable political and economic risks. Yukiya Amano, the cautious director general of the United Nations group, the International Atomic Energy Agency, talked publicly in September about publishing some of the most delicate data suggesting Iran worked on nuclear triggers and warheads. But officials who have spoken with him say he is concerned that his inspectors could be ejected from Iran, shutting the best, though narrow, window into its nuclear activities.<\/p><p>Similarly, China and Russia, among other major Iranian trading partners, have resisted further oil and financial sanctions, saying the goal of isolating Iran is a poor strategy. Even inside the Obama administration, some officials say they fear any crackdown on Iranian oil exports could drive up oil prices when the United States and European economies are weak. As one senior official put it, \"You don't want to tip the U.S. into a downturn just to punish the Iranians.\"<\/p><p>Senior administration officials, who would not speak publicly about internal negotiations over the sanctions, say no recommendation on acting against the central bank has gone to Mr. Obama, who vowed last week to make sure Iran would face the \"toughest sanctions\" for what he said was its role in the sensational scheme to hire a Mexican drug cartel to kill the Saudi envoy.<\/p><p>The decision to press the International Atomic Energy Agency was brewing even before the plot against the Saudi ambassador was discovered, but that discovery prompted the White House to pursue a full-court, public press of the agency to release the sensitive intelligence.<\/p><p>Officials familiar with the evidence say it creates extraordinarily uncomfortable questions for the Iranians to answer, but does not definitively point to the construction of a weapon. Instead, it details work on individual technologies essential for designing and detonating a nuclear device, including how to turn uranium into bomb fuel, how to cast conventional explosives in a shape that can set off a nuclear blast, and how to make detonators, generate neutrons to spur a chain reaction, measure detonation waves and make nose cones for missiles.<\/p><p>Tommy Vietor, the spokesman for the National Security Council, said Saturday that \"the United States believes that a comprehensive assessment would be invaluable for the international community in its consideration of Iran's nuclear program and what to do about it.\" Iran has declared that all of the documents suggesting work on how to create a weapon that could fit atop an Iranian missile are \"fabrications\" intended to justify an attack. The country has been the target of covert attacks, including the assassinations of some nuclear scientists and a computer worm that disabled some of Iran's nuclear centrifuges.<\/p><p>The Obama administration, since coming to office, has never publicly presented detailed evidence to back up its claim that Iran is driving toward a weapon or creating the technology to assemble one quickly, should it need it. But it has discussed the evidence widely with allies.<\/p><p>In part the administration has hesitated to discuss the evidence because, after the failure to find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq in 2003, any American evidence is considered suspect. Widespread questions about the plot against the Saudis last week underscored how deep those suspicions run.<\/p><p>But Iran is a different kind of case. Inspectors visit regularly, measuring Iran's output of uranium, including recent production of the material, enriched to 20 percent purity, that takes it far closer to the kind of fuel needed for a weapon. Iran said recently that it would produce more of the 20 percent enriched material than it needs for a small medical research reactor, which prompted new concerns that it is building a stockpile that could be converted to weapons use.","19":"MADRID (AP) \u2013 Spain's grinding economic misery will get worse this year despite the country's request for a European financial lifeline of up to $125 billion to save its banks, Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said Sunday.<\/p><p>A day after the country conceded it needed outside help following months of denying it would seek assistance, Rajoy said more Spaniards will lose their jobs in a country where one out of every four are already unemployed.<\/p><p>\"This year is going to be a bad one,\" Rajoy said Sunday in his first comments about the rescue since it was announced the previous evening by his economy minister.<\/p><p>The conservative prime minister added that the economy, stuck in its second recession in three years, will still contract the previously predicted 1.7 percent even with the help. Small businesses and families starving for credit will eventually get relief as the funding props up banks and they increase lending, but Rajoy didn't offer guidance on when.<\/p><p>Spain on Saturday became the fourth \u2014 and largest \u2014 of the 17 countries that use Europe's common currency to request a bailout \u2014 a big blow to a nation that a few years ago took pride as the continent's economic superstar only to see it become the hot spot in the eurozone debt crisis. Its economy is the eurozone's fourth largest after Germany, France and Italy.<\/p><p>Across the country, Spaniards reacted with a mixture of anger and relief to the news. The amount of the rescue fund, if all is tapped, amounts to \u20ac21,000 of new debt for each person in the nation of 47 million where the average annual salary for those with work is about the same amount and the unemployment rate for those under age 25 is 52 percent.<\/p><p>The country is already reeling from deep austerity cuts Rajoy has imposed over the last six months that have raised taxes, made it easier to hire and fire workers, and cut deep into cherished government programs including education and national health care.<\/p><p>\"It's obviously a shame,\" said civil servant Luisa Saraguren, 44, as she strolled on a sunny Sunday morning with her young daughter. \"But this bailout was fully predictable, and the consequences of this help are going to be a lot bigger compared to the cuts we've been living with already.\"<\/p><p>Rajoy took pains to avoid the word bailout Sunday, saying Spain's rescue package is a line of credit that its most troubled banks will be able to tap. The assistance will not come with the outside control over government macroeconomic policy like that imposed Greece, Ireland and Portugal when their public finances were bailed out.<\/p><p>He said interest rates on the loans will be considerably lower than the rate near 7 percent that Spain has been forced to pay recently on the international debt markets, a level that forced the other countries to seek bailouts.<\/p><p>Spain will regain the economic credibility it has lost by shoring up its banks, which will result in credit being restored so businesses and individuals shut off from loans can start borrowing and the economy will grow again, Rajoy insisted, again without saying when.<\/p><p>Europe's widening recession and financial crisis has hurt companies and investors around the world. Providing a financial lifeline to Spanish banks is likely to relieve anxiety on the Spanish economy \u2014 which is five times larger than Greece's \u2014 and on markets concerned about the country's ability to pay its way.<\/p><p>Spain's financial problems are not due to Greek-style government over-spending. The country's banks particularly its savings banks or \"cajas,\" got caught up in the collapse of a real estate bubble in 2008 that got worse over the past four years. However, as Spain's leaders have struggled for a solution to their banking crisis, the country's borrowing costs have soared close to the level that forced the governments of Greece, Portugal and Ireland to seek rescues.<\/p><p>Some of Spain's banks are struggling with by toxic real estate loans and assets amid fears the problem will get worse as more jobless people can't pay their mortgages. The Bank of Spain says the toxic loans and assets total around \u20ac180 billion. Nationalized lender Bankia SA, which has requested \u20ac19 billion in aid, has \u20ac32 billion in toxic assets.

Recently, the Los Angeles based-comedian started working one very personal, serious experience into her routine.<\/p><p>on Monday to open up about a violent relationship with an ex boyfriend, sharing photos of her bruised arms and legs and explaining why she has decided to include discussions of the abuse in her stand-up.<\/p><p>\"Same girl in all of these photos (me). I've had an amazing year, and you've seen the highlights here, so these photos are an uncommon thing to share but not an uncommon issue,\" Stelling captions a collage of photos of her bruises and her onstage smile.<\/p><p>The comic, who released her album<\/p><p>this fall and has a Comedy Central special, was hesitant to openly talk about the abuse, especially within her professional world.<\/p><p>\"There are many reasons not to make an abusive relationship public, mostly fear. Scared of what people will think, scared it makes me look weak or unprofessional,\" she writes.<\/p><p>\"When friends or comics ask why we broke up, it's not easy or comfortable to reply; it doesn't seem like the appropriate thing to say at a stand-up show, a party or a wedding. It's embarrassing. I feel stupid. After being verbally, physically abused and raped, I dated him for two more months. It's not simple.\"<\/p><p>Ultimately, Stelling couldn't exclude such a significant piece of her story from her onstage persona, even if it meant risking ridicule from the close-knit comedy community.<\/p><p>\"After I broke up with him, he said, 'You're very open and honest in your stand-up, and I just ask that you consider me when you talk about your ex because everyone knows who you're talking about.' And I abided. I wrote vague jokes because we both live in L.A., and I didn't want to hurt him, start a war, press charges, be interrogated or harassed by him or his friends and family. I wanted to move on and forget because I didn't understand,\" Stelling shares.<\/p><p>\"I don't want revenge or to hurt him now, but it's unhealthy to keep this inside because my stand-up is pulled directly from my life.

The Stahlbergs also envisioned finishing the basement bedroom and bathroom for an au pair.<\/p><p>They also fell in love with the neighborhood.

She also served as curator and director of the Arlington Historical Museum and editor of the Cherrydale Citizens' Association newsletter.<\/p><p>Single-family homes, the Arlington public schools, access to bike trails and proximity to the District draw people to the neighborhood. Sometimes, though, they move in but stay only a few years. Finding a house in Cherrydale can involve the competitive process the Stahlbergs experienced.<\/p><p>About half a mile north of the Virginia Square and Ballston Metro stations on the Orange and Silver lines, Cherrydale has a variety of residences ranging from farmhouses to bungalows to Sears and Montgomery Ward kit homes with two to five or bedrooms or sometimes more.

The Maywood neighborhood claims the eastern half of those boundaries north of Lee Highway, lending something of an arrowhead shape to Cherrydale. Since 1908, the Cherrydale Citizens' Association has planned activities and resolved neighborhood concerns. In the 1970s and 1980s, people often referred to the neighborhood as Mayberry, according to Springston, 63. In 1948, her parents bought the house where she lives with her husband and son. It dates to 1890, Springston said.<\/p><p>In the neighborhood, 49 properties sold in the past year, according to Billy Buck, an associate broker at Buck & Associates. The lowest priced was a one-bedroom, one-bath condominium for $200,000; the highest priced was a five-bedroom, five-bath farmhouse at $1.63 million.

The president's push is part of a larger American effort to further isolate and increase pressure on Iran after accusing it of a plot to assassinate Saudi Arabia's ambassador to the United States.<\/p><p>If the United Nations' watchdog group agrees to publicize the evidence, including new data from recent months, it would almost certainly revive a debate that has been dormant during the Arab Spring about how aggressively the United States and its allies, including Israel, should move to halt Iran's suspected weapons program.<\/p><p>Over the longer term, several senior Obama administration officials said in interviews, they are mulling a ban on financial transactions with Iran's central bank \u2014 a move that has been opposed by China and other Asian nations. Also being considered is an expansion of the ban on the purchase of petroleum products sold by companies controlled by the country's elite military force, the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps.<\/p><p>The Revolutionary Guards are also believed to oversee the military side of the nuclear program, and they are the parent of the Quds Force, which Washington has accused of directing the assassination plot.<\/p><p>The proposed sanctions come as administration officials confront skepticism around the world about their allegations that Iran was behind the plot and limited options about what they can do \u2014 as well as growing pressure from Republicans and some Democrats in Congress to take tougher action against Iran, with the central bank and the oil industry high on lawmakers' lists.<\/p><p>All of the proposed sanctions carry with them considerable political and economic risks. Yukiya Amano, the cautious director general of the United Nations group, the International Atomic Energy Agency, talked publicly in September about publishing some of the most delicate data suggesting Iran worked on nuclear triggers and warheads. But officials who have spoken with him say he is concerned that his inspectors could be ejected from Iran, shutting the best, though narrow, window into its nuclear activities.<\/p><p>Similarly, China and Russia, among other major Iranian trading partners, have resisted further oil and financial sanctions, saying the goal of isolating Iran is a poor strategy. Even inside the Obama administration, some officials say they fear any crackdown on Iranian oil exports could drive up oil prices when the United States and European economies are weak. As one senior official put it, \"You don't want to tip the U.S. into a downturn just to punish the Iranians.\"<\/p><p>Senior administration officials, who would not speak publicly about internal negotiations over the sanctions, say no recommendation on acting against the central bank has gone to Mr. Obama, who vowed last week to make sure Iran would face the \"toughest sanctions\" for what he said was its role in the sensational scheme to hire a Mexican drug cartel to kill the Saudi envoy.<\/p><p>The decision to press the International Atomic Energy Agency was brewing even before the plot against the Saudi ambassador was discovered, but that discovery prompted the White House to pursue a full-court, public press of the agency to release the sensitive intelligence.<\/p><p>Officials familiar with the evidence say it creates extraordinarily uncomfortable questions for the Iranians to answer, but does not definitively point to the construction of a weapon. Instead, it details work on individual technologies essential for designing and detonating a nuclear device, including how to turn uranium into bomb fuel, how to cast conventional explosives in a shape that can set off a nuclear blast, and how to make detonators, generate neutrons to spur a chain reaction, measure detonation waves and make nose cones for missiles.<\/p><p>Tommy Vietor, the spokesman for the National Security Council, said Saturday that \"the United States believes that a comprehensive assessment would be invaluable for the international community in its consideration of Iran's nuclear program and what to do about it.\" Iran has declared that all of the documents suggesting work on how to create a weapon that could fit atop an Iranian missile are \"fabrications\" intended to justify an attack. The country has been the target of covert attacks, including the assassinations of some nuclear scientists and a computer worm that disabled some of Iran's nuclear centrifuges.<\/p><p>The Obama administration, since coming to office, has never publicly presented detailed evidence to back up its claim that Iran is driving toward a weapon or creating the technology to assemble one quickly, should it need it. But it has discussed the evidence widely with allies.<\/p><p>In part the administration has hesitated to discuss the evidence because, after the failure to find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq in 2003, any American evidence is considered suspect. Widespread questions about the plot against the Saudis last week underscored how deep those suspicions run.<\/p><p>But Iran is a different kind of case. Inspectors visit regularly, measuring Iran's output of uranium, including recent production of the material, enriched to 20 percent purity, that takes it far closer to the kind of fuel needed for a weapon. Iran said recently that it would produce more of the 20 percent enriched material than it needs for a small medical research reactor, which prompted new concerns that it is building a stockpile that could be converted to weapons use.","26":"I think there's a real possibility that there's going to be a substantial realignment in the political scene in this country, especially if nothing is done to satisfy these dissatisfied people.<\/p><p>The Trump phenomenon is really a reflection of what happened in the referendum, to some extent, and so is Podemos and so is Syriza and so is the Front National in France.<\/p><p>Unless the western world can somehow or other satisfy large numbers of its people that it can run the economy and the country in a way which is in their interests, I think you are going to finish up with this discontent.<\/p><p>If we are going to save liberal democracy, it's very important that something is done to get it back on track again.","27":"Jess Quinn is training for a 10km race.

The company currently supplies their weapons to 17,800 of the United States' roughly 18,000 law enforcement agencies.<\/p><p>The brand name Taser has become as synonymous with these devices as Kleenex or Xerox have to photocopies and tissues \u2013 a quirk of language known as a \"proprietary eponym\". The word has even become a verb, as people commonly speak of being \"Tased\" or \"Tasered\".<\/p><p>The word Taser, though, didn't start with the company: it's actually a loose acronym of the book Tom Swift and His Electric Rifle. Jack Cover, the inventor of the modern ECD, named his prototype after the YA sci-fi novel he loved, and the very idea for a less-lethal electric gun was largely inspired by the fictional one described in the book.<\/p><p>And while this quirky history is known among some in law enforcement and engineering circles, the innocence with which it's told \u2013 a curious inventor culling inspiration from the literature of his youth \u2013 belies a more sinister truth: the book itself is boldly racist.<\/p><p>Tom Swift and His Electric Rifle, published in New York in 1911 under the pen name Victor Appleton, is typical of the literature of its time: an imperialist adventure tale set against the backdrop of a wild and dark African continent. In it, the protagonist, Tom Swift, develops an electric rifle \u2013 a totally novel idea in 1911 \u2013 and decides to test it in Africa in the hunt for ivory.<\/p><p>Africa, in the context of the book, exists only as a frontier of underexploited resources ripe for the wealth accumulation of white men daring enough to attempt. \"Elephant shooting in Africa! My! With my new electric rifle ... what a fellow couldn't do in the dark continent!\"<\/p><p>\"With the price of ivory soaring,\" says Swift's veteran hunting companion, \"there's a chance for us all to get a lot of money.\"<\/p><p>While this unabashed entrepreneurial imperialism tends to read as a relic of a bygone age, today disproportionately white police departments in places like Ferguson, Missouri, often function similarly as the adventurers sent to do the dangerous work of this kind of wealth generation. Like in the book, black communities are often seen not as dynamic places where people live lives, but as sites for plunder.<\/p><p>Take, for example, the Department of Justice's March report on the prevalence of predatory, revenue-based policing in St Louis County: entire municipalities there, as elsewhere in the US, float their operating budgets and justify their own existence on the racially biased extraction of statutory fees from primarily black residents. This scheme has only begun to decline because of the protests and organizing that defined Ferguson in the wake of Mike Brown's death.<\/p><p>In the book, as in America today, the black people are rendered as either passive, simple and childlike, or animalistic and capable of unimaginable violence. They are described in the book at various points as \"hideous in their savagery, wearing only the loin cloth, and with their kinky hair stuck full of sticks\", and as \"wild, savage and ferocious ... like little red apes\".<\/p><p>Swift and his travel companions quickly determine the blacks, scarcely human, need to be controlled, guided or killed as determined by the more \"civilized\" white outsiders.<\/p><p>Consider then how quickly the black people of Ferguson were rendered something less than fully human in the wake of Mike Brown's killing: an on-duty Ferguson police officer, a former NYPD commissioner and a popular actor all spared no time in invoking the discourse of \"animals\" in reference to black protesters. Near and far, incredulous commentators sought to cast the police as the sole defenders of black communities, and the only thing standing between those communities and self-destruction.<\/p><p>\"White police officers wouldn't be there if you weren't killing each other,\" former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani said on Meet the Press last November. Echoing Swift's rank paternalism, he later added: \"I probably saved more black lives as mayor of New York City than any mayor in the history of this city.\"<\/p><p>In the book, when Swift and his companions proudly use their advanced weapons \u2013 particularly the electric rifle \u2013 to dispatch with an incoming buffalo stampede, they too happily celebrate themselves as saviors.<\/p><p>\"Had it not been for the white men, the native village, which consisted of only frail huts, would have been completely wiped out by the animals,\" the novel reads.<\/p><p>Being named after a racist book doesn't make a company or device racist, any more than a person being named after a racist relative makes them so. A name is just that \u2013 and a Taser on its face is no more racist than the city or state of Washington are, simply for being named after our slaveholding first president.<\/p><p>But as recent campus activism in places such as Harvard and Princeton have demonstrated, there is real value in coming to terms with the bigotry embedded in the seemingly innocuous names and symbols of even our most ordinary, and aspirationally colorblind, institutions.<\/p><p>Being aware of the history of the word Taser should make us pause and consider that, every day, predominantly white police officers walk into predominantly black communities armed with weapons first imagined in a book in which \"civilized\" whites entered the black wilds for the purpose of plunder, only to cast themselves as the saviors of the natives. It isn't meaningless that today that sequence sometimes appears to persist in reverse.","29":"WASHINGTON \u2014 President Obama is pressing United Nations nuclear inspectors to release classified intelligence information showing that Iran is designing and experimenting with nuclear weapons technology.

Even inside the Obama administration, some officials say they fear any crackdown on Iranian oil exports could drive up oil prices when the United States and European economies are weak. As one senior official put it, \"You don't want to tip the U.S. into a downturn just to punish the Iranians.\"<\/p><p>Senior administration officials, who would not speak publicly about internal negotiations over the sanctions, say no recommendation on acting against the central bank has gone to Mr. Obama, who vowed last week to make sure Iran would face the \"toughest sanctions\" for what he said was its role in the sensational scheme to hire a Mexican drug cartel to kill the Saudi envoy.<\/p><p>The decision to press the International Atomic Energy Agency was brewing even before the plot against the Saudi ambassador was discovered, but that discovery prompted the White House to pursue a full-court, public press of the agency to release the sensitive intelligence.<\/p><p>Officials familiar with the evidence say it creates extraordinarily uncomfortable questions for the Iranians to answer, but does not definitively point to the construction of a weapon. Instead, it details work on individual technologies essential for designing and detonating a nuclear device, including how to turn uranium into bomb fuel, how to cast conventional explosives in a shape that can set off a nuclear blast, and how to make detonators, generate neutrons to spur a chain reaction, measure detonation waves and make nose cones for missiles.<\/p><p>Tommy Vietor, the spokesman for the National Security Council, said Saturday that \"the United States believes that a comprehensive assessment would be invaluable for the international community in its consideration of Iran's nuclear program and what to do about it.\" Iran has declared that all of the documents suggesting work on how to create a weapon that could fit atop an Iranian missile are \"fabrications\" intended to justify an attack. The country has been the target of covert attacks, including the assassinations of some nuclear scientists and a computer worm that disabled some of Iran's nuclear centrifuges.<\/p><p>The Obama administration, since coming to office, has never publicly presented detailed evidence to back up its claim that Iran is driving toward a weapon or creating the technology to assemble one quickly, should it need it. But it has discussed the evidence widely with allies.<\/p><p>In part the administration has hesitated to discuss the evidence because, after the failure to find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq in 2003, any American evidence is considered suspect. Widespread questions about the plot against the Saudis last week underscored how deep those suspicions run.<\/p><p>But Iran is a different kind of case. Inspectors visit regularly, measuring Iran's output of uranium, including recent production of the material, enriched to 20 percent purity, that takes it far closer to the kind of fuel needed for a weapon. Iran said recently that it would produce more of the 20 percent enriched material than it needs for a small medical research reactor, which prompted new concerns that it is building a stockpile that could be converted to weapons use.","30":"Jim Herron Zamora, Chronicle Staff Writer<\/p><p>Larry and Muriel fight back tears as they leave the courthouse after hearing that their son Darren Ray was found the guilty of killing Terrance Kelly, Wednesday Oct. 11, 2006, in Martinez, Ca.

He said that the defendant feared for his life in an unrelated dispute and accidentally shot Kelly as the football player was waiting in a car to give his stepbrother, Brandon Young, a ride home from his girlfriend's house in Richmond's Iron Triangle District.<\/p><p>Laba argued that Pratcher should be convicted of manslaughter because the death was \"a tragic mistake.\"<\/p><p>But prosecutor David Brown told jurors Kelly's death amounted to \"cold-blooded murder,\" because Pratcher was determined to kill someone that night. Brown argued that Pratcher had the opportunity to notice that Kelly was in the car before grabbing the rifle, advancing on the Oldsmobile and opening fire.<\/p><p>\"It's totally unfair for them to say it was premeditated,\" said Pratcher's father, Larry Sr. \"Terrance just came right up; it's impossible for it to be premeditated. It's totally unfair -- my son is not guilty of first degree murder.\"<\/p><p>Pratcher was 15 years old when Kelly was killed and was tried as an adult in Contra Costa County Superior Court. He faces and faces a maximum sentence of 25 years to life.<\/p><p>Kelly died two days before he was to leave for the University of Oregon, where he had a football scholarship and was expected top play safety.

Several witnesses placed Pratcher at the crime scene with the rifle, and at least two told investigators they saw him fire into Kelly's car.<\/p><p>Brown offered no motive for the crime but said Pratcher told a friend: \"I had to do what I had to do.\"","31":"Disunion follows the Civil War as it unfolded.<\/p><p>The Lincoln administration may not have gone to war in 1861 to end slavery, but no one bothered to tell that to the slaves. Within six weeks of the firing on Fort Sumter, Gen. Benjamin Butler was forced to decide what to do with three slaves who escaped to Fortress Monroe on the north shore of Virginia's James River. Butler, certainly no abolitionist, nonetheless refused to return the three to their owner, labeling them \"contrabands of war.\"<\/p><p>The term, suitably ambiguous for an administration that as yet had no policy on how to handle the fugitives, found immediate acceptance. As one Union officer wrote, \"Never was a word so speedily adopted by so many people in so short a time.\" Within weeks hundreds of \"contrabands\" \u2014 men, women and children \u2014 flocked to Fortress Monroe and other Union Army positions. Unsure what might greet them, the escaped slaves were yet confident that life under federal control must surely represent an improvement.<\/p><p>It took the federal government more than a year to devise a policy in answer to this thirst for freedom. In August 1861, the First Confiscation Act stripped slaveholders of their claim of ownership, but it failed to clarify whether the slaves were themselves free. The following March Congress prohibited the military from sending escaped slaves back into slavery, and in July the Second Confiscation Act decreed that all slaves that took refuge in Union areas were \"captives of war\" and would be set free.<\/p><p>These legislative actions took on ever greater significance as Union forces moved deeper and deeper into Confederate territory. The growing number of contrabands reaching federal lines necessitated the establishment of dozens of impromptu contraband camps. A draft map compiled by the National Park Service illustrates how the network of these generally transitory camps mirrored the advance of the Union Army along the Mississippi, Tennessee and Cumberland River systems. Grant's Army of the Tennessee spent the summer of 1862 protecting supply lines in western Tennessee and northern Mississippi. Victories at the Battle of Iuka in September and the Battle of Corinth in early October solidified Union control of the area.<\/p><p>Lincoln's announcement of the preliminary Emancipation Proclamation on Sept. 22, 1862, produced an even greater flood of refugees. How best to use and care for these contrabands proved particularly vexing for military leaders under Grant's command. \"You have no idea of the consternation Old Abe's Proclamation is making,\" wrote Gen. Grenville Dodge to his brother in September. The contrabands \"will not even wait until 1st January. I do not know what we shall do with them.\"<\/p><p>Many of these fugitives arrived in an appalling condition. \"There were men, women, and children in every stage of disease or decrepitude often nearly naked, with flesh torn by the terrible experiences of their escape,\" wrote one observer. \"Often the slaves met prejudices against their color more bitter than any they had left behind.\"<\/p><p>On Nov. 11, 1862, Grant took the first step toward addressing the crisis: he named John Eaton, a former high school principal and chaplain of the 27th Ohio Infantry, as superintendent of contrabands and set him at work \"organizing them into suitable companies for working.\" A month later he went further. \"The negroes will be clothed, and in every way provided for, out of their earnings\" \u2014 about 12.5 cents for each pound of cotton picked \u2014 \"so far as practicable,\" he ordered. \"In no case will negroes be forced into the service of the Government, or be enticed away from their homes except when it becomes a military necessity.\"<\/p><p>Grant's policies lent the contraband camps an official status and began to define what a freedman could and could not do once within the Union lines. Personally, Grant appears to have had no particular sympathy for the refugees. He seems to have recognized that, in the words of one observer, \"The soldiers of our army were a good deal opposed to serving the Negro in any manner.\" Nevertheless, the Union commander unreservedly supported Eaton's work and in the process enabled the creation of one of the war's most successful contraband camps, located at Corinth, Miss.<\/p><p>Although formally organized under the direction of General Dodge in early December 1862 and placed under the command of James M. Alexander, chaplain of the 66th Illinois, the Corinth camp likely came into existence as early as September. Initially housed in army tents no longer considered serviceable for Union troops, the freedmen were soon set to work downing trees and clearing land on which to build cabins and lay out streets, which were named for Union generals. Eventually the freedmen also built a four-room school, a commissary, a hospital, a church and an office. The entire camp was divided into wards, complete with ward masters and a police force.<\/p><p>In late 1862 the American Missionary Association sent its first volunteers to Corinth to help care for, educate and minister to the freedmen. In a memoir written years after the war, one such missionary recalled her experience. \"When brought face to face with the slaves,\" she wrote, \"it was like the discovery of a new race.\" The men and women who came to Corinth generally shared a paternalistic optimism and viewed the freedmen as childlike in their enthusiasm for both education and salvation.<\/p><p>The freedmen's thirst for knowledge was undeniable. \"You will find them every hour of daylight, at their books,\" observed the Rev. Edward Pierce in March of 1863. \"We cannot enter a cabin, or tent, but that we see from one to three with books.\" Within no time Pierce and his wife had more than 150 students, and by the end of the summer, the addition of more missionaries enabled the school to accommodate between 300 and 400 children as well as 60 adults at a night school. In August, one of the teachers estimated that as many as 1,000 freedmen had learned to read in the Corinth camp.<\/p><p>Organized religion followed closely on the heels of formal education. Reverend Olds \"saw an earnestness in reference to the Christian life that I have seldom seen. And as I saw their deep earnestness & heard their hearty responses,\" he said, \"I was led to ask where can we find a more impressible people than these?\"<\/p><p>The population of the camp fluctuated between 1,500 and 6,000, as large groups undertook assignments for the Union Army or contracted to work on local plantations. In March 1863, for example, the camp was home to 658 men, 1,440 women and 1,559 children. Among the men were 36 blacksmiths, 48 carpenters, 180 teamsters and 200 cooks. The female ranks included 80 seamstresses, 150 laundresses and 600 cooks. Two-thirds of the men and three-quarters of the women were married, and seven in eight women had children. According to John Eaton's records, the camp had experienced 900 cases of illness, 189 deaths and 45 births.<\/p><p>Life at Corinth changed dramatically after a May 1863 visit by Adj. Gen. Lorenzo Thomas, who was intent on recruiting thousands of contrabands for his newly formed black regiments. With the organization of the 1st Alabama Infantry of African Descent, later renamed the 55th United States Colored Troops, the camp lost most of its able-bodied men.<\/p><p>Their departure to fight left only the women, the young, the old and the infirm to carry on Eaton's ambitious agricultural program, which rested on the cooperative farming of large tracts of abandoned and confiscated land. The program put 400 acres under cultivation, 300 for cotton and 100 for vegetables. Each cabin also had its own subsistence garden. By May 1863, the success of the agricultural program and the presence of a multitude of skilled artisans produced a clear monthly profit of $4,000 to $5,000 for the government, as well as an admirably independent community that Eaton hoped might serve as a model for other camps.<\/p><p>Unfortunately, the success of the Corinth camp proved short-lived. Plans for a winter campaign by Union forces in January 1864 provided a grim reminder that the fate of the freedmen was always secondary to the triumph of the Union cause. The order to relocate the camp's inhabitants 93 miles westward, to Memphis, \"fell like a bomb-shell among our contented people,\" lamented one missionary, \"but military orders are preemptory,\" and they \"must be obeyed.\" The freedmen left their \"well-organized village,\" gardens and farms to tdiv><\/p><p>The move from Corinth destroyed the spirit that had animated the freedmen's success. Some of the new refugees found work on confiscated plantations or in Memphis, but most lived in one of several camps surrounding the city.<\/p><p>\"The destruction of the Corinth camp,\" noted one historian, \"was one of the tragedies of the Civil War.\" Eaton's plan for large-scale cooperative farming fell victim to a bitter struggle between the War and Treasury departments over the leasing of plantations and was never implemented elsewhere. And no more than one or two other camps were able to replicate the strong civilian leadership, well-planned and policed living environment, and emphasis on education that made Corinth a success.<\/p><p>Had the government learned from the model fashioned in northern Mississippi between the fall of 1862 and early 1864, the newly freed slaves might well have enjoyed a far easier transition to life in postwar America.<\/p><p>Sources: Joseph E.

It's been nearly two decades since pictures of this sort were produced with any regularity by the studio system, and a lot longer since they were stateside successes. Many of the attempts in recent years have been, at best, mid-budget passion projects with circumscribed audiences (Stallone's own<\/p><p>which topped out at $42 million domestically) or post-modern winks (the French-language \"JCVD\" from 2008, a hostage movie in which Jean-Claude Van Damme plays a version of himself). The few large-scale attempts, like \"The A-Team,\" underperformed. (The biceps-and-bullets remake grossed $77 million domestically, a number that will likely be easily surpassed by \"The Expendables.\")<\/p><p>But the Stallone picture -- with its hard-charging, take-no-prisoners patriotism unbothered by the vagaries of the real world (it takes place in a fictional country, for starters) and its caricature of freedom-hating enemies (\"We will kill this American disease,\" as the TV spot enticed us) -- planted itself squarely in the old-school genre. And this weekend, the movie showed that there's life in that category yet. That \"Scott Pilgrim vs. the World,\" the tongue-in-cheek, pop-culture-referential, decidedly 2010 creation -- the one for, of and by arch fanboys -- trailed well behind \"The Expendables\" only drove home the point more loudly.<\/p><p>On one hand, it's understandable that a movie of easy American heroism (OK, first-world Western heroism) would catch on. In fact, it's surprising it didn't happen sooner. Apple-pie-patriotism already is behind the success of a cable news network and supports large sections of the contemporary country music industry. Why not a film hit too?<\/p><p>But among all the factors to which one might point in explaining the success of \"The Expendables\" -- a cast harvested from so many demographics and eras; a moviegoer backlash to 3-D and CG effects -- it somehow doesn't feel that the demand for neat heroes and villains is one of them.<\/p><p>Norris and his ilk would submit that in our current period of ideological and geopolitical upheaval, in a time of blurry lines between enemies and friends in places such as Afghanistan and Iraq, that black-and-white heroes slake a patriotic thirst (and that, indeed, the movie-going world can support a lot more of them). But history argues the opposite: Those movies succeed when the culture at large is filled with clear-cut distinctions. On the other hand, when the zeitgeist is more cloudy, an entirely different kind of cinema prospers.<\/p><p>The post-WWII era and its mainly straightforward distinctions between good and evil, to take an example of the former, yielded a flowering subgenre of movies with morally uncomplicated gunslingers. And 30 years later, the ideological simplicity of the Cold War and its larger-than-life Evil Empire gave rise to the very action movies on which \"Expendables\" is modeled (not to mention the ultimate in us-versus-them confections, \"Rocky IV.\" Yes, there's a Stallone-ishness to all of this). There are plenty of reasons why these types of movies faded from view in the 1990s, but the fall of the Berlin Wall and the the Soviet Union certainly played a part.<\/p><p>The examples are just as abundant on the other side. The ambiguities of the Vietnam War and the counterculture in the late 1960s and early 1970s undoubtedly offered up the moral murkiness of<\/p><p>\"Midnight Cowboy\" and scores of others. In the post-9\/11 world, meanwhile, movies like<\/p><p>-- with its themes of a destruction-bent enemy that can't be bargained with, and the question of what constitutes an acceptable ethical compromise in fighting that enemy -- have captured our imagination. You can throw<\/p><p>in there too, to the degree the movie was a contemplation of Western interests in the Middle East.<\/p><p>Political eras are, of course, rarely just one thing or another, and the movies we want to see in a given period are hardly monolithic. But as tempting as it is to infer that the success of \"The Expendables\" shows a deeper cultural need, it may well be the wrong inference. When times are confusing, we want movies to reflect that confusion, and even to make sense of it. But we probably don't want to pretend that confusion doesn't exist.<\/p><p>Photo: A scene from \"The Expendables.\" Credit: Lionsgate<\/p><p>Stallone: I'm contemplating an \"Expendables\" sequel<\/p><p>Hollywood wonders if Schwarzenegger will be back","33":"Despite the firestorm over his comments about rape and pregnancy, Representative Todd Akin says he has no plans to drop out as the Republican Senate nominee in Missouri.<\/p><p>But what if he did?<\/p><p>The procedures in Missouri to change nominees midstream are complicated and intended to discourage just the sort of change that many in the Republican Party say they are eager to see happen.<\/p><p>\"As more time passes, you're starting to go up against deadlines,\" said Stacie Temple, a spokeswoman for Missouri's secretary of state, Robin Carnahan, a Democrat.

Mr. Akin would merely have to file the necessary papers with the court and his name would no longer be printed on the November ballot. Republicans could then quickly nominate someone else to run against Senator Claire McCaskill, the Democratic incumbent.<\/p><p>Democrats would no doubt like to see Mr. Akin \u2014 now politically weakened by his comments on rape and pregnancy \u2014 stay in the race. In theory, the Democratic officials who run the state's election offices could object to Mr. Akin's request for a court order, a move that would force a hearing before a judge.<\/p><p>The relevant statute says someone like Mr. Akin can withdraw \"pursuant to a court order, which, except for good cause shown by the election authority in opposition thereto, shall be freely given upon application by the candidate to the circuit court in the county of such candidate's residence.\"<\/p><p>Election officials say they can find no precedent at all for such an objection in the state's history. But Ms. Carnahan is herself a factor in Republican minds. As the Democratic Senate nominee in 2010, she lost to Representative Roy Blunt, and Republicans imagine she could put up a fight.<\/p><p>\"The secretary's job is to protect the rights of Missouri voters,\" Ms. Temple said when asked whether Ms. Carnahan would fight a court order to remove Mr. Akin's name from the ballot.<\/p><p>A further complication: Under state law, any election authority in Missouri can oppose a withdrawal order, down to the county and city level, and there are Democrats aplenty in Missouri. But Ms. Temple added that right now, it would be up to a Missouri court to determine whether Mr. Akin could withdraw, not the secretary of state.<\/p><p>\"It's completely in the hands of the court to decide the facts,\" she said.<\/p><p>Assuming Mr. Akin does manage to drop out, the state central committee of the Republican Party in Missouri would have to pick a new candidate within 28 days, or by Oct. 12, whichever comes first.","34":"Though it may feel out of the way \u2014 far, far east on the Lower East Side \u2014 there's no missing American Realness once you get there.

Humans and reptiles slid over and around one another.<\/p><p>This was just the first of many tenuously related, increasingly chaotic episodes, including the arrival of two Chihuahuas (the snakes, not to worry, had exited) and a migration into the adjacent black-box theater for a ritualistic ringing of hand-held bells. A mysterious voice, accompanying a video projection, pronounced, \"This piece will not save us.\" Ms. Lacey, cradling a small, three-legged dog while bending and stretching her limbs, told a story about an artist and an institution (Realness, perhaps) trying to spice up their relationship like old lovers.

As one Union officer wrote, \"Never was a word so speedily adopted by so many people in so short a time.\" Within weeks hundreds of \"contrabands\" \u2014 men, women and children \u2014 flocked to Fortress Monroe and other Union Army positions. Unsure what might greet them, the escaped slaves were yet confident that life under federal control must surely represent an improvement.<\/p><p>It took the federal government more than a year to devise a policy in answer to this thirst for freedom. In August 1861, the First Confiscation Act stripped slaveholders of their claim of ownership, but it failed to clarify whether the slaves were themselves free. The following March Congress prohibited the military from sending escaped slaves back into slavery, and in July the Second Confiscation Act decreed that all slaves that took refuge in Union areas were \"captives of war\" and would be set free.<\/p><p>These legislative actions took on ever greater significance as Union forces moved deeper and deeper into Confederate territory. The growing number of contrabands reaching federal lines necessitated the establishment of dozens of impromptu contraband camps. A draft map compiled by the National Park Service illustrates how the network of these generally transitory camps mirrored the advance of the Union Army along the Mississippi, Tennessee and Cumberland River systems. Grant's Army of the Tennessee spent the summer of 1862 protecting supply lines in western Tennessee and northern Mississippi. Victories at the Battle of Iuka in September and the Battle of Corinth in early October solidified Union control of the area.<\/p><p>Lincoln's announcement of the preliminary Emancipation Proclamation on Sept. 22, 1862, produced an even greater flood of refugees. How best to use and care for these contrabands proved particularly vexing for military leaders under Grant's command. \"You have no idea of the consternation Old Abe's Proclamation is making,\" wrote Gen. Grenville Dodge to his brother in September. The contrabands \"will not even wait until 1st January. I do not know what we shall do with them.\"<\/p><p>Many of these fugitives arrived in an appalling condition. \"There were men, women, and children in every stage of disease or decrepitude often nearly naked, with flesh torn by the terrible experiences of their escape,\" wrote one observer. \"Often the slaves met prejudices against their color more bitter than any they had left behind.\"<\/p><p>On Nov. 11, 1862, Grant took the first step toward addressing the crisis: he named John Eaton, a former high school principal and chaplain of the 27th Ohio Infantry, as superintendent of contrabands and set him at work \"organizing them into suitable companies for working.\" A month later he went further. \"The negroes will be clothed, and in every way provided for, out of their earnings\" \u2014 about 12.5 cents for each pound of cotton picked \u2014 \"so far as practicable,\" he ordered. \"In no case will negroes be forced into the service of the Government, or be enticed away from their homes except when it becomes a military necessity.\"<\/p><p>Grant's policies lent the contraband camps an official status and began to define what a freedman could and could not do once within the Union lines. Personally, Grant appears to have had no particular sympathy for the refugees. He seems to have recognized that, in the words of one observer, \"The soldiers of our army were a good deal opposed to serving the Negro in any manner.\" Nevertheless, the Union commander unreservedly supported Eaton's work and in the process enabled the creation of one of the war's most successful contraband camps, located at Corinth, Miss.<\/p><p>Although formally organized under the direction of General Dodge in early December 1862 and placed under the command of James M. Alexander, chaplain of the 66th Illinois, the Corinth camp likely came into existence as early as September. Initially housed in army tents no longer considered serviceable for Union troops, the freedmen were soon set to work downing trees and clearing land on which to build cabins and lay out streets, which were named for Union generals. Eventually the freedmen also built a four-room school, a commissary, a hospital, a church and an office. The entire camp was divided into wards, complete with ward masters and a police force.<\/p><p>In late 1862 the American Missionary Association sent its first volunteers to Corinth to help care for, educate and minister to the freedmen. In a memoir written years after the war, one such missionary recalled her experience. \"When brought face to face with the slaves,\" she wrote, \"it was like the discovery of a new race.\" The men and women who came to Corinth generally shared a paternalistic optimism and viewed the freedmen as childlike in their enthusiasm for both education and salvation.<\/p><p>The freedmen's thirst for knowledge was undeniable. \"You will find them every hour of daylight, at their books,\" observed the Rev. Edward Pierce in March of 1863. \"We cannot enter a cabin, or tent, but that we see from one to three with books.\" Within no time Pierce and his wife had more than 150 students, and by the end of the summer, the addition of more missionaries enabled the school to accommodate between 300 and 400 children as well as 60 adults at a night school. In August, one of the teachers estimated that as many as 1,000 freedmen had learned to read in the Corinth camp.<\/p><p>Organized religion followed closely on the heels of formal education. Reverend Olds \"saw an earnestness in reference to the Christian life that I have seldom seen. And as I saw their deep earnestness & heard their hearty responses,\" he said, \"I was led to ask where can we find a more impressible people than these?\"<\/p><p>The population of the camp fluctuated between 1,500 and 6,000, as large groups undertook assignments for the Union Army or contracted to work on local plantations. In March 1863, for example, the camp was home to 658 men, 1,440 women and 1,559 children. Among the men were 36 blacksmiths, 48 carpenters, 180 teamsters and 200 cooks. The female ranks included 80 seamstresses, 150 laundresses and 600 cooks. Two-thirds of the men and three-quarters of the women were married, and seven in eight women had children. According to John Eaton's records, the camp had experienced 900 cases of illness, 189 deaths and 45 births.<\/p><p>Life at Corinth changed dramatically after a May 1863 visit by Adj. Gen. Lorenzo Thomas, who was intent on recruiting thousands of contrabands for his newly formed black regiments. With the organization of the 1st Alabama Infantry of African Descent, later renamed the 55th United States Colored Troops, the camp lost most of its able-bodied men.<\/p><p>Their departure to fight left only the women, the young, the old and the infirm to carry on Eaton's ambitious agricultural program, which rested on the cooperative farming of large tracts of abandoned and confiscated land. The program put 400 acres under cultivation, 300 for cotton and 100 for vegetables. Each cabin also had its own subsistence garden. By May 1863, the success of the agricultural program and the presence of a multitude of skilled artisans produced a clear monthly profit of $4,000 to $5,000 for the government, as well as an admirably independent community that Eaton hoped might serve as a model for other camps.<\/p><p>Unfortunately, the success of the Corinth camp proved short-lived. Plans for a winter campaign by Union forces in January 1864 provided a grim reminder that the fate of the freedmen was always secondary to the triumph of the Union cause. The order to relocate the camp's inhabitants 93 miles westward, to Memphis, \"fell like a bomb-shell among our contented people,\" lamented one missionary, \"but military orders are preemptory,\" and they \"must be obeyed.\" The freedmen left their \"well-organized village,\" gardens and farms to tdiv><\/p><p>The move from Corinth destroyed the spirit that had animated the freedmen's success. Some of the new refugees found work on confiscated plantations or in Memphis, but most lived in one of several camps surrounding the city.<\/p><p>\"The destruction of the Corinth camp,\" noted one historian, \"was one of the tragedies of the Civil War.\" Eaton's plan for large-scale cooperative farming fell victim to a bitter struggle between the War and Treasury departments over the leasing of plantations and was never implemented elsewhere. And no more than one or two other camps were able to replicate the strong civilian leadership, well-planned and policed living environment, and emphasis on education that made Corinth a success.<\/p><p>Had the government learned from the model fashioned in northern Mississippi between the fall of 1862 and early 1864, the newly freed slaves might well have enjoyed a far easier transition to life in postwar America.<\/p><p>Sources: Joseph E.

Fewer voters than expected turned out.<\/p><p>Editor's note: John Avlon is a CNN contributor and senior political columnist for Newsweek and The Daily Beast. He is co-editor of the book \"Deadline Artists: America's Greatest Newspaper Columns.\"<\/p><p>(CNN) -- Beneath Rick Santorum's stunning three-state sweep on Tuesday stands another stubborn sign of dissatisfaction with the status quo: Republican turnout is down.<\/p><p>I'm talking embarrassingly, disturbingly, hey-don't-you-know-it's-an-election-year bad. It is a sign of a serious enthusiasm gap among the rank and file, and a particularly bad omen for Mitt Romney and the GOP in the general election.<\/p><p>Here's the tale of the tape, state by state, beginning with Tuesday night: Minnesota had just more than 47,000 people turn out for its caucuses this year -- four years ago it was nearly 63,000 -- and Romney came in first, not a distant third as he did Tuesday night. In Colorado, more than 70,000 people turned out for its caucus in 2008 -- but in 2012 it was 65,000. And Missouri -- even making a generous discount for the fact that this was an entirely symbolic contest -- had 232,000 people turn out, less than half the number who did four years ago.<\/p><p>Even with months of pre-primary hype and attention solely devoted to the Republican field, turnout in this election cycle essentially flat-lined. In Iowa, a little more than 121,000 people voted, compared with nearly 119,000 four years before, when action in the Democratic caucuses absorbed most of the attention.<\/p><p>In New Hampshire, the same dynamic applied -- 245,000 voters turned out in 2012, compared with 241,000 four years before, despite Republicans being the only game in town and independents making up 47% of the total turnout in 2012, according to CNN exit polls. Take out the independent voters and you've got a deep net decline.<\/p><p>Always proudly rebellious, South Carolina has been the great outlier in this election cycle. With Newt Gingrich making an all-out push for conservatives in a conservative state, turnout was up almost 150,000 over four years before.<\/p><p>But in Florida, the decline became unmistakable. Maybe it decreased because the Romney and Gingrich campaigns, plus super PACS, spent more than $18 million in the Sunshine State on TV ads, of which 93% were negative in the last week alone, according to the Campaign Media Analysis Group. After all, negative ads depress turnout. But after all the mud was thrown, 1.6 million people turned out in the nation's fourth largest state, which might sound impressive until you compare it with the nearly 2 million who turned out in 2008.<\/p><p>Nevada was even worse, with 32,894 people turning out to vote in a state with more than 465,000 registered Republicans. Four years before, more than 44,300 participated in the caucus. Turnout was down more than 25% despite the GOP caucuses being the only game in town. Party officials were expecting a turnout of more than 70,000.<\/p><p>All this should be a wake-up call for the GOP. Despite an enormous amount of national media attention devoted to each of the states to date, the response has been a notable yawn among the Republican rank and file.<\/p><p>The turnout numbers are even worse when you compare them with the number of registered Republicans in each state that has voted to date.<\/p><p>The caucuses in particular bring out an unrepresentative sample of a state's Republican Party. For all the grass-roots romanticism, there has got to be a better way to pick a presidential nominee.<\/p><p>But the news is worst for Romney, long the presumptive front-runner in a party that tends to reward the man next in line.<\/p><p>\"Reluctantly Romney\" could be a bumper sticker, even for his supporters. The former Massachusetts governor has found it difficult to climb above 35% in national polls, meaning that a majority of Republicans still support someone else in a notably weak field. His vote margins and totals lag behind those of four years before, when he lost the nomination to John McCain in a crowded and comparatively competent field, although Minnesota is the first state he won in '08 and lost in 2012.<\/p><p>You reap what you sow, and part of the reason turnout is down is directly related to the problem of polarization. The Republican Party is more ideologically polarized than at any time in recent history. Therefore, it put up more purely right-wing candidates than it did four years before, when center-right leaders such as McCain and Rudy Giuliani were also in the race. A bigger tent inspired bigger turnout.<\/p><p>But the other reason is simple dissatisfaction with the candidates.<\/p><p>Republicans seem united in their anger against the president -- like the Democrats in 2004 -- but they are uninspired by their options. Draft movements for fantasy candidates ranging from Chris Christie to Mitch Daniels to Paul Ryan and even Jeb Bush have started and failed. Some party leaders show more enthusiasm for a hypothetical 2016 crop of candidates, including Marco Rubio and Bobby Jindal, than they do for the flawed choices before them in this election. Divided and dispirited is an odd place for the Republican Party to be so soon after the enthusiasms of the 2010 tea party-driven election.<\/p><p>The bottom line is that voter turnout matters. And what should be most troubling for Republicans is that this enthusiasm gap among the conservative base is accompanied by a lack of candidates who might appeal to independents and centrist swing voters in the general election. It is a double barrel of bad news for the Republican Party. The numbers can be spun and rationalized by professional partisan operatives all day long, but the fact remains -- voters just aren't turning out to cast their votes for this crop of conservative candidates in 2012.<\/p><p>Follow CNN Opinion on Twitter.<\/p><p>Join the conversation on Facebook.<\/p><p>The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John Avlon.","37":"While living in an apartment in Pentagon City, Stephanie Gimenez Stahlberg and her husband, Patrick Stahlberg, a software engineer, began searching for a house where they could raise their family.<\/p><p>With two children \u2014 now 31\/2 and 1 1\/2 \u2014 the Stahlbergs needed more space, including a study area for Stephanie, who is enrolled in a PhD program at the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies.<\/p><p>The house they found in Cherrydale, a neighborhood in North Arlington, met their expectations. Within two days on the market, however, there were 10 offers. \"Our was not the highest,\" Stephanie said. \"We wrote a letter to the owners about why we liked the house.\"<\/p><p>The letter, along with a photograph of the family, worked. What drew the Stahlbergs to the house were the solar panels and the trees and bushes \u2014 raspberries, blueberries, blackberries, strawberries, grapes, apples, plums and currants \u2014 growing organically on the property. The Stahlbergs also envisioned finishing the basement bedroom and bathroom for an au pair.<\/p><p>They also fell in love with the neighborhood. They would be within walking distance to a park and two libraries with story time for children.<\/p><p>\"We were trying to look at homes where we can walk to the Metro, or bike to the city or to the Metro,\" said Stephanie, 27.<\/p><p>Sears and Montgomery Ward kit houses: Cherrydale, once abundant with cherry orchards, is a family neighborhood dating to 1893. While many neighbors have lived in the area for as long as 60 years, newcomers move in and out these days, said Kathryn Holt Springston, who worked for the Smithsonian American History Tours Office as an educational specialist and historian for 28 years. She also served as curator and director of the Arlington Historical Museum and editor of the Cherrydale Citizens' Association newsletter.<\/p><p>Single-family homes, the Arlington public schools, access to bike trails and proximity to the District draw people to the neighborhood. Sometimes, though, they move in but stay only a few years. Finding a house in Cherrydale can involve the competitive process the Stahlbergs experienced.<\/p><p>About half a mile north of the Virginia Square and Ballston Metro stations on the Orange and Silver lines, Cherrydale has a variety of residences ranging from farmhouses to bungalows to Sears and Montgomery Ward kit homes with two to five or bedrooms or sometimes more. Many date from 1900 to 1930, though some of the older houses were purchased to be torn down and replaced with larger homes, including some built as recently as this year.<\/p><p>Living there: Cherrydale lies north of Interstate 66 and south of Lorcom Lane, stretching roughly from Utah Street on the west to the northward-curving interstate on the east. The Maywood neighborhood claims the eastern half of those boundaries north of Lee Highway, lending something of an arrowhead shape to Cherrydale. Since 1908, the Cherrydale Citizens' Association has planned activities and resolved neighborhood concerns. In the 1970s and 1980s, people often referred to the neighborhood as Mayberry, according to Springston, 63. In 1948, her parents bought the house where she lives with her husband and son. It dates to 1890, Springston said.<\/p><p>In the neighborhood, 49 properties sold in the past year, according to Billy Buck, an associate broker at Buck & Associates. The lowest priced was a one-bedroom, one-bath condominium for $200,000; the highest priced was a five-bedroom, five-bath farmhouse at $1.63 million. Twelve properties are on the market now, ranging from a one-bedroom, two-bath condo for $274,900 to a new five-bedroom, five-bath Craftsman house at $1.799 million.<\/p><p>Welcome wagon: The five-points intersection \u2014 Lee Highway, Old Dominion Drive, Quincy Street, Military Road and Quebec Street \u2014 is dotted with at least two car dealerships and other commercial establishments while nearby is a Safeway and the Cherrydale Hardware, which opened in 1938.<\/p><p>The Cherrydale Volunteer Fire House, built in 1919, is home to such events as the annual spaghetti dinner, concerts and for 90 years each December there is a visit from Santa Claus for children under 12. Other community events are the annual Fourth of July party and picnic at 21st and Stafford streets. A neighborhood with its own \"welcome wagon,\" Cherrydale has approximately 1,400 households and three parks as well as the Martha Custis Trail for biking, running and walking.<\/p><p>Schools: Glebe Elementary, Taylor Elementary, Swanson Middle, Kenmore Middle and Washington-Lee High.<\/p><p>Transit: The neighborhood is close to the Virginia Square or Ballston Metro stops on the Orange and Silver lines. Metro and Arlington Transit buses connect at Ballston and Virginia Square.

When the shoebox-shaped and nearly shoebox-size panini shop opened on Bedford Street 15 years ago, there was nothing quite like it in New York, a restaurant that kept things simple and kept prices low, serving flavorful food in a room that was just adorable enough that you could decide, midmeal, that maybe the two of you squeezed into the counter were there on a date, and not just grabbing a bite.<\/p><p>You have to fire up the Wayback Machine to better understand how 'ino helped change how this city eats. Fifteen years ago, New York was a bistro town. There was the old guard: Blue Ribbon, Le Gamin, Jules, Lucky Strike, Raoul's and a dozen others. Then in 1997, a newcomer opened in SoHo named Balthazar, which raised the stakes with its set direction and unlisted reservation line. Balthazar was white-hot: it had perfectly distressed mirrors, fresh and crusty bread, and although it was impossible to get a table unless you knew somebody who knew somebody, you could always go at midnight and eat at the bar.<\/p><p>Soon, New York was lousy with bistros. It was a good era if you wanted a kir, steak frites, escargot, fris\u00e9e lardon, profiteroles. Authenticity, or some version of it, was the point. Everybody was pressing butter into little ramekins to be served at room temperature, changing the paper covering the tablecloths before serving dessert.<\/p><p>Honestly, it was really fun. The restaurants were lively, intimate, sexy. So what if you could recite the menu before you set foot in the door? But if you were a young chef with a measure of vision and creativity, you were stuck either making onion soup and beet salad with goat cheese. Or you worked on the line executing the vision and creativity of an older chef in Midtown or TriBeCa. Prune hadn't yet opened. Neither had Diner. Brooklyn didn't have much of a food scene outside the restaurant row on Smith Street, which was anchored by Patois, a bistro. If you went to Williamsburg, it was to go to a party or to go dancing, not to eat. This was the landscape when Jason and Jennifer Denton opened 'ino on a quiet street in the West Village. The kitchen in the back was the size of a D.J. booth and used the technology of induction burners, which was novel at the time: it was a paninoteca that looked as if it belonged in New York rather than being shipped, tile by mirrored tile, from Milan.<\/p><p>The culinary vocabulary was Italian, but it wasn't sepia-toned and sentimental. Instead, there was a focus on ingredients at a time when, in New York at least, few people cared. It had simple food done well, and sometimes you encountered flavors that weren't lifted out of the songbook. I still have a 13-year-old memory of sharing a shredded duck sandwich with sweet relish, a combination that is about as authentically Italian as a functioning parliament. You could go to 'ino to get something familiar (prosciutto and cheese will never get old), but you could also try something new.<\/p><p>'Ino was a casual joint with integrity, an easygoing place where you could eat well as long as you didn't mind the wait. Today, we take this combination for granted, and expect all kitchens to put some effort into sourcing and display a little creativity no matter how limited the resources. That we do owes a little bit to 'ino.","40":"Tim Burrack, a northern Iowa farmer in his 44th growing season, has taken to keeping a wary eye out for unfamiliar vehicles around his 300 acres of genetically modified corn seeds.<\/p><p>Along with other farmers in this vast agricultural region, he has upped his vigilance ever since Mo Hailong and six other Chinese nationals were accused by U.S. authorities in 2013 of digging up seeds from Iowa farms and planning to send them back to China.<\/p><p>The case, in which Mo pleaded guilty in January, has laid bare the value\u2014and vulnerability\u2014of advanced food technology in a world with 7 billion mouths to feed, 1.36 billion of them Chinese.<\/p><p>Citing that case and others as evidence of a growing economic and national security threat to America's farm sector, U.S. law enforcement officials are urging agriculture executives and security officers to increase their vigilance and report any suspicious activity.<\/p><p>But on a March 30 visit to Iowa, Justice Department officials could offer little advice to ensure against similar thefts, underlining how agricultural technology lying in open fields can be more vulnerable than a computer network or a factory floor.<\/p><p>\"It may range down to traditional barriers like a fence and doing human patrols to making sure you get good visuals on what's occurring,\" Assistant Attorney General John Carlin, head of the Justice Department's national security division, said when touring Iowa State University.<\/p><p>But agriculture sector executives say fences and guards are not feasible, due to the high cost and impracticality of guarding hundreds of thousands of acres.<\/p><p>Tom McBride, intellectual property attorney at Monsanto\u2014one of the firms whose seeds were targeted by Mo\u2014said it safeguards its genetically modified organism (GMO) technology by protecting its computers, patenting seeds and keeping fields like Burrack's unmarked.

The FBI says it suspects he was given the location by workers for the seed companies, but did not charge any employees.<\/p><p>DuPont Pioneer and LG Seeds declined to comment for this story.<\/p><p>Mo, whose case was prosecuted by the Justice Department as a national security matter rather than a simple criminal case, now faces a sentence of up to five years in prison. Five others charged in the case are still wanted by the FBI and are believed to have fled to China or Argentina. Charges were dropped against a sixth Chinese suspect.<\/p><p>The number of international economic espionage cases referred to the FBI is rising, up 15% each year between 2009 and 2014 and up 53% in 2015. The majority of cases reported involve Chinese nationals, the U.S. law enforcement official told Reuters. In the agriculture sector, organic insecticide, irrigation equipment and rice, along with corn, are all suspected to have been targeted, including by Chinese nationals, the official said.<\/p><p>Mo Hongjian, vice president of Kings Nower Seed's parent company, Beijing Dabeinong Technology Group, declined to comment on the case or on the company's connection with the Chinese government.<\/p><p>The parent firm is privately owned, but says it receives government money for research in \"science and technology.\"<\/p><p>China bans commercial growing of GMO grains due to public opposition to the technology and imports of GMO corn have to be approved by the agriculture ministry. Still, President Xi called in 2014 for China to innovate and dominate the technique, which promises high yields through resistance to drought, pests and disease.<\/p><p>In January, a Greenpeace report found some Chinese farmers are illegally growing GMO corn whose strains belong to companies including Monsanto, Syngenta syt and DuPont Pioneer.<\/p><p>Monsanto, which supplies Burrack's seed, said it can block foreign groups who request to tour their lab and learning center in Huxley, Iowa. For the past few years, Monsanto says it has run its own background checks on Chinese delegations that ask for a tour, and, if they are approved, boosts security to be sure they do not steal anything or take pictures.<\/p><p>In Washington, U.S. senators have called for a review of the $43 billion deal by state-owned ChemChina to buy Swiss seed group Syngenta, which generates nearly a quarter of its revenue from North America.<\/p><p>Acquiring GMO seed and successfully recreating a corn plant would allow Chinese companies to skip over roughly eight years of research and $1.5 billion spent annually by Monsanto to develop the corn, the company says.<\/p><p>Burrack's farm itself was not targeted by Mo, though he grows the Monsanto parent seed that the Chinese national was digging for. Burrack grows the corn in two fields in front of and behind his house where he can watch them, a small part of his 2,800-acre farm.<\/p><p>He said he is told by Monsanto where and when to plant the parent seed, but has never been told to keep what he is planting a secret.<\/p><p>\"What no one seems to understand is that they're stealing from people like me,\" Burrack said. \"They're stealing the research that farmers pay for when they buy Monsanto seed.\"","41":"\"We don't want people coming back or visiting,\" Nugent said.

When the shoebox-shaped and nearly shoebox-size panini shop opened on Bedford Street 15 years ago, there was nothing quite like it in New York, a restaurant that kept things simple and kept prices low, serving flavorful food in a room that was just adorable enough that you could decide, midmeal, that maybe the two of you squeezed into the counter were there on a date, and not just grabbing a bite.<\/p><p>You have to fire up the Wayback Machine to better understand how 'ino helped change how this city eats. Fifteen years ago, New York was a bistro town. There was the old guard: Blue Ribbon, Le Gamin, Jules, Lucky Strike, Raoul's and a dozen others. Then in 1997, a newcomer opened in SoHo named Balthazar, which raised the stakes with its set direction and unlisted reservation line. Balthazar was white-hot: it had perfectly distressed mirrors, fresh and crusty bread, and although it was impossible to get a table unless you knew somebody who knew somebody, you could always go at midnight and eat at the bar.<\/p><p>Soon, New York was lousy with bistros. It was a good era if you wanted a kir, steak frites, escargot, fris\u00e9e lardon, profiteroles. Authenticity, or some version of it, was the point. Everybody was pressing butter into little ramekins to be served at room temperature, changing the paper covering the tablecloths before serving dessert.<\/p><p>Honestly, it was really fun. The restaurants were lively, intimate, sexy. So what if you could recite the menu before you set foot in the door? But if you were a young chef with a measure of vision and creativity, you were stuck either making onion soup and beet salad with goat cheese. Or you worked on the line executing the vision and creativity of an older chef in Midtown or TriBeCa. Prune hadn't yet opened. Neither had Diner. Brooklyn didn't have much of a food scene outside the restaurant row on Smith Street, which was anchored by Patois, a bistro. If you went to Williamsburg, it was to go to a party or to go dancing, not to eat. This was the landscape when Jason and Jennifer Denton opened 'ino on a quiet street in the West Village. The kitchen in the back was the size of a D.J. booth and used the technology of induction burners, which was novel at the time: it was a paninoteca that looked as if it belonged in New York rather than being shipped, tile by mirrored tile, from Milan.<\/p><p>The culinary vocabulary was Italian, but it wasn't sepia-toned and sentimental. Instead, there was a focus on ingredients at a time when, in New York at least, few people cared. It had simple food done well, and sometimes you encountered flavors that weren't lifted out of the songbook. I still have a 13-year-old memory of sharing a shredded duck sandwich with sweet relish, a combination that is about as authentically Italian as a functioning parliament. You could go to 'ino to get something familiar (prosciutto and cheese will never get old), but you could also try something new.<\/p><p>'Ino was a casual joint with integrity, an easygoing place where you could eat well as long as you didn't mind the wait. Today, we take this combination for granted, and expect all kitchens to put some effort into sourcing and display a little creativity no matter how limited the resources. That we do owes a little bit to 'ino.","45":"MADRID (AP) \u2013 Spain's grinding economic misery will get worse this year despite the country's request for a European financial lifeline of up to $125 billion to save its banks, Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said Sunday.<\/p><p>A day after the country conceded it needed outside help following months of denying it would seek assistance, Rajoy said more Spaniards will lose their jobs in a country where one out of every four are already unemployed.<\/p><p>\"This year is going to be a bad one,\" Rajoy said Sunday in his first comments about the rescue since it was announced the previous evening by his economy minister.<\/p><p>The conservative prime minister added that the economy, stuck in its second recession in three years, will still contract the previously predicted 1.7 percent even with the help. Small businesses and families starving for credit will eventually get relief as the funding props up banks and they increase lending, but Rajoy didn't offer guidance on when.<\/p><p>Spain on Saturday became the fourth \u2014 and largest \u2014 of the 17 countries that use Europe's common currency to request a bailout \u2014 a big blow to a nation that a few years ago took pride as the continent's economic superstar only to see it become the hot spot in the eurozone debt crisis. Its economy is the eurozone's fourth largest after Germany, France and Italy.<\/p><p>Across the country, Spaniards reacted with a mixture of anger and relief to the news. The amount of the rescue fund, if all is tapped, amounts to \u20ac21,000 of new debt for each person in the nation of 47 million where the average annual salary for those with work is about the same amount and the unemployment rate for those under age 25 is 52 percent.<\/p><p>The country is already reeling from deep austerity cuts Rajoy has imposed over the last six months that have raised taxes, made it easier to hire and fire workers, and cut deep into cherished government programs including education and national health care.<\/p><p>\"It's obviously a shame,\" said civil servant Luisa Saraguren, 44, as she strolled on a sunny Sunday morning with her young daughter. \"But this bailout was fully predictable, and the consequences of this help are going to be a lot bigger compared to the cuts we've been living with already.\"<\/p><p>Rajoy took pains to avoid the word bailout Sunday, saying Spain's rescue package is a line of credit that its most troubled banks will be able to tap. The assistance will not come with the outside control over government macroeconomic policy like that imposed Greece, Ireland and Portugal when their public finances were bailed out.<\/p><p>He said interest rates on the loans will be considerably lower than the rate near 7 percent that Spain has been forced to pay recently on the international debt markets, a level that forced the other countries to seek bailouts.<\/p><p>Spain will regain the economic credibility it has lost by shoring up its banks, which will result in credit being restored so businesses and individuals shut off from loans can start borrowing and the economy will grow again, Rajoy insisted, again without saying when.<\/p><p>Europe's widening recession and financial crisis has hurt companies and investors around the world. Providing a financial lifeline to Spanish banks is likely to relieve anxiety on the Spanish economy \u2014 which is five times larger than Greece's \u2014 and on markets concerned about the country's ability to pay its way.<\/p><p>Spain's financial problems are not due to Greek-style government over-spending. The country's banks particularly its savings banks or \"cajas,\" got caught up in the collapse of a real estate bubble in 2008 that got worse over the past four years. However, as Spain's leaders have struggled for a solution to their banking crisis, the country's borrowing costs have soared close to the level that forced the governments of Greece, Portugal and Ireland to seek rescues.<\/p><p>Some of Spain's banks are struggling with by toxic real estate loans and assets amid fears the problem will get worse as more jobless people can't pay their mortgages. The Bank of Spain says the toxic loans and assets total around \u20ac180 billion. Nationalized lender Bankia SA, which has requested \u20ac19 billion in aid, has \u20ac32 billion in toxic assets. Around four other banks serving the domestic market are considered prime candidates for bailouts.<\/p><p>\"I could never get my mind round the scale of consumption in Spain over the past 20 years, having known it in the 1960s when it was still extremely poor,\" said Paul Preston, a history professor and expert on Spain with the London School of Economics. \"Lots of people enjoyed the consumer boom, but not everybody. Now everybody's having to pay for it.\"<\/p><p>Rajoy blamed Spain's woes on the previous Socialist administration of Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero without mentioning him or his government by name. Zapatero was ousted by Rajoy in a landslide last November by voters outraged over the Socialist handling of the economy.<\/p><p>\"Last year Spain's public administration spent \u20ac90 billion more than it took in, this can't be maintained, we can't live like that,\" Rajoy said.<\/p><p>But Socialist Party leader Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba said Rajoy should acknowledge that Spain is now in bailout territory.<\/p><p>\"The government is trying to make us believe that we've won the lottery, that the Three Kings of Orient have arrived, and that isn't so,\" Rubalcaba said.<\/p><p>After his press conference, Rajoy defended his decision to jet off an hour later to Poland to see Spain's famed national football team take on Italy in the Euro 2012 competition. He said he would be on the ground in Gdansk only for the game before flying back to Madrid Sunday night.<\/p><p>\"I'll be there two and a half hours and then I'll leave,\" Rajoy said. \"I think the national team deserves it.\"","46":"Most people, asked to identify the most universal shift in law enforcement over the past 15 years, would likely think of militarization, calls for community policing, or perhaps the slow decline of \"broken windows\".<\/p><p>But from the turn of the millennium to date, arguably no development has been more widespread in law enforcement than the adoption of so called \"less-lethal\" electric control devices (ECD), which many people know by the name of their most prolific manufacturer: Taser International. The company currently supplies their weapons to 17,800 of the United States' roughly 18,000 law enforcement agencies.<\/p><p>The brand name Taser has become as synonymous with these devices as Kleenex or Xerox have to photocopies and tissues \u2013 a quirk of language known as a \"proprietary eponym\". The word has even become a verb, as people commonly speak of being \"Tased\" or \"Tasered\".<\/p><p>The word Taser, though, didn't start with the company: it's actually a loose acronym of the book Tom Swift and His Electric Rifle. Jack Cover, the inventor of the modern ECD, named his prototype after the YA sci-fi novel he loved, and the very idea for a less-lethal electric gun was largely inspired by the fictional one described in the book.<\/p><p>And while this quirky history is known among some in law enforcement and engineering circles, the innocence with which it's told \u2013 a curious inventor culling inspiration from the literature of his youth \u2013 belies a more sinister truth: the book itself is boldly racist.<\/p><p>Tom Swift and His Electric Rifle, published in New York in 1911 under the pen name Victor Appleton, is typical of the literature of its time: an imperialist adventure tale set against the backdrop of a wild and dark African continent. In it, the protagonist, Tom Swift, develops an electric rifle \u2013 a totally novel idea in 1911 \u2013 and decides to test it in Africa in the hunt for ivory.<\/p><p>Africa, in the context of the book, exists only as a frontier of underexploited resources ripe for the wealth accumulation of white men daring enough to attempt. \"Elephant shooting in Africa! My! With my new electric rifle ... what a fellow couldn't do in the dark continent!\"<\/p><p>\"With the price of ivory soaring,\" says Swift's veteran hunting companion, \"there's a chance for us all to get a lot of money.\"<\/p><p>While this unabashed entrepreneurial imperialism tends to read as a relic of a bygone age, today disproportionately white police departments in places like Ferguson, Missouri, often function similarly as the adventurers sent to do the dangerous work of this kind of wealth generation. Like in the book, black communities are often seen not as dynamic places where people live lives, but as sites for plunder.<\/p><p>Take, for example, the Department of Justice's March report on the prevalence of predatory, revenue-based policing in St Louis County: entire municipalities there, as elsewhere in the US, float their operating budgets and justify their own existence on the racially biased extraction of statutory fees from primarily black residents. This scheme has only begun to decline because of the protests and organizing that defined Ferguson in the wake of Mike Brown's death.<\/p><p>In the book, as in America today, the black people are rendered as either passive, simple and childlike, or animalistic and capable of unimaginable violence. They are described in the book at various points as \"hideous in their savagery, wearing only the loin cloth, and with their kinky hair stuck full of sticks\", and as \"wild, savage and ferocious ... like little red apes\".<\/p><p>Swift and his travel companions quickly determine the blacks, scarcely human, need to be controlled, guided or killed as determined by the more \"civilized\" white outsiders.<\/p><p>Consider then how quickly the black people of Ferguson were rendered something less than fully human in the wake of Mike Brown's killing: an on-duty Ferguson police officer, a former NYPD commissioner and a popular actor all spared no time in invoking the discourse of \"animals\" in reference to black protesters. Near and far, incredulous commentators sought to cast the police as the sole defenders of black communities, and the only thing standing between those communities and self-destruction.<\/p><p>\"White police officers wouldn't be there if you weren't killing each other,\" former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani said on Meet the Press last November. Echoing Swift's rank paternalism, he later added: \"I probably saved more black lives as mayor of New York City than any mayor in the history of this city.\"<\/p><p>In the book, when Swift and his companions proudly use their advanced weapons \u2013 particularly the electric rifle \u2013 to dispatch with an incoming buffalo stampede, they too happily celebrate themselves as saviors.<\/p><p>\"Had it not been for the white men, the native village, which consisted of only frail huts, would have been completely wiped out by the animals,\" the novel reads.<\/p><p>Being named after a racist book doesn't make a company or device racist, any more than a person being named after a racist relative makes them so. A name is just that \u2013 and a Taser on its face is no more racist than the city or state of Washington are, simply for being named after our slaveholding first president.<\/p><p>But as recent campus activism in places such as Harvard and Princeton have demonstrated, there is real value in coming to terms with the bigotry embedded in the seemingly innocuous names and symbols of even our most ordinary, and aspirationally colorblind, institutions.<\/p><p>Being aware of the history of the word Taser should make us pause and consider that, every day, predominantly white police officers walk into predominantly black communities armed with weapons first imagined in a book in which \"civilized\" whites entered the black wilds for the purpose of plunder, only to cast themselves as the saviors of the natives. It isn't meaningless that today that sequence sometimes appears to persist in reverse.","47":"Some things are more important than football, and Leah Still is doing something that's much harder than anything that can be done on a football field.<\/p><p>Former Cincinnati Bengals defensive lineman Devon Still announced on Instagram that his daughter Leah is cancer-free.<\/p><p>Leah Still, 5, was diagnosed with cancer in June 2014 and given a 50-50 chance to live.<\/p><p>The Bengals kept Still on their practice squad after cutting him last year, according to SI.com, and he eventually made the active roster and appeared in 12 games.<\/p><p>Still again was cut in September and is currently a free agent, but he'll take Leah kicking cancer over signing with a team any day.<\/p><p>More from The Sports Daily:","48":"While living in an apartment in Pentagon City, Stephanie Gimenez Stahlberg and her husband, Patrick Stahlberg, a software engineer, began searching for a house where they could raise their family.<\/p><p>With two children \u2014 now 31\/2 and 1 1\/2 \u2014 the Stahlbergs needed more space, including a study area for Stephanie, who is enrolled in a PhD program at the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies.<\/p><p>The house they found in Cherrydale, a neighborhood in North Arlington, met their expectations.

She also served as curator and director of the Arlington Historical Museum and editor of the Cherrydale Citizens' Association newsletter.<\/p><p>Single-family homes, the Arlington public schools, access to bike trails and proximity to the District draw people to the neighborhood. Sometimes, though, they move in but stay only a few years. Finding a house in Cherrydale can involve the competitive process the Stahlbergs experienced.<\/p><p>About half a mile north of the Virginia Square and Ballston Metro stations on the Orange and Silver lines, Cherrydale has a variety of residences ranging from farmhouses to bungalows to Sears and Montgomery Ward kit homes with two to five or bedrooms or sometimes more. Many date from 1900 to 1930, though some of the older houses were purchased to be torn down and replaced with larger homes, including some built as recently as this year.<\/p><p>Living there: Cherrydale lies north of Interstate 66 and south of Lorcom Lane, stretching roughly from Utah Street on the west to the northward-curving interstate on the east. The Maywood neighborhood claims the eastern half of those boundaries north of Lee Highway, lending something of an arrowhead shape to Cherrydale. Since 1908, the Cherrydale Citizens' Association has planned activities and resolved neighborhood concerns. In the 1970s and 1980s, people often referred to the neighborhood as Mayberry, according to Springston, 63. In 1948, her parents bought the house where she lives with her husband and son. It dates to 1890, Springston said.<\/p><p>In the neighborhood, 49 properties sold in the past year, according to Billy Buck, an associate broker at Buck & Associates. The lowest priced was a one-bedroom, one-bath condominium for $200,000; the highest priced was a five-bedroom, five-bath farmhouse at $1.63 million. Twelve properties are on the market now, ranging from a one-bedroom, two-bath condo for $274,900 to a new five-bedroom, five-bath Craftsman house at $1.799 million.<\/p><p>Welcome wagon: The five-points intersection \u2014 Lee Highway, Old Dominion Drive, Quincy Street, Military Road and Quebec Street \u2014 is dotted with at least two car dealerships and other commercial establishments while nearby is a Safeway and the Cherrydale Hardware, which opened in 1938.<\/p><p>The Cherrydale Volunteer Fire House, built in 1919, is home to such events as the annual spaghetti dinner, concerts and for 90 years each December there is a visit from Santa Claus for children under 12. Other community events are the annual Fourth of July party and picnic at 21st and Stafford streets. A neighborhood with its own \"welcome wagon,\" Cherrydale has approximately 1,400 households and three parks as well as the Martha Custis Trail for biking, running and walking.<\/p><p>Schools: Glebe Elementary, Taylor Elementary, Swanson Middle, Kenmore Middle and Washington-Lee High.<\/p><p>Transit: The neighborhood is close to the Virginia Square or Ballston Metro stops on the Orange and Silver lines.

Over the past two years, U.S. companies, government research facilities and universities have all been targeted, according to the FBI.<\/p><p>Although prosecutors were unable to establish a Chinese government link to Mo's group, the case adds to U.S.-China frictions over what Washington says is increasing economic espionage and trade secret theft by Beijing and its proxies.<\/p><p>A U.S. law enforcement official told Reuters the agency looked for a connection between the Chinese government and the conspiracy carried out by Mo.<\/p><p>\"In cases like this, we can see connections, but proving to the threshold needed in court requires that we have documents that the government has directed this,\" the official said. \"It's almost impossible to get.\"<\/p><p>A Chinese embassy spokesman in Washington, Zhu Haiquan, said he did not have detailed information on the Mo case but that China \"stands firm\" on the protection of intellectual property and maintains \"constant communication and cooperation\" with the U.S. government on the issue.<\/p><p>On his visit to Washington last September, President Xi Jinping reiterated China's denial of any government role in the hacking of U.S. corporate secrets.<\/p><p>Mo, an employee of Chinese firm Kings Nower Seed, pleaded guilty to stealing seed grown by U.S. firms Monsanto, Dupont Pioneer dd and LG Seeds.<\/p><p>Prosecutors say he specifically targeted fields that grow the parent seeds needed to replicate GMO corn. The FBI says it suspects he was given the location by workers for the seed companies, but did not charge any employees.<\/p><p>DuPont Pioneer and LG Seeds declined to comment for this story.<\/p><p>Mo, whose case was prosecuted by the Justice Department as a national security matter rather than a simple criminal case, now faces a sentence of up to five years in prison. Five others charged in the case are still wanted by the FBI and are believed to have fled to China or Argentina. Charges were dropped against a sixth Chinese suspect.<\/p><p>The number of international economic espionage cases referred to the FBI is rising, up 15% each year between 2009 and 2014 and up 53% in 2015. The majority of cases reported involve Chinese nationals, the U.S. law enforcement official told Reuters. In the agriculture sector, organic insecticide, irrigation equipment and rice, along with corn, are all suspected to have been targeted, including by Chinese nationals, the official said.<\/p><p>Mo Hongjian, vice president of Kings Nower Seed's parent company, Beijing Dabeinong Technology Group, declined to comment on the case or on the company's connection with the Chinese government.<\/p><p>The parent firm is privately owned, but says it receives government money for research in \"science and technology.\"<\/p><p>China bans commercial growing of GMO grains due to public opposition to the technology and imports of GMO corn have to be approved by the agriculture ministry. Still, President Xi called in 2014 for China to innovate and dominate the technique, which promises high yields through resistance to drought, pests and disease.<\/p><p>In January, a Greenpeace report found some Chinese farmers are illegally growing GMO corn whose strains belong to companies including Monsanto, Syngenta syt and DuPont Pioneer.<\/p><p>Monsanto, which supplies Burrack's seed, said it can block foreign groups who request to tour their lab and learning center in Huxley, Iowa. For the past few years, Monsanto says it has run its own background checks on Chinese delegations that ask for a tour, and, if they are approved, boosts security to be sure they do not steal anything or take pictures.<\/p><p>In Washington, U.S. senators have called for a review of the $43 billion deal by state-owned ChemChina to buy Swiss seed group Syngenta, which generates nearly a quarter of its revenue from North America.<\/p><p>Acquiring GMO seed and successfully recreating a corn plant would allow Chinese companies to skip over roughly eight years of research and $1.5 billion spent annually by Monsanto to develop the corn, the company says.<\/p><p>Burrack's farm itself was not targeted by Mo, though he grows the Monsanto parent seed that the Chinese national was digging for. Burrack grows the corn in two fields in front of and behind his house where he can watch them, a small part of his 2,800-acre farm.<\/p><p>He said he is told by Monsanto where and when to plant the parent seed, but has never been told to keep what he is planting a secret.<\/p><p>\"What no one seems to understand is that they're stealing from people like me,\" Burrack said. \"They're stealing the research that farmers pay for when they buy Monsanto seed.\"","50":"Milton Friedman (1912--2006), the champion of free-market economics and the hero of my student years at the University of Chicago, would have been appalled at the recent intrusion of government into the marketplace.

In the old days videotapes of ads were shipped to broadcasters. DG puts servers at broadcasters' sites that receive ads electronically, charging customers less than they'd pay for physical delivery.<\/p><p>Two-thirds of ads today are electronically distributed, and DG owns the lion's share of the market. As advertisers shoot more commercials in high definition, DG has the opportunity to boost revenue because it charges more for hd content. Juicy margins will invite competition, but DG's large network of stations creates a significant barrier to entry.

Two-thirds of its revenue comes from Sinovel, a state-owned Chinese company. That is both good and bad. The dependence on Sinovel was a big help during last year's downturn, but in the future it could be a significant risk. as also makes high-temperature superconducting wire with carrying capacity 150 times that of copper wire, perfect for the global upgrade to a more efficient electrical grid. The superconductor division is not yet profitable, but the rest of the business should earn $1.35 a share over the next year. I expect 30% annual earnings gains over the next five years.<\/p><p>Fuel Tech (FTEK, 10) develops technology to reduce nitrogen oxide (NOX) emissions from power plants. Fuel Tech stumbled last summer when the U.S. District Court of Appeals vacated the Environmental Protection Agency's rule spelling out timetables for NOX reduction across the eastern half of the U.S. In a surprise move the same Court of Appeals reinstated the Clean Air Interstate Rule in December, and it went into effect on Jan. 1 as originally scheduled. Fuel Tech also sells chemicals that are tossed into a coal burner to fight slag and thereby boost power plant efficiency. The company generates most of its revenue in the U.S., but management is looking to expand in emerging markets like China and eastern Europe, where pollution-control technology is still quite new.<\/p><p>Fuel Tech shares look expensive at 78 times my earnings projection of 15 cents a share for the 12 months beginning in July, but I expect rapid growth.

It's been nearly two decades since pictures of this sort were produced with any regularity by the studio system, and a lot longer since they were stateside successes. Many of the attempts in recent years have been, at best, mid-budget passion projects with circumscribed audiences (Stallone's own<\/p><p>which topped out at $42 million domestically) or post-modern winks (the French-language \"JCVD\" from 2008, a hostage movie in which Jean-Claude Van Damme plays a version of himself). The few large-scale attempts, like \"The A-Team,\" underperformed. (The biceps-and-bullets remake grossed $77 million domestically, a number that will likely be easily surpassed by \"The Expendables.\")<\/p><p>But the Stallone picture -- with its hard-charging, take-no-prisoners patriotism unbothered by the vagaries of the real world (it takes place in a fictional country, for starters) and its caricature of freedom-hating enemies (\"We will kill this American disease,\" as the TV spot enticed us) -- planted itself squarely in the old-school genre. And this weekend, the movie showed that there's life in that category yet. That \"Scott Pilgrim vs. the World,\" the tongue-in-cheek, pop-culture-referential, decidedly 2010 creation -- the one for, of and by arch fanboys -- trailed well behind \"The Expendables\" only drove home the point more loudly.<\/p><p>On one hand, it's understandable that a movie of easy American heroism (OK, first-world Western heroism) would catch on. In fact, it's surprising it didn't happen sooner. Apple-pie-patriotism already is behind the success of a cable news network and supports large sections of the contemporary country music industry. Why not a film hit too?<\/p><p>But among all the factors to which one might point in explaining the success of \"The Expendables\" -- a cast harvested from so many demographics and eras; a moviegoer backlash to 3-D and CG effects -- it somehow doesn't feel that the demand for neat heroes and villains is one of them.<\/p><p>Norris and his ilk would submit that in our current period of ideological and geopolitical upheaval, in a time of blurry lines between enemies and friends in places such as Afghanistan and Iraq, that black-and-white heroes slake a patriotic thirst (and that, indeed, the movie-going world can support a lot more of them). But history argues the opposite: Those movies succeed when the culture at large is filled with clear-cut distinctions. On the other hand, when the zeitgeist is more cloudy, an entirely different kind of cinema prospers.<\/p><p>The post-WWII era and its mainly straightforward distinctions between good and evil, to take an example of the former, yielded a flowering subgenre of movies with morally uncomplicated gunslingers. And 30 years later, the ideological simplicity of the Cold War and its larger-than-life Evil Empire gave rise to the very action movies on which \"Expendables\" is modeled (not to mention the ultimate in us-versus-them confections, \"Rocky IV.\" Yes, there's a Stallone-ishness to all of this). There are plenty of reasons why these types of movies faded from view in the 1990s, but the fall of the Berlin Wall and the the Soviet Union certainly played a part.<\/p><p>The examples are just as abundant on the other side. The ambiguities of the Vietnam War and the counterculture in the late 1960s and early 1970s undoubtedly offered up the moral murkiness of<\/p><p>\"Midnight Cowboy\" and scores of others. In the post-9\/11 world, meanwhile, movies like<\/p><p>-- with its themes of a destruction-bent enemy that can't be bargained with, and the question of what constitutes an acceptable ethical compromise in fighting that enemy -- have captured our imagination. You can throw<\/p><p>in there too, to the degree the movie was a contemplation of Western interests in the Middle East.<\/p><p>Political eras are, of course, rarely just one thing or another, and the movies we want to see in a given period are hardly monolithic. But as tempting as it is to infer that the success of \"The Expendables\" shows a deeper cultural need, it may well be the wrong inference. When times are confusing, we want movies to reflect that confusion, and even to make sense of it. But we probably don't want to pretend that confusion doesn't exist.<\/p><p>Photo: A scene from \"The Expendables.\" Credit: Lionsgate<\/p><p>Stallone: I'm contemplating an \"Expendables\" sequel<\/p><p>Hollywood wonders if Schwarzenegger will be back","57":"Disunion follows the Civil War as it unfolded.<\/p><p>The Lincoln administration may not have gone to war in 1861 to end slavery, but no one bothered to tell that to the slaves. Within six weeks of the firing on Fort Sumter, Gen. Benjamin Butler was forced to decide what to do with three slaves who escaped to Fortress Monroe on the north shore of Virginia's James River. Butler, certainly no abolitionist, nonetheless refused to return the three to their owner, labeling them \"contrabands of war.\"<\/p><p>The term, suitably ambiguous for an administration that as yet had no policy on how to handle the fugitives, found immediate acceptance. As one Union officer wrote, \"Never was a word so speedily adopted by so many people in so short a time.\" Within weeks hundreds of \"contrabands\" \u2014 men, women and children \u2014 flocked to Fortress Monroe and other Union Army positions. Unsure what might greet them, the escaped slaves were yet confident that life under federal control must surely represent an improvement.<\/p><p>It took the federal government more than a year to devise a policy in answer to this thirst for freedom. In August 1861, the First Confiscation Act stripped slaveholders of their claim of ownership, but it failed to clarify whether the slaves were themselves free. The following March Congress prohibited the military from sending escaped slaves back into slavery, and in July the Second Confiscation Act decreed that all slaves that took refuge in Union areas were \"captives of war\" and would be set free.<\/p><p>These legislative actions took on ever greater significance as Union forces moved deeper and deeper into Confederate territory. The growing number of contrabands reaching federal lines necessitated the establishment of dozens of impromptu contraband camps. A draft map compiled by the National Park Service illustrates how the network of these generally transitory camps mirrored the advance of the Union Army along the Mississippi, Tennessee and Cumberland River systems. Grant's Army of the Tennessee spent the summer of 1862 protecting supply lines in western Tennessee and northern Mississippi. Victories at the Battle of Iuka in September and the Battle of Corinth in early October solidified Union control of the area.<\/p><p>Lincoln's announcement of the preliminary Emancipation Proclamation on Sept. 22, 1862, produced an even greater flood of refugees. How best to use and care for these contrabands proved particularly vexing for military leaders under Grant's command. \"You have no idea of the consternation Old Abe's Proclamation is making,\" wrote Gen. Grenville Dodge to his brother in September. The contrabands \"will not even wait until 1st January. I do not know what we shall do with them.\"<\/p><p>Many of these fugitives arrived in an appalling condition. \"There were men, women, and children in every stage of disease or decrepitude often nearly naked, with flesh torn by the terrible experiences of their escape,\" wrote one observer. \"Often the slaves met prejudices against their color more bitter than any they had left behind.\"<\/p><p>On Nov. 11, 1862, Grant took the first step toward addressing the crisis: he named John Eaton, a former high school principal and chaplain of the 27th Ohio Infantry, as superintendent of contrabands and set him at work \"organizing them into suitable companies for working.\" A month later he went further. \"The negroes will be clothed, and in every way provided for, out of their earnings\" \u2014 about 12.5 cents for each pound of cotton picked \u2014 \"so far as practicable,\" he ordered. \"In no case will negroes be forced into the service of the Government, or be enticed away from their homes except when it becomes a military necessity.\"<\/p><p>Grant's policies lent the contraband camps an official status and began to define what a freedman could and could not do once within the Union lines. Personally, Grant appears to have had no particular sympathy for the refugees. He seems to have recognized that, in the words of one observer, \"The soldiers of our army were a good deal opposed to serving the Negro in any manner.\" Nevertheless, the Union commander unreservedly supported Eaton's work and in the process enabled the creation of one of the war's most successful contraband camps, located at Corinth, Miss.<\/p><p>Although formally organized under the direction of General Dodge in early December 1862 and placed under the command of James M. Alexander, chaplain of the 66th Illinois, the Corinth camp likely came into existence as early as September. Initially housed in army tents no longer considered serviceable for Union troops, the freedmen were soon set to work downing trees and clearing land on which to build cabins and lay out streets, which were named for Union generals. Eventually the freedmen also built a four-room school, a commissary, a hospital, a church and an office. The entire camp was divided into wards, complete with ward masters and a police force.<\/p><p>In late 1862 the American Missionary Association sent its first volunteers to Corinth to help care for, educate and minister to the freedmen. In a memoir written years after the war, one such missionary recalled her experience. \"When brought face to face with the slaves,\" she wrote, \"it was like the discovery of a new race.\" The men and women who came to Corinth generally shared a paternalistic optimism and viewed the freedmen as childlike in their enthusiasm for both education and salvation.<\/p><p>The freedmen's thirst for knowledge was undeniable. \"You will find them every hour of daylight, at their books,\" observed the Rev. Edward Pierce in March of 1863. \"We cannot enter a cabin, or tent, but that we see from one to three with books.\" Within no time Pierce and his wife had more than 150 students, and by the end of the summer, the addition of more missionaries enabled the school to accommodate between 300 and 400 children as well as 60 adults at a night school. In August, one of the teachers estimated that as many as 1,000 freedmen had learned to read in the Corinth camp.<\/p><p>Organized religion followed closely on the heels of formal education. Reverend Olds \"saw an earnestness in reference to the Christian life that I have seldom seen. And as I saw their deep earnestness & heard their hearty responses,\" he said, \"I was led to ask where can we find a more impressible people than these?\"<\/p><p>The population of the camp fluctuated between 1,500 and 6,000, as large groups undertook assignments for the Union Army or contracted to work on local plantations. In March 1863, for example, the camp was home to 658 men, 1,440 women and 1,559 children. Among the men were 36 blacksmiths, 48 carpenters, 180 teamsters and 200 cooks. The female ranks included 80 seamstresses, 150 laundresses and 600 cooks. Two-thirds of the men and three-quarters of the women were married, and seven in eight women had children. According to John Eaton's records, the camp had experienced 900 cases of illness, 189 deaths and 45 births.<\/p><p>Life at Corinth changed dramatically after a May 1863 visit by Adj. Gen. Lorenzo Thomas, who was intent on recruiting thousands of contrabands for his newly formed black regiments. With the organization of the 1st Alabama Infantry of African Descent, later renamed the 55th United States Colored Troops, the camp lost most of its able-bodied men.<\/p><p>Their departure to fight left only the women, the young, the old and the infirm to carry on Eaton's ambitious agricultural program, which rested on the cooperative farming of large tracts of abandoned and confiscated land. The program put 400 acres under cultivation, 300 for cotton and 100 for vegetables. Each cabin also had its own subsistence garden. By May 1863, the success of the agricultural program and the presence of a multitude of skilled artisans produced a clear monthly profit of $4,000 to $5,000 for the government, as well as an admirably independent community that Eaton hoped might serve as a model for other camps.<\/p><p>Unfortunately, the success of the Corinth camp proved short-lived. Plans for a winter campaign by Union forces in January 1864 provided a grim reminder that the fate of the freedmen was always secondary to the triumph of the Union cause. The order to relocate the camp's inhabitants 93 miles westward, to Memphis, \"fell like a bomb-shell among our contented people,\" lamented one missionary, \"but military orders are preemptory,\" and they \"must be obeyed.\" The freedmen left their \"well-organized village,\" gardens and farms to tdiv><\/p><p>The move from Corinth destroyed the spirit that had animated the freedmen's success. Some of the new refugees found work on confiscated plantations or in Memphis, but most lived in one of several camps surrounding the city.<\/p><p>\"The destruction of the Corinth camp,\" noted one historian, \"was one of the tragedies of the Civil War.\" Eaton's plan for large-scale cooperative farming fell victim to a bitter struggle between the War and Treasury departments over the leasing of plantations and was never implemented elsewhere. And no more than one or two other camps were able to replicate the strong civilian leadership, well-planned and policed living environment, and emphasis on education that made Corinth a success.<\/p><p>Had the government learned from the model fashioned in northern Mississippi between the fall of 1862 and early 1864, the newly freed slaves might well have enjoyed a far easier transition to life in postwar America.<\/p><p>Sources: Joseph E.

When the shoebox-shaped and nearly shoebox-size panini shop opened on Bedford Street 15 years ago, there was nothing quite like it in New York, a restaurant that kept things simple and kept prices low, serving flavorful food in a room that was just adorable enough that you could decide, midmeal, that maybe the two of you squeezed into the counter were there on a date, and not just grabbing a bite.<\/p><p>You have to fire up the Wayback Machine to better understand how 'ino helped change how this city eats. Fifteen years ago, New York was a bistro town. There was the old guard: Blue Ribbon, Le Gamin, Jules, Lucky Strike, Raoul's and a dozen others. Then in 1997, a newcomer opened in SoHo named Balthazar, which raised the stakes with its set direction and unlisted reservation line. Balthazar was white-hot: it had perfectly distressed mirrors, fresh and crusty bread, and although it was impossible to get a table unless you knew somebody who knew somebody, you could always go at midnight and eat at the bar.<\/p><p>Soon, New York was lousy with bistros. It was a good era if you wanted a kir, steak frites, escargot, fris\u00e9e lardon, profiteroles. Authenticity, or some version of it, was the point. Everybody was pressing butter into little ramekins to be served at room temperature, changing the paper covering the tablecloths before serving dessert.<\/p><p>Honestly, it was really fun. The restaurants were lively, intimate, sexy. So what if you could recite the menu before you set foot in the door? But if you were a young chef with a measure of vision and creativity, you were stuck either making onion soup and beet salad with goat cheese. Or you worked on the line executing the vision and creativity of an older chef in Midtown or TriBeCa. Prune hadn't yet opened. Neither had Diner. Brooklyn didn't have much of a food scene outside the restaurant row on Smith Street, which was anchored by Patois, a bistro. If you went to Williamsburg, it was to go to a party or to go dancing, not to eat. This was the landscape when Jason and Jennifer Denton opened 'ino on a quiet street in the West Village. The kitchen in the back was the size of a D.J. booth and used the technology of induction burners, which was novel at the time: it was a paninoteca that looked as if it belonged in New York rather than being shipped, tile by mirrored tile, from Milan.<\/p><p>The culinary vocabulary was Italian, but it wasn't sepia-toned and sentimental. Instead, there was a focus on ingredients at a time when, in New York at least, few people cared. It had simple food done well, and sometimes you encountered flavors that weren't lifted out of the songbook. I still have a 13-year-old memory of sharing a shredded duck sandwich with sweet relish, a combination that is about as authentically Italian as a functioning parliament. You could go to 'ino to get something familiar (prosciutto and cheese will never get old), but you could also try something new.<\/p><p>'Ino was a casual joint with integrity, an easygoing place where you could eat well as long as you didn't mind the wait. Today, we take this combination for granted, and expect all kitchens to put some effort into sourcing and display a little creativity no matter how limited the resources. That we do owes a little bit to 'ino.","60":"A worker sets up a polling station the morning of the GOP primary in Florida. Fewer voters than expected turned out.<\/p><p>Editor's note: John Avlon is a CNN contributor and senior political columnist for Newsweek and The Daily Beast. He is co-editor of the book \"Deadline Artists: America's Greatest Newspaper Columns.\"<\/p><p>(CNN) -- Beneath Rick Santorum's stunning three-state sweep on Tuesday stands another stubborn sign of dissatisfaction with the status quo: Republican turnout is down.<\/p><p>I'm talking embarrassingly, disturbingly, hey-don't-you-know-it's-an-election-year bad. It is a sign of a serious enthusiasm gap among the rank and file, and a particularly bad omen for Mitt Romney and the GOP in the general election.<\/p><p>Here's the tale of the tape, state by state, beginning with Tuesday night: Minnesota had just more than 47,000 people turn out for its caucuses this year -- four years ago it was nearly 63,000 -- and Romney came in first, not a distant third as he did Tuesday night. In Colorado, more than 70,000 people turned out for its caucus in 2008 -- but in 2012 it was 65,000. And Missouri -- even making a generous discount for the fact that this was an entirely symbolic contest -- had 232,000 people turn out, less than half the number who did four years ago.<\/p><p>Even with months of pre-primary hype and attention solely devoted to the Republican field, turnout in this election cycle essentially flat-lined. In Iowa, a little more than 121,000 people voted, compared with nearly 119,000 four years before, when action in the Democratic caucuses absorbed most of the attention.<\/p><p>In New Hampshire, the same dynamic applied -- 245,000 voters turned out in 2012, compared with 241,000 four years before, despite Republicans being the only game in town and independents making up 47% of the total turnout in 2012, according to CNN exit polls. Take out the independent voters and you've got a deep net decline.<\/p><p>Always proudly rebellious, South Carolina has been the great outlier in this election cycle. With Newt Gingrich making an all-out push for conservatives in a conservative state, turnout was up almost 150,000 over four years before.<\/p><p>But in Florida, the decline became unmistakable. Maybe it decreased because the Romney and Gingrich campaigns, plus super PACS, spent more than $18 million in the Sunshine State on TV ads, of which 93% were negative in the last week alone, according to the Campaign Media Analysis Group. After all, negative ads depress turnout. But after all the mud was thrown, 1.6 million people turned out in the nation's fourth largest state, which might sound impressive until you compare it with the nearly 2 million who turned out in 2008.<\/p><p>Nevada was even worse, with 32,894 people turning out to vote in a state with more than 465,000 registered Republicans. Four years before, more than 44,300 participated in the caucus. Turnout was down more than 25% despite the GOP caucuses being the only game in town. Party officials were expecting a turnout of more than 70,000.<\/p><p>All this should be a wake-up call for the GOP. Despite an enormous amount of national media attention devoted to each of the states to date, the response has been a notable yawn among the Republican rank and file.<\/p><p>The turnout numbers are even worse when you compare them with the number of registered Republicans in each state that has voted to date.<\/p><p>The caucuses in particular bring out an unrepresentative sample of a state's Republican Party. For all the grass-roots romanticism, there has got to be a better way to pick a presidential nominee.<\/p><p>But the news is worst for Romney, long the presumptive front-runner in a party that tends to reward the man next in line.<\/p><p>\"Reluctantly Romney\" could be a bumper sticker, even for his supporters. The former Massachusetts governor has found it difficult to climb above 35% in national polls, meaning that a majority of Republicans still support someone else in a notably weak field. His vote margins and totals lag behind those of four years before, when he lost the nomination to John McCain in a crowded and comparatively competent field, although Minnesota is the first state he won in '08 and lost in 2012.<\/p><p>You reap what you sow, and part of the reason turnout is down is directly related to the problem of polarization. The Republican Party is more ideologically polarized than at any time in recent history. Therefore, it put up more purely right-wing candidates than it did four years before, when center-right leaders such as McCain and Rudy Giuliani were also in the race. A bigger tent inspired bigger turnout.<\/p><p>But the other reason is simple dissatisfaction with the candidates.<\/p><p>Republicans seem united in their anger against the president -- like the Democrats in 2004 -- but they are uninspired by their options. Draft movements for fantasy candidates ranging from Chris Christie to Mitch Daniels to Paul Ryan and even Jeb Bush have started and failed. Some party leaders show more enthusiasm for a hypothetical 2016 crop of candidates, including Marco Rubio and Bobby Jindal, than they do for the flawed choices before them in this election. Divided and dispirited is an odd place for the Republican Party to be so soon after the enthusiasms of the 2010 tea party-driven election.<\/p><p>The bottom line is that voter turnout matters. And what should be most troubling for Republicans is that this enthusiasm gap among the conservative base is accompanied by a lack of candidates who might appeal to independents and centrist swing voters in the general election. It is a double barrel of bad news for the Republican Party. The numbers can be spun and rationalized by professional partisan operatives all day long, but the fact remains -- voters just aren't turning out to cast their votes for this crop of conservative candidates in 2012.<\/p><p>Follow CNN Opinion on Twitter.<\/p><p>Join the conversation on Facebook.<\/p><p>The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John Avlon.","61":"The Coworking Resources Series is supported by join.me.

It's been nearly two decades since pictures of this sort were produced with any regularity by the studio system, and a lot longer since they were stateside successes. Many of the attempts in recent years have been, at best, mid-budget passion projects with circumscribed audiences (Stallone's own<\/p><p>which topped out at $42 million domestically) or post-modern winks (the French-language \"JCVD\" from 2008, a hostage movie in which Jean-Claude Van Damme plays a version of himself). The few large-scale attempts, like \"The A-Team,\" underperformed. (The biceps-and-bullets remake grossed $77 million domestically, a number that will likely be easily surpassed by \"The Expendables.\")<\/p><p>But the Stallone picture -- with its hard-charging, take-no-prisoners patriotism unbothered by the vagaries of the real world (it takes place in a fictional country, for starters) and its caricature of freedom-hating enemies (\"We will kill this American disease,\" as the TV spot enticed us) -- planted itself squarely in the old-school genre. And this weekend, the movie showed that there's life in that category yet. That \"Scott Pilgrim vs. the World,\" the tongue-in-cheek, pop-culture-referential, decidedly 2010 creation -- the one for, of and by arch fanboys -- trailed well behind \"The Expendables\" only drove home the point more loudly.<\/p><p>On one hand, it's understandable that a movie of easy American heroism (OK, first-world Western heroism) would catch on. In fact, it's surprising it didn't happen sooner. Apple-pie-patriotism already is behind the success of a cable news network and supports large sections of the contemporary country music industry. Why not a film hit too?<\/p><p>But among all the factors to which one might point in explaining the success of \"The Expendables\" -- a cast harvested from so many demographics and eras; a moviegoer backlash to 3-D and CG effects -- it somehow doesn't feel that the demand for neat heroes and villains is one of them.<\/p><p>Norris and his ilk would submit that in our current period of ideological and geopolitical upheaval, in a time of blurry lines between enemies and friends in places such as Afghanistan and Iraq, that black-and-white heroes slake a patriotic thirst (and that, indeed, the movie-going world can support a lot more of them). But history argues the opposite: Those movies succeed when the culture at large is filled with clear-cut distinctions. On the other hand, when the zeitgeist is more cloudy, an entirely different kind of cinema prospers.<\/p><p>The post-WWII era and its mainly straightforward distinctions between good and evil, to take an example of the former, yielded a flowering subgenre of movies with morally uncomplicated gunslingers. And 30 years later, the ideological simplicity of the Cold War and its larger-than-life Evil Empire gave rise to the very action movies on which \"Expendables\" is modeled (not to mention the ultimate in us-versus-them confections, \"Rocky IV.\" Yes, there's a Stallone-ishness to all of this). There are plenty of reasons why these types of movies faded from view in the 1990s, but the fall of the Berlin Wall and the the Soviet Union certainly played a part.<\/p><p>The examples are just as abundant on the other side. The ambiguities of the Vietnam War and the counterculture in the late 1960s and early 1970s undoubtedly offered up the moral murkiness of<\/p><p>\"Midnight Cowboy\" and scores of others. In the post-9\/11 world, meanwhile, movies like<\/p><p>-- with its themes of a destruction-bent enemy that can't be bargained with, and the question of what constitutes an acceptable ethical compromise in fighting that enemy -- have captured our imagination. You can throw<\/p><p>in there too, to the degree the movie was a contemplation of Western interests in the Middle East.<\/p><p>Political eras are, of course, rarely just one thing or another, and the movies we want to see in a given period are hardly monolithic. But as tempting as it is to infer that the success of \"The Expendables\" shows a deeper cultural need, it may well be the wrong inference. When times are confusing, we want movies to reflect that confusion, and even to make sense of it. But we probably don't want to pretend that confusion doesn't exist.<\/p><p>Photo: A scene from \"The Expendables.\" Credit: Lionsgate<\/p><p>Stallone: I'm contemplating an \"Expendables\" sequel<\/p><p>Hollywood wonders if Schwarzenegger will be back","64":"Now that Newt Gingrich has vaulted into the lead in the Republican presidential stakes, he's going to be seeing a lot more of this:<\/p><p>Calling it the \"dumbest thing\" he has done in recent years isn't enough. This is not going away.<\/p><p>But, Newt can turn his pas-de-deux on the loveseat with Nancy into an opportunity to promote a consistent and electable political message.<\/p><p>Because he will be asked about this at every turn, Newt will have the air time and the opportunity to tell the truth on climate change\u2014based upon real science\u2014and to interface it with a limited-government philosophy. The two are easy to do.<\/p><p>Start with the obvious. Instead of waffling on the subject, he could just point out that earth's surface temperature is about 1\u00b0C warmer than it was a century ago. There were two periods of warming, the first from about 1910 through 1945, and the second from the mid-1970s to the late-1990s. They were both roughly the same magnitude. Because the first one was long before we put the majority of fossil carbon into the atmosphere, Newt can say\u2014with scientific authority\u2014that the magnitude of 'natural' climate change is likely to be at least as large as what humans have done.<\/p><p>Then Newt should proceed to the future. It's not the heat, it's the sensitivity. How much it will warm in the future is a function of how sensitive the atmosphere is to doubling atmospheric carbon dioxide. There are a number of independent arguments now coming together showing that this value may have been overestimated. The reference for the most recent is a November issue of Science.<\/p><p>Next, a little refreshing honesty: in 2009, the House of Representatives passed a cap-and-trade bill (which the Senate did not) commanding that the average american\u201438 years from now\u2014be allowed the carbon dioxide emissions of the average citizen in 1867. Prior to its passage, Newt was undeniably for such a system. Newt could call that that the \"second dumbest thing\" he has done and be finished with it.<\/p><p>After setting the record straight, how about interjecting his own political philosophy? When asked what to do about global warming, he should give the honest answer: if the atmosphere indeed is not as sensitive to carbon dioxide changes as previously thought, the correct response is nothing.<\/p><p>That's because \"nothing\" really means something. Newt should channel his historian. When markets are free, capital supports innovation more efficiently than when they aren't. Think about the remarkable changes in energy and technology in the last 100 years. Isn't it rather obvious that the same will occur in the next century, if only we don't hinder capital development? Newt might even use the catchy saw (first sloganed by Northern Illinois Gas in 1972) the future belongs to the efficient, and that there are impressive market forces that advantage those who produce things efficiently or produce efficient things.<\/p><p>When the doomsayers say Newt is believing in a Deus ex machine to dramatically cut carbon dioxide emissions, he might point out that those were the same folks who, only a very few years ago, told us we were running out of natural gas. Innovation and capital revolutionized drilling and fracturing shale, and we now know we have literally hundreds of years of it under our feet. There are a lot more voters and delegates around the country who will benefit from the shale revolution than there are in ethanol-addicted Iowa.","65":"MADRID (AP) \u2013 Spain's grinding economic misery will get worse this year despite the country's request for a European financial lifeline of up to $125 billion to save its banks, Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said Sunday.<\/p><p>A day after the country conceded it needed outside help following months of denying it would seek assistance, Rajoy said more Spaniards will lose their jobs in a country where one out of every four are already unemployed.<\/p><p>\"This year is going to be a bad one,\" Rajoy said Sunday in his first comments about the rescue since it was announced the previous evening by his economy minister.<\/p><p>The conservative prime minister added that the economy, stuck in its second recession in three years, will still contract the previously predicted 1.7 percent even with the help. Small businesses and families starving for credit will eventually get relief as the funding props up banks and they increase lending, but Rajoy didn't offer guidance on when.<\/p><p>Spain on Saturday became the fourth \u2014 and largest \u2014 of the 17 countries that use Europe's common currency to request a bailout \u2014 a big blow to a nation that a few years ago took pride as the continent's economic superstar only to see it become the hot spot in the eurozone debt crisis. Its economy is the eurozone's fourth largest after Germany, France and Italy.<\/p><p>Across the country, Spaniards reacted with a mixture of anger and relief to the news. The amount of the rescue fund, if all is tapped, amounts to \u20ac21,000 of new debt for each person in the nation of 47 million where the average annual salary for those with work is about the same amount and the unemployment rate for those under age 25 is 52 percent.<\/p><p>The country is already reeling from deep austerity cuts Rajoy has imposed over the last six months that have raised taxes, made it easier to hire and fire workers, and cut deep into cherished government programs including education and national health care.<\/p><p>\"It's obviously a shame,\" said civil servant Luisa Saraguren, 44, as she strolled on a sunny Sunday morning with her young daughter. \"But this bailout was fully predictable, and the consequences of this help are going to be a lot bigger compared to the cuts we've been living with already.\"<\/p><p>Rajoy took pains to avoid the word bailout Sunday, saying Spain's rescue package is a line of credit that its most troubled banks will be able to tap. The assistance will not come with the outside control over government macroeconomic policy like that imposed Greece, Ireland and Portugal when their public finances were bailed out.<\/p><p>He said interest rates on the loans will be considerably lower than the rate near 7 percent that Spain has been forced to pay recently on the international debt markets, a level that forced the other countries to seek bailouts.<\/p><p>Spain will regain the economic credibility it has lost by shoring up its banks, which will result in credit being restored so businesses and individuals shut off from loans can start borrowing and the economy will grow again, Rajoy insisted, again without saying when.<\/p><p>Europe's widening recession and financial crisis has hurt companies and investors around the world. Providing a financial lifeline to Spanish banks is likely to relieve anxiety on the Spanish economy \u2014 which is five times larger than Greece's \u2014 and on markets concerned about the country's ability to pay its way.<\/p><p>Spain's financial problems are not due to Greek-style government over-spending. The country's banks particularly its savings banks or \"cajas,\" got caught up in the collapse of a real estate bubble in 2008 that got worse over the past four years. However, as Spain's leaders have struggled for a solution to their banking crisis, the country's borrowing costs have soared close to the level that forced the governments of Greece, Portugal and Ireland to seek rescues.<\/p><p>Some of Spain's banks are struggling with by toxic real estate loans and assets amid fears the problem will get worse as more jobless people can't pay their mortgages. The Bank of Spain says the toxic loans and assets total around \u20ac180 billion. Nationalized lender Bankia SA, which has requested \u20ac19 billion in aid, has \u20ac32 billion in toxic assets. Around four other banks serving the domestic market are considered prime candidates for bailouts.<\/p><p>\"I could never get my mind round the scale of consumption in Spain over the past 20 years, having known it in the 1960s when it was still extremely poor,\" said Paul Preston, a history professor and expert on Spain with the London School of Economics. \"Lots of people enjoyed the consumer boom, but not everybody. Now everybody's having to pay for it.\"<\/p><p>Rajoy blamed Spain's woes on the previous Socialist administration of Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero without mentioning him or his government by name. Zapatero was ousted by Rajoy in a landslide last November by voters outraged over the Socialist handling of the economy.<\/p><p>\"Last year Spain's public administration spent \u20ac90 billion more than it took in, this can't be maintained, we can't live like that,\" Rajoy said.<\/p><p>But Socialist Party leader Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba said Rajoy should acknowledge that Spain is now in bailout territory.<\/p><p>\"The government is trying to make us believe that we've won the lottery, that the Three Kings of Orient have arrived, and that isn't so,\" Rubalcaba said.<\/p><p>After his press conference, Rajoy defended his decision to jet off an hour later to Poland to see Spain's famed national football team take on Italy in the Euro 2012 competition. He said he would be on the ground in Gdansk only for the game before flying back to Madrid Sunday night.<\/p><p>\"I'll be there two and a half hours and then I'll leave,\" Rajoy said. \"I think the national team deserves it.\"","66":"Disunion follows the Civil War as it unfolded.<\/p><p>The Lincoln administration may not have gone to war in 1861 to end slavery, but no one bothered to tell that to the slaves. Within six weeks of the firing on Fort Sumter, Gen. Benjamin Butler was forced to decide what to do with three slaves who escaped to Fortress Monroe on the north shore of Virginia's James River. Butler, certainly no abolitionist, nonetheless refused to return the three to their owner, labeling them \"contrabands of war.\"<\/p><p>The term, suitably ambiguous for an administration that as yet had no policy on how to handle the fugitives, found immediate acceptance. As one Union officer wrote, \"Never was a word so speedily adopted by so many people in so short a time.\" Within weeks hundreds of \"contrabands\" \u2014 men, women and children \u2014 flocked to Fortress Monroe and other Union Army positions. Unsure what might greet them, the escaped slaves were yet confident that life under federal control must surely represent an improvement.<\/p><p>It took the federal government more than a year to devise a policy in answer to this thirst for freedom. In August 1861, the First Confiscation Act stripped slaveholders of their claim of ownership, but it failed to clarify whether the slaves were themselves free. The following March Congress prohibited the military from sending escaped slaves back into slavery, and in July the Second Confiscation Act decreed that all slaves that took refuge in Union areas were \"captives of war\" and would be set free.<\/p><p>These legislative actions took on ever greater significance as Union forces moved deeper and deeper into Confederate territory. The growing number of contrabands reaching federal lines necessitated the establishment of dozens of impromptu contraband camps. A draft map compiled by the National Park Service illustrates how the network of these generally transitory camps mirrored the advance of the Union Army along the Mississippi, Tennessee and Cumberland River systems. Grant's Army of the Tennessee spent the summer of 1862 protecting supply lines in western Tennessee and northern Mississippi. Victories at the Battle of Iuka in September and the Battle of Corinth in early October solidified Union control of the area.<\/p><p>Lincoln's announcement of the preliminary Emancipation Proclamation on Sept. 22, 1862, produced an even greater flood of refugees. How best to use and care for these contrabands proved particularly vexing for military leaders under Grant's command. \"You have no idea of the consternation Old Abe's Proclamation is making,\" wrote Gen. Grenville Dodge to his brother in September. The contrabands \"will not even wait until 1st January. I do not know what we shall do with them.\"<\/p><p>Many of these fugitives arrived in an appalling condition. \"There were men, women, and children in every stage of disease or decrepitude often nearly naked, with flesh torn by the terrible experiences of their escape,\" wrote one observer. \"Often the slaves met prejudices against their color more bitter than any they had left behind.\"<\/p><p>On Nov. 11, 1862, Grant took the first step toward addressing the crisis: he named John Eaton, a former high school principal and chaplain of the 27th Ohio Infantry, as superintendent of contrabands and set him at work \"organizing them into suitable companies for working.\" A month later he went further. \"The negroes will be clothed, and in every way provided for, out of their earnings\" \u2014 about 12.5 cents for each pound of cotton picked \u2014 \"so far as practicable,\" he ordered. \"In no case will negroes be forced into the service of the Government, or be enticed away from their homes except when it becomes a military necessity.\"<\/p><p>Grant's policies lent the contraband camps an official status and began to define what a freedman could and could not do once within the Union lines. Personally, Grant appears to have had no particular sympathy for the refugees. He seems to have recognized that, in the words of one observer, \"The soldiers of our army were a good deal opposed to serving the Negro in any manner.\" Nevertheless, the Union commander unreservedly supported Eaton's work and in the process enabled the creation of one of the war's most successful contraband camps, located at Corinth, Miss.<\/p><p>Although formally organized under the direction of General Dodge in early December 1862 and placed under the command of James M. Alexander, chaplain of the 66th Illinois, the Corinth camp likely came into existence as early as September. Initially housed in army tents no longer considered serviceable for Union troops, the freedmen were soon set to work downing trees and clearing land on which to build cabins and lay out streets, which were named for Union generals. Eventually the freedmen also built a four-room school, a commissary, a hospital, a church and an office. The entire camp was divided into wards, complete with ward masters and a police force.<\/p><p>In late 1862 the American Missionary Association sent its first volunteers to Corinth to help care for, educate and minister to the freedmen. In a memoir written years after the war, one such missionary recalled her experience. \"When brought face to face with the slaves,\" she wrote, \"it was like the discovery of a new race.\" The men and women who came to Corinth generally shared a paternalistic optimism and viewed the freedmen as childlike in their enthusiasm for both education and salvation.<\/p><p>The freedmen's thirst for knowledge was undeniable. \"You will find them every hour of daylight, at their books,\" observed the Rev. Edward Pierce in March of 1863. \"We cannot enter a cabin, or tent, but that we see from one to three with books.\" Within no time Pierce and his wife had more than 150 students, and by the end of the summer, the addition of more missionaries enabled the school to accommodate between 300 and 400 children as well as 60 adults at a night school. In August, one of the teachers estimated that as many as 1,000 freedmen had learned to read in the Corinth camp.<\/p><p>Organized religion followed closely on the heels of formal education. Reverend Olds \"saw an earnestness in reference to the Christian life that I have seldom seen. And as I saw their deep earnestness & heard their hearty responses,\" he said, \"I was led to ask where can we find a more impressible people than these?\"<\/p><p>The population of the camp fluctuated between 1,500 and 6,000, as large groups undertook assignments for the Union Army or contracted to work on local plantations. In March 1863, for example, the camp was home to 658 men, 1,440 women and 1,559 children. Among the men were 36 blacksmiths, 48 carpenters, 180 teamsters and 200 cooks. The female ranks included 80 seamstresses, 150 laundresses and 600 cooks. Two-thirds of the men and three-quarters of the women were married, and seven in eight women had children. According to John Eaton's records, the camp had experienced 900 cases of illness, 189 deaths and 45 births.<\/p><p>Life at Corinth changed dramatically after a May 1863 visit by Adj. Gen. Lorenzo Thomas, who was intent on recruiting thousands of contrabands for his newly formed black regiments. With the organization of the 1st Alabama Infantry of African Descent, later renamed the 55th United States Colored Troops, the camp lost most of its able-bodied men.<\/p><p>Their departure to fight left only the women, the young, the old and the infirm to carry on Eaton's ambitious agricultural program, which rested on the cooperative farming of large tracts of abandoned and confiscated land. The program put 400 acres under cultivation, 300 for cotton and 100 for vegetables. Each cabin also had its own subsistence garden. By May 1863, the success of the agricultural program and the presence of a multitude of skilled artisans produced a clear monthly profit of $4,000 to $5,000 for the government, as well as an admirably independent community that Eaton hoped might serve as a model for other camps.<\/p><p>Unfortunately, the success of the Corinth camp proved short-lived. Plans for a winter campaign by Union forces in January 1864 provided a grim reminder that the fate of the freedmen was always secondary to the triumph of the Union cause. The order to relocate the camp's inhabitants 93 miles westward, to Memphis, \"fell like a bomb-shell among our contented people,\" lamented one missionary, \"but military orders are preemptory,\" and they \"must be obeyed.\" The freedmen left their \"well-organized village,\" gardens and farms to tdiv><\/p><p>The move from Corinth destroyed the spirit that had animated the freedmen's success. Some of the new refugees found work on confiscated plantations or in Memphis, but most lived in one of several camps surrounding the city.<\/p><p>\"The destruction of the Corinth camp,\" noted one historian, \"was one of the tragedies of the Civil War.\" Eaton's plan for large-scale cooperative farming fell victim to a bitter struggle between the War and Treasury departments over the leasing of plantations and was never implemented elsewhere. And no more than one or two other camps were able to replicate the strong civilian leadership, well-planned and policed living environment, and emphasis on education that made Corinth a success.<\/p><p>Had the government learned from the model fashioned in northern Mississippi between the fall of 1862 and early 1864, the newly freed slaves might well have enjoyed a far easier transition to life in postwar America.<\/p><p>Sources: Joseph E.

With Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, Connie Nielsen, Oliver Reed. Directed by Ridley Scott. At area theaters. Running time: 154 mins. Rated R: Gory violence, incest theme. 3 1\/2 Stars.<\/p><p>If there's a soft spot in your heart for the sword-&-sandal epic - and from the star rating above, I think you can guess where I stand - then you'll swoon with giddy delight over \"Gladiator,\" a sweaty, stylish hunkfest that takes you back to the days of \"Ben-Hur,\" \"Spartacus\" and the so recently departed Steve Reeves.<\/p><p>From his biceps to his gluteus, Maximus is maximus. This Roman general turned slave turned gladiator hasn't a shred of humor, but then, he doesn't have time for idle nonsense when he's lopping off heads all day. (The head-lopping is apparently his signature, like the mark of Zorro.)<\/p><p>In director Ridley Scott's thrilling, burnished epic, Maximus no sooner serves the empire by leveling Germania during a snowstorm than Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) tosses him a promotion he doesn't want - to succeed the aged emperor and whip Rome back into shape. All Maximus wants is to go home to his wife and child in the suburbs.<\/p><p>The careworn Russell Crowe is physically and temperamentally perfect for the part of Maximus. Still carrying some of the weight he packed on for \"The Insider,\" he's no gym-toned pretty boy. He's solid, beefy, rough-hewn, creaking along in his heavy leather costume, with a look on his puss of weary disdain.<\/p><p>What makes him sexy is his sense of honor and loyalty: \"What we do in life echoes in eternity!\" Anyway, it can't be his hygiene, although he is frequently bathed in a sanctifying golden glow.<\/p><p>After a coup by the emperor's weak-kneed son, Commodus (a whiny, surprisingly fleshy Joaquin Phoenix), Maximus' fortunes change. He winds up being thrown to the tigers, two shows daily, in Rome's Colosseum, the entertainment complex of its day.<\/p><p>Crowe, like his character, must grimly come to terms with the fact that, actor or gladiator, it's all about showmanship. Give the crowd what it wants, either at the multiplex or in the arena, and you can write your own ticket.<\/p><p>\"I have power only to amuse the mob,\" he spits contemptuously like a Shakespearean actor reduced to dinner theater.<\/p><p>The plot, about avenging honor, provides brief respite between an array of hand-to-hand battles that are pitched so furiously that individual components barely register; they're subliminal suggestions of computer-assisted carnage, with Jackson Pollock sprays of blood. For fans of the genre, yes, this is a good thing.<\/p><p>Connie Nielsen plays Commodus' sister and possible love interest for Maximus once his family is dispatched (politics, you know). Nielsen's costumes are laced up like bondage gear, and there is a tantalizing hint of romance past.<\/p><p>But the camera only has eyes for Crowe. The glowering! The seething! The hooded gaze! The quiet suffering! (Watch him carve away a tattoo he no longer has use for. No anesthetic! No disinfectant!)<\/p><p>The supporting cast makes for a gauntlet of worthy friends and adversaries, all of them thinkers, including Derek Jacobi (\"I, Claudius\") as a senator, Djimon Hounsou (\"Amistad\") as a fellow gladiator and Oliver Reed, who died with two days to go on the shoot, looking a little woozy as a gladiator entrepreneur.<\/p><p>Reed's character is the one most in touch with the movie's premise - that entertainment is the goal, and a worthy one at that.","68":"Tim Burrack, a northern Iowa farmer in his 44th growing season, has taken to keeping a wary eye out for unfamiliar vehicles around his 300 acres of genetically modified corn seeds.<\/p><p>Along with other farmers in this vast agricultural region, he has upped his vigilance ever since Mo Hailong and six other Chinese nationals were accused by U.S. authorities in 2013 of digging up seeds from Iowa farms and planning to send them back to China.<\/p><p>The case, in which Mo pleaded guilty in January, has laid bare the value\u2014and vulnerability\u2014of advanced food technology in a world with 7 billion mouths to feed, 1.36 billion of them Chinese.<\/p><p>Citing that case and others as evidence of a growing economic and national security threat to America's farm sector, U.S. law enforcement officials are urging agriculture executives and security officers to increase their vigilance and report any suspicious activity.<\/p><p>But on a March 30 visit to Iowa, Justice Department officials could offer little advice to ensure against similar thefts, underlining how agricultural technology lying in open fields can be more vulnerable than a computer network or a factory floor.<\/p><p>\"It may range down to traditional barriers like a fence and doing human patrols to making sure you get good visuals on what's occurring,\" Assistant Attorney General John Carlin, head of the Justice Department's national security division, said when touring Iowa State University.<\/p><p>But agriculture sector executives say fences and guards are not feasible, due to the high cost and impracticality of guarding hundreds of thousands of acres.<\/p><p>Tom McBride, intellectual property attorney at Monsanto\u2014one of the firms whose seeds were targeted by Mo\u2014said it safeguards its genetically modified organism (GMO) technology by protecting its computers, patenting seeds and keeping fields like Burrack's unmarked.

Over the past two years, U.S. companies, government research facilities and universities have all been targeted, according to the FBI.<\/p><p>Although prosecutors were unable to establish a Chinese government link to Mo's group, the case adds to U.S.-China frictions over what Washington says is increasing economic espionage and trade secret theft by Beijing and its proxies.<\/p><p>A U.S. law enforcement official told Reuters the agency looked for a connection between the Chinese government and the conspiracy carried out by Mo.<\/p><p>\"In cases like this, we can see connections, but proving to the threshold needed in court requires that we have documents that the government has directed this,\" the official said. \"It's almost impossible to get.\"<\/p><p>A Chinese embassy spokesman in Washington, Zhu Haiquan, said he did not have detailed information on the Mo case but that China \"stands firm\" on the protection of intellectual property and maintains \"constant communication and cooperation\" with the U.S. government on the issue.<\/p><p>On his visit to Washington last September, President Xi Jinping reiterated China's denial of any government role in the hacking of U.S. corporate secrets.<\/p><p>Mo, an employee of Chinese firm Kings Nower Seed, pleaded guilty to stealing seed grown by U.S. firms Monsanto, Dupont Pioneer dd and LG Seeds.<\/p><p>Prosecutors say he specifically targeted fields that grow the parent seeds needed to replicate GMO corn.

The majority of cases reported involve Chinese nationals, the U.S. law enforcement official told Reuters. In the agriculture sector, organic insecticide, irrigation equipment and rice, along with corn, are all suspected to have been targeted, including by Chinese nationals, the official said.<\/p><p>Mo Hongjian, vice president of Kings Nower Seed's parent company, Beijing Dabeinong Technology Group, declined to comment on the case or on the company's connection with the Chinese government.<\/p><p>The parent firm is privately owned, but says it receives government money for research in \"science and technology.\"<\/p><p>China bans commercial growing of GMO grains due to public opposition to the technology and imports of GMO corn have to be approved by the agriculture ministry. Still, President Xi called in 2014 for China to innovate and dominate the technique, which promises high yields through resistance to drought, pests and disease.<\/p><p>In January, a Greenpeace report found some Chinese farmers are illegally growing GMO corn whose strains belong to companies including Monsanto, Syngenta syt and DuPont Pioneer.<\/p><p>Monsanto, which supplies Burrack's seed, said it can block foreign groups who request to tour their lab and learning center in Huxley, Iowa.

We're beginning to set the stage for the grand bargain.\"<\/p><p>Among the highlights of the president's plan is spending cuts and tax increases that would reduce the deficit by $1.8 trillion over 10 years, replacing the $1.2 trillion in automatic spending cuts, known as sequester, over the same period.<\/p><p>The proposal also is expected to include new spending for public works projects, early education and job training, as well as $580 billion in new taxes that Republicans oppose.<\/p><p>Counting reductions and higher taxes that Congress and Obama have approved since 2011, the 2014 budget would contribute $4.3 trillion to total deficit reduction by 2023.<\/p><p>On Saturday, the president said his budget was not his \"ideal plan,\" but it was a compromise that he would be willing to accept.<\/p><p>The House and Senate have already passed their own budget plans.

Recently, the Los Angeles based-comedian started working one very personal, serious experience into her routine.<\/p><p>on Monday to open up about a violent relationship with an ex boyfriend, sharing photos of her bruised arms and legs and explaining why she has decided to include discussions of the abuse in her stand-up.<\/p><p>\"Same girl in all of these photos (me). I've had an amazing year, and you've seen the highlights here, so these photos are an uncommon thing to share but not an uncommon issue,\" Stelling captions a collage of photos of her bruises and her onstage smile.<\/p><p>The comic, who released her album<\/p><p>this fall and has a Comedy Central special, was hesitant to openly talk about the abuse, especially within her professional world.<\/p><p>\"There are many reasons not to make an abusive relationship public, mostly fear. Scared of what people will think, scared it makes me look weak or unprofessional,\" she writes.<\/p><p>\"When friends or comics ask why we broke up, it's not easy or comfortable to reply; it doesn't seem like the appropriate thing to say at a stand-up show, a party or a wedding. It's embarrassing. I feel stupid. After being verbally, physically abused and raped, I dated him for two more months.

And I abided. I wrote vague jokes because we both live in L.A., and I didn't want to hurt him, start a war, press charges, be interrogated or harassed by him or his friends and family. I wanted to move on and forget because I didn't understand,\" Stelling shares.<\/p><p>\"I don't want revenge or to hurt him now, but it's unhealthy to keep this inside because my stand-up is pulled directly from my life.

Fewer voters than expected turned out.<\/p><p>Editor's note: John Avlon is a CNN contributor and senior political columnist for Newsweek and The Daily Beast. He is co-editor of the book \"Deadline Artists: America's Greatest Newspaper Columns.\"<\/p><p>(CNN) -- Beneath Rick Santorum's stunning three-state sweep on Tuesday stands another stubborn sign of dissatisfaction with the status quo: Republican turnout is down.<\/p><p>I'm talking embarrassingly, disturbingly, hey-don't-you-know-it's-an-election-year bad. It is a sign of a serious enthusiasm gap among the rank and file, and a particularly bad omen for Mitt Romney and the GOP in the general election.<\/p><p>Here's the tale of the tape, state by state, beginning with Tuesday night: Minnesota had just more than 47,000 people turn out for its caucuses this year -- four years ago it was nearly 63,000 -- and Romney came in first, not a distant third as he did Tuesday night. In Colorado, more than 70,000 people turned out for its caucus in 2008 -- but in 2012 it was 65,000. And Missouri -- even making a generous discount for the fact that this was an entirely symbolic contest -- had 232,000 people turn out, less than half the number who did four years ago.<\/p><p>Even with months of pre-primary hype and attention solely devoted to the Republican field, turnout in this election cycle essentially flat-lined. In Iowa, a little more than 121,000 people voted, compared with nearly 119,000 four years before, when action in the Democratic caucuses absorbed most of the attention.<\/p><p>In New Hampshire, the same dynamic applied -- 245,000 voters turned out in 2012, compared with 241,000 four years before, despite Republicans being the only game in town and independents making up 47% of the total turnout in 2012, according to CNN exit polls. Take out the independent voters and you've got a deep net decline.<\/p><p>Always proudly rebellious, South Carolina has been the great outlier in this election cycle. With Newt Gingrich making an all-out push for conservatives in a conservative state, turnout was up almost 150,000 over four years before.<\/p><p>But in Florida, the decline became unmistakable. Maybe it decreased because the Romney and Gingrich campaigns, plus super PACS, spent more than $18 million in the Sunshine State on TV ads, of which 93% were negative in the last week alone, according to the Campaign Media Analysis Group. After all, negative ads depress turnout. But after all the mud was thrown, 1.6 million people turned out in the nation's fourth largest state, which might sound impressive until you compare it with the nearly 2 million who turned out in 2008.<\/p><p>Nevada was even worse, with 32,894 people turning out to vote in a state with more than 465,000 registered Republicans. Four years before, more than 44,300 participated in the caucus. Turnout was down more than 25% despite the GOP caucuses being the only game in town. Party officials were expecting a turnout of more than 70,000.<\/p><p>All this should be a wake-up call for the GOP. Despite an enormous amount of national media attention devoted to each of the states to date, the response has been a notable yawn among the Republican rank and file.<\/p><p>The turnout numbers are even worse when you compare them with the number of registered Republicans in each state that has voted to date.<\/p><p>The caucuses in particular bring out an unrepresentative sample of a state's Republican Party. For all the grass-roots romanticism, there has got to be a better way to pick a presidential nominee.<\/p><p>But the news is worst for Romney, long the presumptive front-runner in a party that tends to reward the man next in line.<\/p><p>\"Reluctantly Romney\" could be a bumper sticker, even for his supporters. The former Massachusetts governor has found it difficult to climb above 35% in national polls, meaning that a majority of Republicans still support someone else in a notably weak field. His vote margins and totals lag behind those of four years before, when he lost the nomination to John McCain in a crowded and comparatively competent field, although Minnesota is the first state he won in '08 and lost in 2012.<\/p><p>You reap what you sow, and part of the reason turnout is down is directly related to the problem of polarization. The Republican Party is more ideologically polarized than at any time in recent history. Therefore, it put up more purely right-wing candidates than it did four years before, when center-right leaders such as McCain and Rudy Giuliani were also in the race. A bigger tent inspired bigger turnout.<\/p><p>But the other reason is simple dissatisfaction with the candidates.<\/p><p>Republicans seem united in their anger against the president -- like the Democrats in 2004 -- but they are uninspired by their options. Draft movements for fantasy candidates ranging from Chris Christie to Mitch Daniels to Paul Ryan and even Jeb Bush have started and failed. Some party leaders show more enthusiasm for a hypothetical 2016 crop of candidates, including Marco Rubio and Bobby Jindal, than they do for the flawed choices before them in this election. Divided and dispirited is an odd place for the Republican Party to be so soon after the enthusiasms of the 2010 tea party-driven election.<\/p><p>The bottom line is that voter turnout matters. And what should be most troubling for Republicans is that this enthusiasm gap among the conservative base is accompanied by a lack of candidates who might appeal to independents and centrist swing voters in the general election. It is a double barrel of bad news for the Republican Party. The numbers can be spun and rationalized by professional partisan operatives all day long, but the fact remains -- voters just aren't turning out to cast their votes for this crop of conservative candidates in 2012.<\/p><p>Follow CNN Opinion on Twitter.<\/p><p>Join the conversation on Facebook.<\/p><p>The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John Avlon.","73":"I think there's a real possibility that there's going to be a substantial realignment in the political scene in this country, especially if nothing is done to satisfy these dissatisfied people.<\/p><p>The Trump phenomenon is really a reflection of what happened in the referendum, to some extent, and so is Podemos and so is Syriza and so is the Front National in France.<\/p><p>Unless the western world can somehow or other satisfy large numbers of its people that it can run the economy and the country in a way which is in their interests, I think you are going to finish up with this discontent.<\/p><p>If we are going to save liberal democracy, it's very important that something is done to get it back on track again.","74":"9NEWS NSW State Politics reporter Chris O'Keefe has won a Walkley Award.

The president's push is part of a larger American effort to further isolate and increase pressure on Iran after accusing it of a plot to assassinate Saudi Arabia's ambassador to the United States.<\/p><p>If the United Nations' watchdog group agrees to publicize the evidence, including new data from recent months, it would almost certainly revive a debate that has been dormant during the Arab Spring about how aggressively the United States and its allies, including Israel, should move to halt Iran's suspected weapons program.<\/p><p>Over the longer term, several senior Obama administration officials said in interviews, they are mulling a ban on financial transactions with Iran's central bank \u2014 a move that has been opposed by China and other Asian nations. Also being considered is an expansion of the ban on the purchase of petroleum products sold by companies controlled by the country's elite military force, the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps.<\/p><p>The Revolutionary Guards are also believed to oversee the military side of the nuclear program, and they are the parent of the Quds Force, which Washington has accused of directing the assassination plot.<\/p><p>The proposed sanctions come as administration officials confront skepticism around the world about their allegations that Iran was behind the plot and limited options about what they can do \u2014 as well as growing pressure from Republicans and some Democrats in Congress to take tougher action against Iran, with the central bank and the oil industry high on lawmakers' lists.<\/p><p>All of the proposed sanctions carry with them considerable political and economic risks. Yukiya Amano, the cautious director general of the United Nations group, the International Atomic Energy Agency, talked publicly in September about publishing some of the most delicate data suggesting Iran worked on nuclear triggers and warheads. But officials who have spoken with him say he is concerned that his inspectors could be ejected from Iran, shutting the best, though narrow, window into its nuclear activities.<\/p><p>Similarly, China and Russia, among other major Iranian trading partners, have resisted further oil and financial sanctions, saying the goal of isolating Iran is a poor strategy. Even inside the Obama administration, some officials say they fear any crackdown on Iranian oil exports could drive up oil prices when the United States and European economies are weak. As one senior official put it, \"You don't want to tip the U.S. into a downturn just to punish the Iranians.\"<\/p><p>Senior administration officials, who would not speak publicly about internal negotiations over the sanctions, say no recommendation on acting against the central bank has gone to Mr. Obama, who vowed last week to make sure Iran would face the \"toughest sanctions\" for what he said was its role in the sensational scheme to hire a Mexican drug cartel to kill the Saudi envoy.<\/p><p>The decision to press the International Atomic Energy Agency was brewing even before the plot against the Saudi ambassador was discovered, but that discovery prompted the White House to pursue a full-court, public press of the agency to release the sensitive intelligence.<\/p><p>Officials familiar with the evidence say it creates extraordinarily uncomfortable questions for the Iranians to answer, but does not definitively point to the construction of a weapon. Instead, it details work on individual technologies essential for designing and detonating a nuclear device, including how to turn uranium into bomb fuel, how to cast conventional explosives in a shape that can set off a nuclear blast, and how to make detonators, generate neutrons to spur a chain reaction, measure detonation waves and make nose cones for missiles.<\/p><p>Tommy Vietor, the spokesman for the National Security Council, said Saturday that \"the United States believes that a comprehensive assessment would be invaluable for the international community in its consideration of Iran's nuclear program and what to do about it.\" Iran has declared that all of the documents suggesting work on how to create a weapon that could fit atop an Iranian missile are \"fabrications\" intended to justify an attack. The country has been the target of covert attacks, including the assassinations of some nuclear scientists and a computer worm that disabled some of Iran's nuclear centrifuges.<\/p><p>The Obama administration, since coming to office, has never publicly presented detailed evidence to back up its claim that Iran is driving toward a weapon or creating the technology to assemble one quickly, should it need it. But it has discussed the evidence widely with allies.<\/p><p>In part the administration has hesitated to discuss the evidence because, after the failure to find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq in 2003, any American evidence is considered suspect. Widespread questions about the plot against the Saudis last week underscored how deep those suspicions run.<\/p><p>But Iran is a different kind of case. Inspectors visit regularly, measuring Iran's output of uranium, including recent production of the material, enriched to 20 percent purity, that takes it far closer to the kind of fuel needed for a weapon. Iran said recently that it would produce more of the 20 percent enriched material than it needs for a small medical research reactor, which prompted new concerns that it is building a stockpile that could be converted to weapons use.","77":"NEW YORK -- Ruben Tejada thinks Chase Utley's late slide that broke his right leg was dirty.<\/p><p>Speaking about the play for the first time since Utley ended Tejada's season in Game 2 of the NL Division Series against the Los Angeles Dodgers, the Mets shortstop said he's no longer upset over it.<\/p><p>Using a blue cane adorned with a Mets logo giving to him by the team's owners, Tejada hung out with teammates in the dugout before Game 4 of the World Series.<\/p><p>He says he's come to terms with what happened, even though he never responded to the message Utley sent him through captain David Wright.

Its economy is the eurozone's fourth largest after Germany, France and Italy.<\/p><p>Across the country, Spaniards reacted with a mixture of anger and relief to the news. The amount of the rescue fund, if all is tapped, amounts to \u20ac21,000 of new debt for each person in the nation of 47 million where the average annual salary for those with work is about the same amount and the unemployment rate for those under age 25 is 52 percent.<\/p><p>The country is already reeling from deep austerity cuts Rajoy has imposed over the last six months that have raised taxes, made it easier to hire and fire workers, and cut deep into cherished government programs including education and national health care.<\/p><p>\"It's obviously a shame,\" said civil servant Luisa Saraguren, 44, as she strolled on a sunny Sunday morning with her young daughter. \"But this bailout was fully predictable, and the consequences of this help are going to be a lot bigger compared to the cuts we've been living with already.\"<\/p><p>Rajoy took pains to avoid the word bailout Sunday, saying Spain's rescue package is a line of credit that its most troubled banks will be able to tap. The assistance will not come with the outside control over government macroeconomic policy like that imposed Greece, Ireland and Portugal when their public finances were bailed out.<\/p><p>He said interest rates on the loans will be considerably lower than the rate near 7 percent that Spain has been forced to pay recently on the international debt markets, a level that forced the other countries to seek bailouts.<\/p><p>Spain will regain the economic credibility it has lost by shoring up its banks, which will result in credit being restored so businesses and individuals shut off from loans can start borrowing and the economy will grow again, Rajoy insisted, again without saying when.<\/p><p>Europe's widening recession and financial crisis has hurt companies and investors around the world. Providing a financial lifeline to Spanish banks is likely to relieve anxiety on the Spanish economy \u2014 which is five times larger than Greece's \u2014 and on markets concerned about the country's ability to pay its way.<\/p><p>Spain's financial problems are not due to Greek-style government over-spending. The country's banks particularly its savings banks or \"cajas,\" got caught up in the collapse of a real estate bubble in 2008 that got worse over the past four years. However, as Spain's leaders have struggled for a solution to their banking crisis, the country's borrowing costs have soared close to the level that forced the governments of Greece, Portugal and Ireland to seek rescues.<\/p><p>Some of Spain's banks are struggling with by toxic real estate loans and assets amid fears the problem will get worse as more jobless people can't pay their mortgages. The Bank of Spain says the toxic loans and assets total around \u20ac180 billion. Nationalized lender Bankia SA, which has requested \u20ac19 billion in aid, has \u20ac32 billion in toxic assets. Around four other banks serving the domestic market are considered prime candidates for bailouts.<\/p><p>\"I could never get my mind round the scale of consumption in Spain over the past 20 years, having known it in the 1960s when it was still extremely poor,\" said Paul Preston, a history professor and expert on Spain with the London School of Economics. \"Lots of people enjoyed the consumer boom, but not everybody. Now everybody's having to pay for it.\"<\/p><p>Rajoy blamed Spain's woes on the previous Socialist administration of Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero without mentioning him or his government by name. Zapatero was ousted by Rajoy in a landslide last November by voters outraged over the Socialist handling of the economy.<\/p><p>\"Last year Spain's public administration spent \u20ac90 billion more than it took in, this can't be maintained, we can't live like that,\" Rajoy said.<\/p><p>But Socialist Party leader Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba said Rajoy should acknowledge that Spain is now in bailout territory.<\/p><p>\"The government is trying to make us believe that we've won the lottery, that the Three Kings of Orient have arrived, and that isn't so,\" Rubalcaba said.<\/p><p>After his press conference, Rajoy defended his decision to jet off an hour later to Poland to see Spain's famed national football team take on Italy in the Euro 2012 competition. He said he would be on the ground in Gdansk only for the game before flying back to Madrid Sunday night.<\/p><p>\"I'll be there two and a half hours and then I'll leave,\" Rajoy said. \"I think the national team deserves it.\"","80":"A worker sets up a polling station the morning of the GOP primary in Florida. Fewer voters than expected turned out.<\/p><p>Editor's note: John Avlon is a CNN contributor and senior political columnist for Newsweek and The Daily Beast. He is co-editor of the book \"Deadline Artists: America's Greatest Newspaper Columns.\"<\/p><p>(CNN) -- Beneath Rick Santorum's stunning three-state sweep on Tuesday stands another stubborn sign of dissatisfaction with the status quo: Republican turnout is down.<\/p><p>I'm talking embarrassingly, disturbingly, hey-don't-you-know-it's-an-election-year bad. It is a sign of a serious enthusiasm gap among the rank and file, and a particularly bad omen for Mitt Romney and the GOP in the general election.<\/p><p>Here's the tale of the tape, state by state, beginning with Tuesday night: Minnesota had just more than 47,000 people turn out for its caucuses this year -- four years ago it was nearly 63,000 -- and Romney came in first, not a distant third as he did Tuesday night. In Colorado, more than 70,000 people turned out for its caucus in 2008 -- but in 2012 it was 65,000. And Missouri -- even making a generous discount for the fact that this was an entirely symbolic contest -- had 232,000 people turn out, less than half the number who did four years ago.<\/p><p>Even with months of pre-primary hype and attention solely devoted to the Republican field, turnout in this election cycle essentially flat-lined. In Iowa, a little more than 121,000 people voted, compared with nearly 119,000 four years before, when action in the Democratic caucuses absorbed most of the attention.<\/p><p>In New Hampshire, the same dynamic applied -- 245,000 voters turned out in 2012, compared with 241,000 four years before, despite Republicans being the only game in town and independents making up 47% of the total turnout in 2012, according to CNN exit polls. Take out the independent voters and you've got a deep net decline.<\/p><p>Always proudly rebellious, South Carolina has been the great outlier in this election cycle. With Newt Gingrich making an all-out push for conservatives in a conservative state, turnout was up almost 150,000 over four years before.<\/p><p>But in Florida, the decline became unmistakable. Maybe it decreased because the Romney and Gingrich campaigns, plus super PACS, spent more than $18 million in the Sunshine State on TV ads, of which 93% were negative in the last week alone, according to the Campaign Media Analysis Group. After all, negative ads depress turnout. But after all the mud was thrown, 1.6 million people turned out in the nation's fourth largest state, which might sound impressive until you compare it with the nearly 2 million who turned out in 2008.<\/p><p>Nevada was even worse, with 32,894 people turning out to vote in a state with more than 465,000 registered Republicans. Four years before, more than 44,300 participated in the caucus. Turnout was down more than 25% despite the GOP caucuses being the only game in town. Party officials were expecting a turnout of more than 70,000.<\/p><p>All this should be a wake-up call for the GOP. Despite an enormous amount of national media attention devoted to each of the states to date, the response has been a notable yawn among the Republican rank and file.<\/p><p>The turnout numbers are even worse when you compare them with the number of registered Republicans in each state that has voted to date.<\/p><p>The caucuses in particular bring out an unrepresentative sample of a state's Republican Party. For all the grass-roots romanticism, there has got to be a better way to pick a presidential nominee.<\/p><p>But the news is worst for Romney, long the presumptive front-runner in a party that tends to reward the man next in line.<\/p><p>\"Reluctantly Romney\" could be a bumper sticker, even for his supporters. The former Massachusetts governor has found it difficult to climb above 35% in national polls, meaning that a majority of Republicans still support someone else in a notably weak field. His vote margins and totals lag behind those of four years before, when he lost the nomination to John McCain in a crowded and comparatively competent field, although Minnesota is the first state he won in '08 and lost in 2012.<\/p><p>You reap what you sow, and part of the reason turnout is down is directly related to the problem of polarization. The Republican Party is more ideologically polarized than at any time in recent history. Therefore, it put up more purely right-wing candidates than it did four years before, when center-right leaders such as McCain and Rudy Giuliani were also in the race. A bigger tent inspired bigger turnout.<\/p><p>But the other reason is simple dissatisfaction with the candidates.<\/p><p>Republicans seem united in their anger against the president -- like the Democrats in 2004 -- but they are uninspired by their options. Draft movements for fantasy candidates ranging from Chris Christie to Mitch Daniels to Paul Ryan and even Jeb Bush have started and failed. Some party leaders show more enthusiasm for a hypothetical 2016 crop of candidates, including Marco Rubio and Bobby Jindal, than they do for the flawed choices before them in this election. Divided and dispirited is an odd place for the Republican Party to be so soon after the enthusiasms of the 2010 tea party-driven election.<\/p><p>The bottom line is that voter turnout matters. And what should be most troubling for Republicans is that this enthusiasm gap among the conservative base is accompanied by a lack of candidates who might appeal to independents and centrist swing voters in the general election. It is a double barrel of bad news for the Republican Party. The numbers can be spun and rationalized by professional partisan operatives all day long, but the fact remains -- voters just aren't turning out to cast their votes for this crop of conservative candidates in 2012.<\/p><p>Follow CNN Opinion on Twitter.<\/p><p>Join the conversation on Facebook.<\/p><p>The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John Avlon.","81":"Writer-director Richard Linklater has described his latest film, \"Everybody Wants Some!!,\" as a \"spiritual sequel\" to 1993's \"Dazed and Confused.\" That made my heart fibrillate a little, and maybe yours too.

This is not going away.<\/p><p>But, Newt can turn his pas-de-deux on the loveseat with Nancy into an opportunity to promote a consistent and electable political message.<\/p><p>Because he will be asked about this at every turn, Newt will have the air time and the opportunity to tell the truth on climate change\u2014based upon real science\u2014and to interface it with a limited-government philosophy. The two are easy to do.<\/p><p>Start with the obvious. Instead of waffling on the subject, he could just point out that earth's surface temperature is about 1\u00b0C warmer than it was a century ago. There were two periods of warming, the first from about 1910 through 1945, and the second from the mid-1970s to the late-1990s. They were both roughly the same magnitude. Because the first one was long before we put the majority of fossil carbon into the atmosphere, Newt can say\u2014with scientific authority\u2014that the magnitude of 'natural' climate change is likely to be at least as large as what humans have done.<\/p><p>Then Newt should proceed to the future. It's not the heat, it's the sensitivity. How much it will warm in the future is a function of how sensitive the atmosphere is to doubling atmospheric carbon dioxide. There are a number of independent arguments now coming together showing that this value may have been overestimated. The reference for the most recent is a November issue of Science.<\/p><p>Next, a little refreshing honesty: in 2009, the House of Representatives passed a cap-and-trade bill (which the Senate did not) commanding that the average american\u201438 years from now\u2014be allowed the carbon dioxide emissions of the average citizen in 1867. Prior to its passage, Newt was undeniably for such a system. Newt could call that that the \"second dumbest thing\" he has done and be finished with it.<\/p><p>After setting the record straight, how about interjecting his own political philosophy? When asked what to do about global warming, he should give the honest answer: if the atmosphere indeed is not as sensitive to carbon dioxide changes as previously thought, the correct response is nothing.<\/p><p>That's because \"nothing\" really means something. Newt should channel his historian. When markets are free, capital supports innovation more efficiently than when they aren't. Think about the remarkable changes in energy and technology in the last 100 years. Isn't it rather obvious that the same will occur in the next century, if only we don't hinder capital development? Newt might even use the catchy saw (first sloganed by Northern Illinois Gas in 1972) the future belongs to the efficient, and that there are impressive market forces that advantage those who produce things efficiently or produce efficient things.<\/p><p>When the doomsayers say Newt is believing in a Deus ex machine to dramatically cut carbon dioxide emissions, he might point out that those were the same folks who, only a very few years ago, told us we were running out of natural gas. Innovation and capital revolutionized drilling and fracturing shale, and we now know we have literally hundreds of years of it under our feet. There are a lot more voters and delegates around the country who will benefit from the shale revolution than there are in ethanol-addicted Iowa.","83":"Writer-director Richard Linklater has described his latest film, \"Everybody Wants Some!!,\" as a \"spiritual sequel\" to 1993's \"Dazed and Confused.\" That made my heart fibrillate a little, and maybe yours too.

She also served as curator and director of the Arlington Historical Museum and editor of the Cherrydale Citizens' Association newsletter.<\/p><p>Single-family homes, the Arlington public schools, access to bike trails and proximity to the District draw people to the neighborhood. Sometimes, though, they move in but stay only a few years. Finding a house in Cherrydale can involve the competitive process the Stahlbergs experienced.<\/p><p>About half a mile north of the Virginia Square and Ballston Metro stations on the Orange and Silver lines, Cherrydale has a variety of residences ranging from farmhouses to bungalows to Sears and Montgomery Ward kit homes with two to five or bedrooms or sometimes more. Many date from 1900 to 1930, though some of the older houses were purchased to be torn down and replaced with larger homes, including some built as recently as this year.<\/p><p>Living there: Cherrydale lies north of Interstate 66 and south of Lorcom Lane, stretching roughly from Utah Street on the west to the northward-curving interstate on the east. The Maywood neighborhood claims the eastern half of those boundaries north of Lee Highway, lending something of an arrowhead shape to Cherrydale. Since 1908, the Cherrydale Citizens' Association has planned activities and resolved neighborhood concerns. In the 1970s and 1980s, people often referred to the neighborhood as Mayberry, according to Springston, 63. In 1948, her parents bought the house where she lives with her husband and son. It dates to 1890, Springston said.<\/p><p>In the neighborhood, 49 properties sold in the past year, according to Billy Buck, an associate broker at Buck & Associates. The lowest priced was a one-bedroom, one-bath condominium for $200,000; the highest priced was a five-bedroom, five-bath farmhouse at $1.63 million. Twelve properties are on the market now, ranging from a one-bedroom, two-bath condo for $274,900 to a new five-bedroom, five-bath Craftsman house at $1.799 million.<\/p><p>Welcome wagon: The five-points intersection \u2014 Lee Highway, Old Dominion Drive, Quincy Street, Military Road and Quebec Street \u2014 is dotted with at least two car dealerships and other commercial establishments while nearby is a Safeway and the Cherrydale Hardware, which opened in 1938.<\/p><p>The Cherrydale Volunteer Fire House, built in 1919, is home to such events as the annual spaghetti dinner, concerts and for 90 years each December there is a visit from Santa Claus for children under 12. Other community events are the annual Fourth of July party and picnic at 21st and Stafford streets.

Just gather at join.me.<\/p><p>If you've decided that it's time to leave your bathrobe at home, let your favorite coffee shop have its corner table back, and join a coworking space, you're only halfway there. Though coworking can have a lot of perks, how you take advantage of them and shape your experience is up to you.<\/p><p>\"We've had people who within the first week they've kind of immersed themselves [in]to events and socializing with other people here, or they're just here, they do their work, and then they take off,\" says Jeff Park, who manages the Ravenswood Coworking Group in Chicago. \"We know that they come in, but I think for them that's enough for them. They just want to be around other people in a productive environment.\"<\/p><p>Whether you're aiming to be as productive as possible without a lot of socializing or trying to build a strong professional community that you can turn to for resources and support, these five tips can help you get the most out of your coworking experience.<\/p><p>Green Spaces, a coworking space in Tribeca, specializes in environmentally focused businesses. Mountain View-based Cubes & Crayons combines childcare and coworking. WorkBar in Boston is hosted in a 2,500-square-foot space and has separate areas for cafe-like and quieter working styles. Coworking Brooklyn uses a small room that functions as an art gallery by night.<\/p><p>The coworking experience varies drastically depending on which space you're using. Different spaces have different levels of interaction with other workers, formality and general vibe. While some spaces, like Green Spaces and Cubes & Crayons, state their niche upfront, you'll only be able to gauge what the environment is like by dropping in. Most spaces have daily drop-in rates. Try a couple of different spaces to see what works best for you before you commit. You can find a list of space around the world on the Coworking Wiki.<\/p><p>\"See if the people in the space are people who you could go and see every day\u2026if it's not, then go to the next space,\" says Jay Catalan, the co-founder of a coworking space in Vancouver called The Network Hub.<\/p><p>It's less awkward to introduce yourself on the first day than to work alongside someone for months before asking their name. Even if you're not usually outgoing, try to make a special effort for the first week or two when you start in a new coworking space.<\/p><p>\"Just make introductions and it goes a long way\u2026We've had some people they wish they had met sooner because it turns out they did similar lines of work and just talking about it or actually sharing work, it's not something you want to find out when you only have a couple more months left on your project or something,\" Park says.<\/p><p>If you're shy about meeting people, try getting creative (like, for instance, bringing food). Bill Jacobson and Dave Ulrich, who co-founded WorkBar, said that one new coworker at WorkBar Boston showed up with a big box of doughnuts. \"He got to know everybody pretty quick,\" Jacobson says.<\/p><p>Don't stop interacting with your coworkers after you introduce yourself. One of the biggest benefits of coworking is the built-in community of professionals working across different industries.<\/p><p>\"It may not seem directly 'productive' to chat with your coworker for 10 minutes mid-day, but indirectly, it yields greater results than almost anything else you could spend time on,\" says Parker Whitney, office manager for Philadelphia coworking space Independents Hall, though he says, \"Invest in your community by taking (not faking) interest in what its members do, and it will take you with it\u2026The people you've always wanted to know are sitting all around you. Ask questions. Learn. Most importantly, help them when you can.\"<\/p><p>If you are too busy during the workday for water cooler conversation, most coworking spaces host happy hours, seminars or other events that are prime opportunities for learning more about your coworkers.<\/p><p>\"Even when you work for yourself, it's important to realize your limitations,\" says Dave Martorana, a freelance Python & iPhone developer who works at Independents Hall. \"If you're a software developer, you're not necessarily a designer, product manager, or marketer as well. When you work at a coworking space, people with those skills probably work right next to you and are just as interested in building something awesome as you are.\"<\/p><p>While coworking one day, I ended up testing someone's website, getting caught in the crossfire of a music choice showdown, and participating in a raised-hand vote about which suit jacket a fellow coworker should wear to a meeting.

Blacksberg, boboroshi, steveyb","87":"Termed a \"man of enough words\" recently by Jim Harbaugh, 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick needed just three syllables Sunday to explain why wide receiver Michael Crabtree has emerged as his favorite target.<\/p><p>In San Francisco's past three games, Crabtree has been targeted 34 times, 20 more than wide receiver Randy Moss, who is second in targets over that span. Tight end Vernon Davis? He has eight targets in the past three games.<\/p><p>It's hard to argue with Kaepernick's pecking order, given the results.<\/p><p>In a 41-34 win over the Patriots on Sunday, Crabtree (7 catches, 107 yards, 2 TDs) was featured on the 49ers' first possession - a tone-setting 63-yard touchdown march - with drive-opening catches of 11 and 13 yards. Kaepernick also threw his final pass to Crabtree, a 38-yard game-winner on a play that wasn't designed for San Francisco's No. 1 wide receiver.<\/p><p>In his past three games, Crabtree has 23 catches for 301 yards and two touchdowns with 90-plus receiving yards in each game. Prior to his streak, he had 90-plus receiving yards in five of the first 53 games of his four-year career.<\/p><p>In his five starts, Kaepernick has a 113.6 rating when targeting Crabtree, who has helped earn his confidence with reliable hands. According to Pro Football Focus, Crabtree has three drops in Kaepernick's starts, an impressive figure given the heat the Howitzer-armed quarterback puts on his throws.<\/p><p>On KNBR Tuesday, Harbaugh, who famously declared in the offseason Crabtree had the best hands he'd ever seen, crowed a bit when asked if there was a special Kaepernick-Crabtree chemistry.<\/p><p>\"Yeah, I think there is,\" Harbaugh said. \"But Michael has been doing this all year now. Talked about it every week, the ability to catch, nobody catches the ball better than Michael Crabtree. I think back to last summer when we were talking about the same topic. It might have even been on this show. A lot of people 'What? The greatest hands you've ever seen?' Nobody mentions that any more. Boy, the evidence sure is there.\"<\/p><p>With at least 10 catches and 132 yards over the final two regular-season games, Crabtree (73 catches, 868 yards) would become the 49ers' first 1,000-yard receiver since Terrell Owens in 2003 and will have the most receptions since Owens hauled in 100 in 2002.<\/p><p>Davis, who had team-highs in targets (eight), receptions (six) and yards (83) in Kaepernick's first start against Chicago last month, has since become an afterthought. He had one catch for 10 yards against the Patriots, and four catches, 29 yards and nine targets over the last four games.<\/p><p>Davis said he's yet to establish a chemistry with Kaepernick that matches the connection he had with former starter Alex Smith.<\/p><p>\"You have to develop that chemistry, that bond so you can be on the same page,\" Davis said. \"That's something me and Kaep don't have right now. We don't have it. You have to expect it because he just stepped in. Me and Alex, we've been here.\"<\/p><p>Asked why Crabtree has been quick to get on the same page, Davis said the red-hot wide receiver has been running shorter routes. However, he also noted, as Kaepernick did Sunday night, that Crabtree has earned his targets by breaking free from coverage.<\/p><p>\"Crab is a pretty good route runner,\" Davis said. \"He's getting open and Kaep is finding him.\"<\/p><p>Eric Branch is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.

This is not going away.<\/p><p>But, Newt can turn his pas-de-deux on the loveseat with Nancy into an opportunity to promote a consistent and electable political message.<\/p><p>Because he will be asked about this at every turn, Newt will have the air time and the opportunity to tell the truth on climate change\u2014based upon real science\u2014and to interface it with a limited-government philosophy. The two are easy to do.<\/p><p>Start with the obvious. Instead of waffling on the subject, he could just point out that earth's surface temperature is about 1\u00b0C warmer than it was a century ago. There were two periods of warming, the first from about 1910 through 1945, and the second from the mid-1970s to the late-1990s. They were both roughly the same magnitude. Because the first one was long before we put the majority of fossil carbon into the atmosphere, Newt can say\u2014with scientific authority\u2014that the magnitude of 'natural' climate change is likely to be at least as large as what humans have done.<\/p><p>Then Newt should proceed to the future. It's not the heat, it's the sensitivity. How much it will warm in the future is a function of how sensitive the atmosphere is to doubling atmospheric carbon dioxide. There are a number of independent arguments now coming together showing that this value may have been overestimated. The reference for the most recent is a November issue of Science.<\/p><p>Next, a little refreshing honesty: in 2009, the House of Representatives passed a cap-and-trade bill (which the Senate did not) commanding that the average american\u201438 years from now\u2014be allowed the carbon dioxide emissions of the average citizen in 1867. Prior to its passage, Newt was undeniably for such a system. Newt could call that that the \"second dumbest thing\" he has done and be finished with it.<\/p><p>After setting the record straight, how about interjecting his own political philosophy? When asked what to do about global warming, he should give the honest answer: if the atmosphere indeed is not as sensitive to carbon dioxide changes as previously thought, the correct response is nothing.<\/p><p>That's because \"nothing\" really means something. Newt should channel his historian. When markets are free, capital supports innovation more efficiently than when they aren't. Think about the remarkable changes in energy and technology in the last 100 years. Isn't it rather obvious that the same will occur in the next century, if only we don't hinder capital development? Newt might even use the catchy saw (first sloganed by Northern Illinois Gas in 1972) the future belongs to the efficient, and that there are impressive market forces that advantage those who produce things efficiently or produce efficient things.<\/p><p>When the doomsayers say Newt is believing in a Deus ex machine to dramatically cut carbon dioxide emissions, he might point out that those were the same folks who, only a very few years ago, told us we were running out of natural gas. Innovation and capital revolutionized drilling and fracturing shale, and we now know we have literally hundreds of years of it under our feet. There are a lot more voters and delegates around the country who will benefit from the shale revolution than there are in ethanol-addicted Iowa.","89":"WASHINGTON \u2014 President Obama is pressing United Nations nuclear inspectors to release classified intelligence information showing that Iran is designing and experimenting with nuclear weapons technology. The president's push is part of a larger American effort to further isolate and increase pressure on Iran after accusing it of a plot to assassinate Saudi Arabia's ambassador to the United States.<\/p><p>If the United Nations' watchdog group agrees to publicize the evidence, including new data from recent months, it would almost certainly revive a debate that has been dormant during the Arab Spring about how aggressively the United States and its allies, including Israel, should move to halt Iran's suspected weapons program.<\/p><p>Over the longer term, several senior Obama administration officials said in interviews, they are mulling a ban on financial transactions with Iran's central bank \u2014 a move that has been opposed by China and other Asian nations. Also being considered is an expansion of the ban on the purchase of petroleum products sold by companies controlled by the country's elite military force, the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps.<\/p><p>The Revolutionary Guards are also believed to oversee the military side of the nuclear program, and they are the parent of the Quds Force, which Washington has accused of directing the assassination plot.<\/p><p>The proposed sanctions come as administration officials confront skepticism around the world about their allegations that Iran was behind the plot and limited options about what they can do \u2014 as well as growing pressure from Republicans and some Democrats in Congress to take tougher action against Iran, with the central bank and the oil industry high on lawmakers' lists.<\/p><p>All of the proposed sanctions carry with them considerable political and economic risks. Yukiya Amano, the cautious director general of the United Nations group, the International Atomic Energy Agency, talked publicly in September about publishing some of the most delicate data suggesting Iran worked on nuclear triggers and warheads. But officials who have spoken with him say he is concerned that his inspectors could be ejected from Iran, shutting the best, though narrow, window into its nuclear activities.<\/p><p>Similarly, China and Russia, among other major Iranian trading partners, have resisted further oil and financial sanctions, saying the goal of isolating Iran is a poor strategy. Even inside the Obama administration, some officials say they fear any crackdown on Iranian oil exports could drive up oil prices when the United States and European economies are weak. As one senior official put it, \"You don't want to tip the U.S. into a downturn just to punish the Iranians.\"<\/p><p>Senior administration officials, who would not speak publicly about internal negotiations over the sanctions, say no recommendation on acting against the central bank has gone to Mr. Obama, who vowed last week to make sure Iran would face the \"toughest sanctions\" for what he said was its role in the sensational scheme to hire a Mexican drug cartel to kill the Saudi envoy.<\/p><p>The decision to press the International Atomic Energy Agency was brewing even before the plot against the Saudi ambassador was discovered, but that discovery prompted the White House to pursue a full-court, public press of the agency to release the sensitive intelligence.<\/p><p>Officials familiar with the evidence say it creates extraordinarily uncomfortable questions for the Iranians to answer, but does not definitively point to the construction of a weapon. Instead, it details work on individual technologies essential for designing and detonating a nuclear device, including how to turn uranium into bomb fuel, how to cast conventional explosives in a shape that can set off a nuclear blast, and how to make detonators, generate neutrons to spur a chain reaction, measure detonation waves and make nose cones for missiles.<\/p><p>Tommy Vietor, the spokesman for the National Security Council, said Saturday that \"the United States believes that a comprehensive assessment would be invaluable for the international community in its consideration of Iran's nuclear program and what to do about it.\" Iran has declared that all of the documents suggesting work on how to create a weapon that could fit atop an Iranian missile are \"fabrications\" intended to justify an attack. The country has been the target of covert attacks, including the assassinations of some nuclear scientists and a computer worm that disabled some of Iran's nuclear centrifuges.<\/p><p>The Obama administration, since coming to office, has never publicly presented detailed evidence to back up its claim that Iran is driving toward a weapon or creating the technology to assemble one quickly, should it need it. But it has discussed the evidence widely with allies.<\/p><p>In part the administration has hesitated to discuss the evidence because, after the failure to find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq in 2003, any American evidence is considered suspect. Widespread questions about the plot against the Saudis last week underscored how deep those suspicions run.<\/p><p>But Iran is a different kind of case. Inspectors visit regularly, measuring Iran's output of uranium, including recent production of the material, enriched to 20 percent purity, that takes it far closer to the kind of fuel needed for a weapon. Iran said recently that it would produce more of the 20 percent enriched material than it needs for a small medical research reactor, which prompted new concerns that it is building a stockpile that could be converted to weapons use.","90":"MADRID (AP) \u2013 Spain's grinding economic misery will get worse this year despite the country's request for a European financial lifeline of up to $125 billion to save its banks, Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said Sunday.<\/p><p>A day after the country conceded it needed outside help following months of denying it would seek assistance, Rajoy said more Spaniards will lose their jobs in a country where one out of every four are already unemployed.<\/p><p>\"This year is going to be a bad one,\" Rajoy said Sunday in his first comments about the rescue since it was announced the previous evening by his economy minister.<\/p><p>The conservative prime minister added that the economy, stuck in its second recession in three years, will still contract the previously predicted 1.7 percent even with the help. Small businesses and families starving for credit will eventually get relief as the funding props up banks and they increase lending, but Rajoy didn't offer guidance on when.<\/p><p>Spain on Saturday became the fourth \u2014 and largest \u2014 of the 17 countries that use Europe's common currency to request a bailout \u2014 a big blow to a nation that a few years ago took pride as the continent's economic superstar only to see it become the hot spot in the eurozone debt crisis. Its economy is the eurozone's fourth largest after Germany, France and Italy.<\/p><p>Across the country, Spaniards reacted with a mixture of anger and relief to the news. The amount of the rescue fund, if all is tapped, amounts to \u20ac21,000 of new debt for each person in the nation of 47 million where the average annual salary for those with work is about the same amount and the unemployment rate for those under age 25 is 52 percent.<\/p><p>The country is already reeling from deep austerity cuts Rajoy has imposed over the last six months that have raised taxes, made it easier to hire and fire workers, and cut deep into cherished government programs including education and national health care.<\/p><p>\"It's obviously a shame,\" said civil servant Luisa Saraguren, 44, as she strolled on a sunny Sunday morning with her young daughter. \"But this bailout was fully predictable, and the consequences of this help are going to be a lot bigger compared to the cuts we've been living with already.\"<\/p><p>Rajoy took pains to avoid the word bailout Sunday, saying Spain's rescue package is a line of credit that its most troubled banks will be able to tap. The assistance will not come with the outside control over government macroeconomic policy like that imposed Greece, Ireland and Portugal when their public finances were bailed out.<\/p><p>He said interest rates on the loans will be considerably lower than the rate near 7 percent that Spain has been forced to pay recently on the international debt markets, a level that forced the other countries to seek bailouts.<\/p><p>Spain will regain the economic credibility it has lost by shoring up its banks, which will result in credit being restored so businesses and individuals shut off from loans can start borrowing and the economy will grow again, Rajoy insisted, again without saying when.<\/p><p>Europe's widening recession and financial crisis has hurt companies and investors around the world. Providing a financial lifeline to Spanish banks is likely to relieve anxiety on the Spanish economy \u2014 which is five times larger than Greece's \u2014 and on markets concerned about the country's ability to pay its way.<\/p><p>Spain's financial problems are not due to Greek-style government over-spending. The country's banks particularly its savings banks or \"cajas,\" got caught up in the collapse of a real estate bubble in 2008 that got worse over the past four years. However, as Spain's leaders have struggled for a solution to their banking crisis, the country's borrowing costs have soared close to the level that forced the governments of Greece, Portugal and Ireland to seek rescues.<\/p><p>Some of Spain's banks are struggling with by toxic real estate loans and assets amid fears the problem will get worse as more jobless people can't pay their mortgages. The Bank of Spain says the toxic loans and assets total around \u20ac180 billion. Nationalized lender Bankia SA, which has requested \u20ac19 billion in aid, has \u20ac32 billion in toxic assets. Around four other banks serving the domestic market are considered prime candidates for bailouts.<\/p><p>\"I could never get my mind round the scale of consumption in Spain over the past 20 years, having known it in the 1960s when it was still extremely poor,\" said Paul Preston, a history professor and expert on Spain with the London School of Economics. \"Lots of people enjoyed the consumer boom, but not everybody. Now everybody's having to pay for it.\"<\/p><p>Rajoy blamed Spain's woes on the previous Socialist administration of Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero without mentioning him or his government by name. Zapatero was ousted by Rajoy in a landslide last November by voters outraged over the Socialist handling of the economy.<\/p><p>\"Last year Spain's public administration spent \u20ac90 billion more than it took in, this can't be maintained, we can't live like that,\" Rajoy said.<\/p><p>But Socialist Party leader Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba said Rajoy should acknowledge that Spain is now in bailout territory.<\/p><p>\"The government is trying to make us believe that we've won the lottery, that the Three Kings of Orient have arrived, and that isn't so,\" Rubalcaba said.<\/p><p>After his press conference, Rajoy defended his decision to jet off an hour later to Poland to see Spain's famed national football team take on Italy in the Euro 2012 competition. He said he would be on the ground in Gdansk only for the game before flying back to Madrid Sunday night.<\/p><p>\"I'll be there two and a half hours and then I'll leave,\" Rajoy said. \"I think the national team deserves it.\"","91":"Friday, May 5th 2000, 2:12AM<\/p><p>GLADIATOR. With Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, Connie Nielsen, Oliver Reed. Directed by Ridley Scott. At area theaters. Running time: 154 mins. Rated R: Gory violence, incest theme. 3 1\/2 Stars.<\/p><p>If there's a soft spot in your heart for the sword-&-sandal epic - and from the star rating above, I think you can guess where I stand - then you'll swoon with giddy delight over \"Gladiator,\" a sweaty, stylish hunkfest that takes you back to the days of \"Ben-Hur,\" \"Spartacus\" and the so recently departed Steve Reeves.<\/p><p>From his biceps to his gluteus, Maximus is maximus. This Roman general turned slave turned gladiator hasn't a shred of humor, but then, he doesn't have time for idle nonsense when he's lopping off heads all day. (The head-lopping is apparently his signature, like the mark of Zorro.)<\/p><p>In director Ridley Scott's thrilling, burnished epic, Maximus no sooner serves the empire by leveling Germania during a snowstorm than Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) tosses him a promotion he doesn't want - to succeed the aged emperor and whip Rome back into shape. All Maximus wants is to go home to his wife and child in the suburbs.<\/p><p>The careworn Russell Crowe is physically and temperamentally perfect for the part of Maximus. Still carrying some of the weight he packed on for \"The Insider,\" he's no gym-toned pretty boy. He's solid, beefy, rough-hewn, creaking along in his heavy leather costume, with a look on his puss of weary disdain.<\/p><p>What makes him sexy is his sense of honor and loyalty: \"What we do in life echoes in eternity!\" Anyway, it can't be his hygiene, although he is frequently bathed in a sanctifying golden glow.<\/p><p>After a coup by the emperor's weak-kneed son, Commodus (a whiny, surprisingly fleshy Joaquin Phoenix), Maximus' fortunes change. He winds up being thrown to the tigers, two shows daily, in Rome's Colosseum, the entertainment complex of its day.<\/p><p>Crowe, like his character, must grimly come to terms with the fact that, actor or gladiator, it's all about showmanship. Give the crowd what it wants, either at the multiplex or in the arena, and you can write your own ticket.<\/p><p>\"I have power only to amuse the mob,\" he spits contemptuously like a Shakespearean actor reduced to dinner theater.<\/p><p>The plot, about avenging honor, provides brief respite between an array of hand-to-hand battles that are pitched so furiously that individual components barely register; they're subliminal suggestions of computer-assisted carnage, with Jackson Pollock sprays of blood. For fans of the genre, yes, this is a good thing.<\/p><p>Connie Nielsen plays Commodus' sister and possible love interest for Maximus once his family is dispatched (politics, you know). Nielsen's costumes are laced up like bondage gear, and there is a tantalizing hint of romance past.<\/p><p>But the camera only has eyes for Crowe. The glowering! The seething! The hooded gaze! The quiet suffering! (Watch him carve away a tattoo he no longer has use for. No anesthetic! No disinfectant!)<\/p><p>The supporting cast makes for a gauntlet of worthy friends and adversaries, all of them thinkers, including Derek Jacobi (\"I, Claudius\") as a senator, Djimon Hounsou (\"Amistad\") as a fellow gladiator and Oliver Reed, who died with two days to go on the shoot, looking a little woozy as a gladiator entrepreneur.<\/p><p>Reed's character is the one most in touch with the movie's premise - that entertainment is the goal, and a worthy one at that.","92":"Tim Burrack, a northern Iowa farmer in his 44th growing season, has taken to keeping a wary eye out for unfamiliar vehicles around his 300 acres of genetically modified corn seeds.<\/p><p>Along with other farmers in this vast agricultural region, he has upped his vigilance ever since Mo Hailong and six other Chinese nationals were accused by U.S. authorities in 2013 of digging up seeds from Iowa farms and planning to send them back to China.<\/p><p>The case, in which Mo pleaded guilty in January, has laid bare the value\u2014and vulnerability\u2014of advanced food technology in a world with 7 billion mouths to feed, 1.36 billion of them Chinese.<\/p><p>Citing that case and others as evidence of a growing economic and national security threat to America's farm sector, U.S. law enforcement officials are urging agriculture executives and security officers to increase their vigilance and report any suspicious activity.<\/p><p>But on a March 30 visit to Iowa, Justice Department officials could offer little advice to ensure against similar thefts, underlining how agricultural technology lying in open fields can be more vulnerable than a computer network or a factory floor.<\/p><p>\"It may range down to traditional barriers like a fence and doing human patrols to making sure you get good visuals on what's occurring,\" Assistant Attorney General John Carlin, head of the Justice Department's national security division, said when touring Iowa State University.<\/p><p>But agriculture sector executives say fences and guards are not feasible, due to the high cost and impracticality of guarding hundreds of thousands of acres.<\/p><p>Tom McBride, intellectual property attorney at Monsanto\u2014one of the firms whose seeds were targeted by Mo\u2014said it safeguards its genetically modified organism (GMO) technology by protecting its computers, patenting seeds and keeping fields like Burrack's unmarked. Monsanto mon says it is not considering physical barriers like fences or guards.<\/p><p>The FBI and the U.S. Justice Department say cases of espionage in the agriculture sector have been growing since Mo was first discovered digging in an Iowan field in May 2011. Over the past two years, U.S. companies, government research facilities and universities have all been targeted, according to the FBI.<\/p><p>Although prosecutors were unable to establish a Chinese government link to Mo's group, the case adds to U.S.-China frictions over what Washington says is increasing economic espionage and trade secret theft by Beijing and its proxies.<\/p><p>A U.S. law enforcement official told Reuters the agency looked for a connection between the Chinese government and the conspiracy carried out by Mo.<\/p><p>\"In cases like this, we can see connections, but proving to the threshold needed in court requires that we have documents that the government has directed this,\" the official said. \"It's almost impossible to get.\"<\/p><p>A Chinese embassy spokesman in Washington, Zhu Haiquan, said he did not have detailed information on the Mo case but that China \"stands firm\" on the protection of intellectual property and maintains \"constant communication and cooperation\" with the U.S. government on the issue.<\/p><p>On his visit to Washington last September, President Xi Jinping reiterated China's denial of any government role in the hacking of U.S. corporate secrets.<\/p><p>Mo, an employee of Chinese firm Kings Nower Seed, pleaded guilty to stealing seed grown by U.S. firms Monsanto, Dupont Pioneer dd and LG Seeds.<\/p><p>Prosecutors say he specifically targeted fields that grow the parent seeds needed to replicate GMO corn. The FBI says it suspects he was given the location by workers for the seed companies, but did not charge any employees.<\/p><p>DuPont Pioneer and LG Seeds declined to comment for this story.<\/p><p>Mo, whose case was prosecuted by the Justice Department as a national security matter rather than a simple criminal case, now faces a sentence of up to five years in prison. Five others charged in the case are still wanted by the FBI and are believed to have fled to China or Argentina. Charges were dropped against a sixth Chinese suspect.<\/p><p>The number of international economic espionage cases referred to the FBI is rising, up 15% each year between 2009 and 2014 and up 53% in 2015. The majority of cases reported involve Chinese nationals, the U.S. law enforcement official told Reuters. In the agriculture sector, organic insecticide, irrigation equipment and rice, along with corn, are all suspected to have been targeted, including by Chinese nationals, the official said.<\/p><p>Mo Hongjian, vice president of Kings Nower Seed's parent company, Beijing Dabeinong Technology Group, declined to comment on the case or on the company's connection with the Chinese government.<\/p><p>The parent firm is privately owned, but says it receives government money for research in \"science and technology.\"<\/p><p>China bans commercial growing of GMO grains due to public opposition to the technology and imports of GMO corn have to be approved by the agriculture ministry. Still, President Xi called in 2014 for China to innovate and dominate the technique, which promises high yields through resistance to drought, pests and disease.<\/p><p>In January, a Greenpeace report found some Chinese farmers are illegally growing GMO corn whose strains belong to companies including Monsanto, Syngenta syt and DuPont Pioneer.<\/p><p>Monsanto, which supplies Burrack's seed, said it can block foreign groups who request to tour their lab and learning center in Huxley, Iowa. For the past few years, Monsanto says it has run its own background checks on Chinese delegations that ask for a tour, and, if they are approved, boosts security to be sure they do not steal anything or take pictures.<\/p><p>In Washington, U.S. senators have called for a review of the $43 billion deal by state-owned ChemChina to buy Swiss seed group Syngenta, which generates nearly a quarter of its revenue from North America.<\/p><p>Acquiring GMO seed and successfully recreating a corn plant would allow Chinese companies to skip over roughly eight years of research and $1.5 billion spent annually by Monsanto to develop the corn, the company says.<\/p><p>Burrack's farm itself was not targeted by Mo, though he grows the Monsanto parent seed that the Chinese national was digging for. Burrack grows the corn in two fields in front of and behind his house where he can watch them, a small part of his 2,800-acre farm.<\/p><p>He said he is told by Monsanto where and when to plant the parent seed, but has never been told to keep what he is planting a secret.<\/p><p>\"What no one seems to understand is that they're stealing from people like me,\" Burrack said. \"They're stealing the research that farmers pay for when they buy Monsanto seed.\"","93":"Though it may feel out of the way \u2014 far, far east on the Lower East Side \u2014 there's no missing American Realness once you get there. In its seventh edition, this annual festival of contemporary performance announces itself boldly, its name projected in big block letters on the facade of Abrons Arts Center, home to most of the festival's 18 boundary-blurring productions.<\/p><p>It doesn't take much to inject new life into an event sometimes at risk of stagnating, even as it champions the fresh, the unseen, the unexpected. At opening night on Thursday, visitors were guided from show to show through stairwells and hallways generally closed to the public. For anyone well acquainted with Abrons, as many Realness-goers are, this proved a simple, effective way to reinvent familiar spaces.<\/p><p>Masterminded by Thomas Benjamin Snapp Pryor, Realness coincides with the citywide conference of the Association of Performing Arts Presenters \u2014 international curators and producers in the market for new work \u2014 which returns each year like a recurring dream, or nightmare, depending on your relationship to the idea of shopping for live art. Last year's festival was full of work bemoaning the economic plight of performers; this year's first two productions struck out in less sullen directions, while still folding in some self-reflexive critique (also available in the form of Realness swag declaring, \"I Suffer From Realness\").<\/p><p>First was \"Culture Administration & Trembling,\" a biodiverse collaboration among the performers Jennifer Lacey, Antonija Livingstone, Dominique P\u00e9trin and Stephen Thompson. Ticket holders were instructed to remove their shoes, then led to the second floor of the arts complex, where a usually drab lobby had been transformed with geometric and botanical designs on the floor and walls.<\/p><p>Ms. Lacey, Ms. Livingstone, Mr. Thompson and Dana Michel crawled languidly around the asymmetrical room, the audience huddled around the perimeter, to a soundscape of intermittent bird song. Ms. P\u00e9trin appeared just as calmly immersed in her task of adorning the ground with origami squares. Three live snakes, delivered from offstage, soon joined in. Humans and reptiles slid over and around one another.<\/p><p>This was just the first of many tenuously related, increasingly chaotic episodes, including the arrival of two Chihuahuas (the snakes, not to worry, had exited) and a migration into the adjacent black-box theater for a ritualistic ringing of hand-held bells. A mysterious voice, accompanying a video projection, pronounced, \"This piece will not save us.\" Ms. Lacey, cradling a small, three-legged dog while bending and stretching her limbs, told a story about an artist and an institution (Realness, perhaps) trying to spice up their relationship like old lovers. What to do with all this information? I thought of dance as undomesticated wildlife, of the predators and prey involved in buying and selling performance.<\/p><p>Down one set of stairs and up another, in a tucked-away dance studio not often used for performances, the choreographer Heather Kravas, visiting from Seattle, offered the New York premiere of \"dead, disappears.\" Ms. Kravas was her own predator and protector in this stark, self-punishing solo, as she put herself through perilous paces inspired by the sculptor Richard Serra's \"Verb List,\" a series of actions that he associated with making his pieces.<\/p><p>What seemed at first like arbitrary acts of masochism \u2014 walking on tiptoe with a trash bag over her head while barking two-syllable phrases \u2014 deepened into a formidable exploration of language, the female body and the power play between them. Having duct-taped a pillow to a chair, as if it were a prisoner, Ms. Kravas pounded it with a long pole, shouting a list of alphabetized verbs, one per swipe. By the end, in whatever this struggle had been, she had secured the upper hand.<\/p><p>American Realness continues through Jan. 17.

Tight end Vernon Davis? He has eight targets in the past three games.<\/p><p>It's hard to argue with Kaepernick's pecking order, given the results.<\/p><p>In a 41-34 win over the Patriots on Sunday, Crabtree (7 catches, 107 yards, 2 TDs) was featured on the 49ers' first possession - a tone-setting 63-yard touchdown march - with drive-opening catches of 11 and 13 yards. Kaepernick also threw his final pass to Crabtree, a 38-yard game-winner on a play that wasn't designed for San Francisco's No. 1 wide receiver.<\/p><p>In his past three games, Crabtree has 23 catches for 301 yards and two touchdowns with 90-plus receiving yards in each game. Prior to his streak, he had 90-plus receiving yards in five of the first 53 games of his four-year career.<\/p><p>In his five starts, Kaepernick has a 113.6 rating when targeting Crabtree, who has helped earn his confidence with reliable hands. According to Pro Football Focus, Crabtree has three drops in Kaepernick's starts, an impressive figure given the heat the Howitzer-armed quarterback puts on his throws.<\/p><p>On KNBR Tuesday, Harbaugh, who famously declared in the offseason Crabtree had the best hands he'd ever seen, crowed a bit when asked if there was a special Kaepernick-Crabtree chemistry.<\/p><p>\"Yeah, I think there is,\" Harbaugh said. \"But Michael has been doing this all year now. Talked about it every week, the ability to catch, nobody catches the ball better than Michael Crabtree. I think back to last summer when we were talking about the same topic. It might have even been on this show. A lot of people 'What? The greatest hands you've ever seen?' Nobody mentions that any more. Boy, the evidence sure is there.\"<\/p><p>With at least 10 catches and 132 yards over the final two regular-season games, Crabtree (73 catches, 868 yards) would become the 49ers' first 1,000-yard receiver since Terrell Owens in 2003 and will have the most receptions since Owens hauled in 100 in 2002.<\/p><p>Davis, who had team-highs in targets (eight), receptions (six) and yards (83) in Kaepernick's first start against Chicago last month, has since become an afterthought. He had one catch for 10 yards against the Patriots, and four catches, 29 yards and nine targets over the last four games.<\/p><p>Davis said he's yet to establish a chemistry with Kaepernick that matches the connection he had with former starter Alex Smith.<\/p><p>\"You have to develop that chemistry, that bond so you can be on the same page,\" Davis said. \"That's something me and Kaep don't have right now. We don't have it. You have to expect it because he just stepped in. Me and Alex, we've been here.\"<\/p><p>Asked why Crabtree has been quick to get on the same page, Davis said the red-hot wide receiver has been running shorter routes. However, he also noted, as Kaepernick did Sunday night, that Crabtree has earned his targets by breaking free from coverage.<\/p><p>\"Crab is a pretty good route runner,\" Davis said. \"He's getting open and Kaep is finding him.\"<\/p><p>Eric Branch is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.

The president's push is part of a larger American effort to further isolate and increase pressure on Iran after accusing it of a plot to assassinate Saudi Arabia's ambassador to the United States.<\/p><p>If the United Nations' watchdog group agrees to publicize the evidence, including new data from recent months, it would almost certainly revive a debate that has been dormant during the Arab Spring about how aggressively the United States and its allies, including Israel, should move to halt Iran's suspected weapons program.<\/p><p>Over the longer term, several senior Obama administration officials said in interviews, they are mulling a ban on financial transactions with Iran's central bank \u2014 a move that has been opposed by China and other Asian nations. Also being considered is an expansion of the ban on the purchase of petroleum products sold by companies controlled by the country's elite military force, the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps.<\/p><p>The Revolutionary Guards are also believed to oversee the military side of the nuclear program, and they are the parent of the Quds Force, which Washington has accused of directing the assassination plot.<\/p><p>The proposed sanctions come as administration officials confront skepticism around the world about their allegations that Iran was behind the plot and limited options about what they can do \u2014 as well as growing pressure from Republicans and some Democrats in Congress to take tougher action against Iran, with the central bank and the oil industry high on lawmakers' lists.<\/p><p>All of the proposed sanctions carry with them considerable political and economic risks. Yukiya Amano, the cautious director general of the United Nations group, the International Atomic Energy Agency, talked publicly in September about publishing some of the most delicate data suggesting Iran worked on nuclear triggers and warheads. But officials who have spoken with him say he is concerned that his inspectors could be ejected from Iran, shutting the best, though narrow, window into its nuclear activities.<\/p><p>Similarly, China and Russia, among other major Iranian trading partners, have resisted further oil and financial sanctions, saying the goal of isolating Iran is a poor strategy. Even inside the Obama administration, some officials say they fear any crackdown on Iranian oil exports could drive up oil prices when the United States and European economies are weak. As one senior official put it, \"You don't want to tip the U.S. into a downturn just to punish the Iranians.\"<\/p><p>Senior administration officials, who would not speak publicly about internal negotiations over the sanctions, say no recommendation on acting against the central bank has gone to Mr. Obama, who vowed last week to make sure Iran would face the \"toughest sanctions\" for what he said was its role in the sensational scheme to hire a Mexican drug cartel to kill the Saudi envoy.<\/p><p>The decision to press the International Atomic Energy Agency was brewing even before the plot against the Saudi ambassador was discovered, but that discovery prompted the White House to pursue a full-court, public press of the agency to release the sensitive intelligence.<\/p><p>Officials familiar with the evidence say it creates extraordinarily uncomfortable questions for the Iranians to answer, but does not definitively point to the construction of a weapon. Instead, it details work on individual technologies essential for designing and detonating a nuclear device, including how to turn uranium into bomb fuel, how to cast conventional explosives in a shape that can set off a nuclear blast, and how to make detonators, generate neutrons to spur a chain reaction, measure detonation waves and make nose cones for missiles.<\/p><p>Tommy Vietor, the spokesman for the National Security Council, said Saturday that \"the United States believes that a comprehensive assessment would be invaluable for the international community in its consideration of Iran's nuclear program and what to do about it.\" Iran has declared that all of the documents suggesting work on how to create a weapon that could fit atop an Iranian missile are \"fabrications\" intended to justify an attack. The country has been the target of covert attacks, including the assassinations of some nuclear scientists and a computer worm that disabled some of Iran's nuclear centrifuges.<\/p><p>The Obama administration, since coming to office, has never publicly presented detailed evidence to back up its claim that Iran is driving toward a weapon or creating the technology to assemble one quickly, should it need it. But it has discussed the evidence widely with allies.<\/p><p>In part the administration has hesitated to discuss the evidence because, after the failure to find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq in 2003, any American evidence is considered suspect. Widespread questions about the plot against the Saudis last week underscored how deep those suspicions run.<\/p><p>But Iran is a different kind of case. Inspectors visit regularly, measuring Iran's output of uranium, including recent production of the material, enriched to 20 percent purity, that takes it far closer to the kind of fuel needed for a weapon. Iran said recently that it would produce more of the 20 percent enriched material than it needs for a small medical research reactor, which prompted new concerns that it is building a stockpile that could be converted to weapons use.","96":"By DEXTER FORDMAY 9, 2014<\/p><p>MALIBU, CALIF. \u2014 Good luck, America, with your efforts to pigeonhole the BMW i8.<\/p><p>The car is a post-petroleum brand statement. It's a sci-fi showpiece. It's an ultralight carbon-fiber production car. It's a triumph of parts-bin engineering. It's a take-no-prisoners canyon racer. It's a winged chariot of the Malibu \u00fcber-chic. It's a $136,625 (destination included!) commuter car for Silicon Valley moguls.<\/p><p>The hardware, at least, is straightforward. The central passenger shell is a stiff, lightweight carbon-fiber structure. It is bolted to an aluminum skeleton that holds the 7.1-kilowatt-hour lithium-ion battery pack in its spine.<\/p><p>An electric drive section similar to the one in the BMW i3 people pod is bolted to the front, its 131 horsepower electric motor and 2-speed automatic transmission driving the front wheels. The rear power package is sourced from the new Mini; its 3-cylinder, twin-turbocharged 231-horsepower engine drives the rear wheels through a 6-speed automatic transmission.<\/p><p>The multilayered skin is molded thermoplastic that weighs half as much as steel. Other extreme weight-saving measures, including aluminum wiring and chemically hardened ultrathin glass, keep the weight to 3,267 pounds. The long, light doors swing up and forward. From the front, with doors open, the i8 looks as if it's signaling a touchdown.<\/p><p>The interior is compact yet comfortable, though those over 6-foot-2 may need more legroom, and the rear seats are designed for tiny, limber people.<\/p><p>Getting in is a challenge. The sill is wide, the seat is low, and there's a trick: sit sideways, slide butt in, retract legs. Getting out? Imagine climbing from a bathtub without using your hands.<\/p><p>Pick a personality with the driving-mode buttons. \"Comfort\" keeps the car in electric mode to 37 m.p.h., or until you mash the right-side pedal. The eDrive button keeps things electric to 75 m.p.h. or until the battery fades.<\/p><p>Travel range is about 20 miles in E.V. mode, and recharging takes 1.5 hours at 240 volts or four hours at 120. The Eco-Pro button increases electric efficiency 20 percent by softening the motor response and optimizing climate-control settings. I observed gasoline-powered mileage figures from 27 m.p.g. (impatient cornering) to 37 m.p.g. (safe-and-sane commuting).<\/p><p>In the city, the i8 feels silent, solid and intuitive \u2014 the excitement happens outside, as gawkers track its progress.<\/p><p>On Los Angeles's well-used freeways, the Comfort setting leaves some comfort to be desired. Even with the variable dampers at full soft, the i8 bobs its nose like Muhammad Ali in the first rounds. High-performance tires come standard in the United States; European versions get narrower wheels and taller tires for lower drag and a smoother ride.<\/p><p>In Sport mode, the suspension and steering stiffen and the gas engine roars, pops on upshifts and matches revs downshifting into corners. It sounds great, and it should: much of what you hear is a prerecorded soundtrack piped through the sound system.<\/p><p>The i8 feels strong at full power, but the head-snapping response expected from a partly electric powertrain is absent. The i8 takes time to gather itself, with an atavistic vestige of turbo lag.<\/p><p>On the intestinal twists of Mulholland Highway the i8 can be driven with brutal abandon. The brakes are strong, the chassis is as stiff as a bank vault, and there's enough power to reach the next corner presently. BMW claims a 0-to-60 time of 4.2 seconds, and top speed is 155 m.p.h.<\/p><p>The front tires push when going hard into corners, but everything sticks coming out. Even with the stability control off, the i8 resists spinning its tires \u2014 the software ghost is still there, lurking in the machine.<\/p><p>The i8 is complicated and imperfect. A car that will be used for emissions-free commuting should allow people to get in and get out. It rides harshly. The exterior design is too clever \u2014 the layered rear deck whispers \"Your trunk is open.\"<\/p><p>Still, if the i8 represents the future of sports cars, things are looking bright.<\/p><p>A version of this review appears in print on May 11, 2014, on page AU4 of the New York edition with the headline: The Future Will See You Now.

There are plenty of reasons why these types of movies faded from view in the 1990s, but the fall of the Berlin Wall and the the Soviet Union certainly played a part.<\/p><p>The examples are just as abundant on the other side. The ambiguities of the Vietnam War and the counterculture in the late 1960s and early 1970s undoubtedly offered up the moral murkiness of<\/p><p>\"Midnight Cowboy\" and scores of others. In the post-9\/11 world, meanwhile, movies like<\/p><p>-- with its themes of a destruction-bent enemy that can't be bargained with, and the question of what constitutes an acceptable ethical compromise in fighting that enemy -- have captured our imagination. You can throw<\/p><p>in there too, to the degree the movie was a contemplation of Western interests in the Middle East.<\/p><p>Political eras are, of course, rarely just one thing or another, and the movies we want to see in a given period are hardly monolithic. But as tempting as it is to infer that the success of \"The Expendables\" shows a deeper cultural need, it may well be the wrong inference. When times are confusing, we want movies to reflect that confusion, and even to make sense of it. But we probably don't want to pretend that confusion doesn't exist.<\/p><p>Photo: A scene from \"The Expendables.\" Credit: Lionsgate<\/p><p>Stallone: I'm contemplating an \"Expendables\" sequel<\/p><p>Hollywood wonders if Schwarzenegger will be back","100":"In a Facebook post on Sunday, 'ino announced that it had closed. When the shoebox-shaped and nearly shoebox-size panini shop opened on Bedford Street 15 years ago, there was nothing quite like it in New York, a restaurant that kept things simple and kept prices low, serving flavorful food in a room that was just adorable enough that you could decide, midmeal, that maybe the two of you squeezed into the counter were there on a date, and not just grabbing a bite.<\/p><p>You have to fire up the Wayback Machine to better understand how 'ino helped change how this city eats. Fifteen years ago, New York was a bistro town. There was the old guard: Blue Ribbon, Le Gamin, Jules, Lucky Strike, Raoul's and a dozen others. Then in 1997, a newcomer opened in SoHo named Balthazar, which raised the stakes with its set direction and unlisted reservation line. Balthazar was white-hot: it had perfectly distressed mirrors, fresh and crusty bread, and although it was impossible to get a table unless you knew somebody who knew somebody, you could always go at midnight and eat at the bar.<\/p><p>Soon, New York was lousy with bistros. It was a good era if you wanted a kir, steak frites, escargot, fris\u00e9e lardon, profiteroles. Authenticity, or some version of it, was the point. Everybody was pressing butter into little ramekins to be served at room temperature, changing the paper covering the tablecloths before serving dessert.<\/p><p>Honestly, it was really fun. The restaurants were lively, intimate, sexy. So what if you could recite the menu before you set foot in the door? But if you were a young chef with a measure of vision and creativity, you were stuck either making onion soup and beet salad with goat cheese. Or you worked on the line executing the vision and creativity of an older chef in Midtown or TriBeCa. Prune hadn't yet opened. Neither had Diner. Brooklyn didn't have much of a food scene outside the restaurant row on Smith Street, which was anchored by Patois, a bistro. If you went to Williamsburg, it was to go to a party or to go dancing, not to eat. This was the landscape when Jason and Jennifer Denton opened 'ino on a quiet street in the West Village. The kitchen in the back was the size of a D.J. booth and used the technology of induction burners, which was novel at the time: it was a paninoteca that looked as if it belonged in New York rather than being shipped, tile by mirrored tile, from Milan.<\/p><p>The culinary vocabulary was Italian, but it wasn't sepia-toned and sentimental. Instead, there was a focus on ingredients at a time when, in New York at least, few people cared. It had simple food done well, and sometimes you encountered flavors that weren't lifted out of the songbook. I still have a 13-year-old memory of sharing a shredded duck sandwich with sweet relish, a combination that is about as authentically Italian as a functioning parliament. You could go to 'ino to get something familiar (prosciutto and cheese will never get old), but you could also try something new.<\/p><p>'Ino was a casual joint with integrity, an easygoing place where you could eat well as long as you didn't mind the wait. Today, we take this combination for granted, and expect all kitchens to put some effort into sourcing and display a little creativity no matter how limited the resources. That we do owes a little bit to 'ino.","101":"\"We don't want people coming back or visiting,\" Nugent said. The town is still in an \"imminent danger of fire,\" with several fires still burning nearby. \"I can see black smoke behind the courthouse,\" she said.<\/p><p>The fire in Presidio County has grown to 80,000 acres with only 10% containment, the Forest Service said early Monday.<\/p><p>That growth, according to fire operations chief Mark Sanford, came after the fire \"made a 12-mile run on Saturday.\" Officials still don't know what caused the fast-moving fire, he said.<\/p><p>Despite the damage, Nugent said things could be much worse. \"Tourism is huge\" in Fort Davis, she said, but none of the tourist structures have been burned. The downtown and the historic fort buildings are unscathed, she said.<\/p><p>The blaze, known as the Rock House fire, is currently the largest fire burning in the United States and is just one of 10 fires burning more than 312,000 acres in Texas.<\/p><p>Another 34 homes have burned in a fire in Midland County that has consumed over 16,500 acres and that the state agency on Sunday described as \"very active\" and not at all contained, officials said.<\/p><p>A Red Cross shelter has been set up at Midland College for those displaced or otherwise affected by this wildfire.<\/p><p>\"(Firefighters) can't outrun it,\" said Alan Craft, a spokesman for the state's Lone Star Incident Management Team.<\/p><p>Another large fire near Swenson has scorched some 103,000 acres in three counties, according to the state Forest Service.

With Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, Connie Nielsen, Oliver Reed. Directed by Ridley Scott. At area theaters. Running time: 154 mins. Rated R: Gory violence, incest theme. 3 1\/2 Stars.<\/p><p>If there's a soft spot in your heart for the sword-&-sandal epic - and from the star rating above, I think you can guess where I stand - then you'll swoon with giddy delight over \"Gladiator,\" a sweaty, stylish hunkfest that takes you back to the days of \"Ben-Hur,\" \"Spartacus\" and the so recently departed Steve Reeves.<\/p><p>From his biceps to his gluteus, Maximus is maximus. This Roman general turned slave turned gladiator hasn't a shred of humor, but then, he doesn't have time for idle nonsense when he's lopping off heads all day. (The head-lopping is apparently his signature, like the mark of Zorro.)<\/p><p>In director Ridley Scott's thrilling, burnished epic, Maximus no sooner serves the empire by leveling Germania during a snowstorm than Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) tosses him a promotion he doesn't want - to succeed the aged emperor and whip Rome back into shape. All Maximus wants is to go home to his wife and child in the suburbs.<\/p><p>The careworn Russell Crowe is physically and temperamentally perfect for the part of Maximus. Still carrying some of the weight he packed on for \"The Insider,\" he's no gym-toned pretty boy. He's solid, beefy, rough-hewn, creaking along in his heavy leather costume, with a look on his puss of weary disdain.<\/p><p>What makes him sexy is his sense of honor and loyalty: \"What we do in life echoes in eternity!\" Anyway, it can't be his hygiene, although he is frequently bathed in a sanctifying golden glow.<\/p><p>After a coup by the emperor's weak-kneed son, Commodus (a whiny, surprisingly fleshy Joaquin Phoenix), Maximus' fortunes change. He winds up being thrown to the tigers, two shows daily, in Rome's Colosseum, the entertainment complex of its day.<\/p><p>Crowe, like his character, must grimly come to terms with the fact that, actor or gladiator, it's all about showmanship. Give the crowd what it wants, either at the multiplex or in the arena, and you can write your own ticket.<\/p><p>\"I have power only to amuse the mob,\" he spits contemptuously like a Shakespearean actor reduced to dinner theater.<\/p><p>The plot, about avenging honor, provides brief respite between an array of hand-to-hand battles that are pitched so furiously that individual components barely register; they're subliminal suggestions of computer-assisted carnage, with Jackson Pollock sprays of blood. For fans of the genre, yes, this is a good thing.<\/p><p>Connie Nielsen plays Commodus' sister and possible love interest for Maximus once his family is dispatched (politics, you know). Nielsen's costumes are laced up like bondage gear, and there is a tantalizing hint of romance past.<\/p><p>But the camera only has eyes for Crowe. The glowering! The seething! The hooded gaze! The quiet suffering! (Watch him carve away a tattoo he no longer has use for. No anesthetic! No disinfectant!)<\/p><p>The supporting cast makes for a gauntlet of worthy friends and adversaries, all of them thinkers, including Derek Jacobi (\"I, Claudius\") as a senator, Djimon Hounsou (\"Amistad\") as a fellow gladiator and Oliver Reed, who died with two days to go on the shoot, looking a little woozy as a gladiator entrepreneur.<\/p><p>Reed's character is the one most in touch with the movie's premise - that entertainment is the goal, and a worthy one at that.","103":"Disunion follows the Civil War as it unfolded.<\/p><p>The Lincoln administration may not have gone to war in 1861 to end slavery, but no one bothered to tell that to the slaves. Within six weeks of the firing on Fort Sumter, Gen. Benjamin Butler was forced to decide what to do with three slaves who escaped to Fortress Monroe on the north shore of Virginia's James River. Butler, certainly no abolitionist, nonetheless refused to return the three to their owner, labeling them \"contrabands of war.\"<\/p><p>The term, suitably ambiguous for an administration that as yet had no policy on how to handle the fugitives, found immediate acceptance. As one Union officer wrote, \"Never was a word so speedily adopted by so many people in so short a time.\" Within weeks hundreds of \"contrabands\" \u2014 men, women and children \u2014 flocked to Fortress Monroe and other Union Army positions. Unsure what might greet them, the escaped slaves were yet confident that life under federal control must surely represent an improvement.<\/p><p>It took the federal government more than a year to devise a policy in answer to this thirst for freedom. In August 1861, the First Confiscation Act stripped slaveholders of their claim of ownership, but it failed to clarify whether the slaves were themselves free. The following March Congress prohibited the military from sending escaped slaves back into slavery, and in July the Second Confiscation Act decreed that all slaves that took refuge in Union areas were \"captives of war\" and would be set free.<\/p><p>These legislative actions took on ever greater significance as Union forces moved deeper and deeper into Confederate territory. The growing number of contrabands reaching federal lines necessitated the establishment of dozens of impromptu contraband camps. A draft map compiled by the National Park Service illustrates how the network of these generally transitory camps mirrored the advance of the Union Army along the Mississippi, Tennessee and Cumberland River systems. Grant's Army of the Tennessee spent the summer of 1862 protecting supply lines in western Tennessee and northern Mississippi. Victories at the Battle of Iuka in September and the Battle of Corinth in early October solidified Union control of the area.<\/p><p>Lincoln's announcement of the preliminary Emancipation Proclamation on Sept. 22, 1862, produced an even greater flood of refugees. How best to use and care for these contrabands proved particularly vexing for military leaders under Grant's command. \"You have no idea of the consternation Old Abe's Proclamation is making,\" wrote Gen. Grenville Dodge to his brother in September. The contrabands \"will not even wait until 1st January. I do not know what we shall do with them.\"<\/p><p>Many of these fugitives arrived in an appalling condition. \"There were men, women, and children in every stage of disease or decrepitude often nearly naked, with flesh torn by the terrible experiences of their escape,\" wrote one observer. \"Often the slaves met prejudices against their color more bitter than any they had left behind.\"<\/p><p>On Nov. 11, 1862, Grant took the first step toward addressing the crisis: he named John Eaton, a former high school principal and chaplain of the 27th Ohio Infantry, as superintendent of contrabands and set him at work \"organizing them into suitable companies for working.\" A month later he went further. \"The negroes will be clothed, and in every way provided for, out of their earnings\" \u2014 about 12.5 cents for each pound of cotton picked \u2014 \"so far as practicable,\" he ordered. \"In no case will negroes be forced into the service of the Government, or be enticed away from their homes except when it becomes a military necessity.\"<\/p><p>Grant's policies lent the contraband camps an official status and began to define what a freedman could and could not do once within the Union lines. Personally, Grant appears to have had no particular sympathy for the refugees. He seems to have recognized that, in the words of one observer, \"The soldiers of our army were a good deal opposed to serving the Negro in any manner.\" Nevertheless, the Union commander unreservedly supported Eaton's work and in the process enabled the creation of one of the war's most successful contraband camps, located at Corinth, Miss.<\/p><p>Although formally organized under the direction of General Dodge in early December 1862 and placed under the command of James M. Alexander, chaplain of the 66th Illinois, the Corinth camp likely came into existence as early as September. Initially housed in army tents no longer considered serviceable for Union troops, the freedmen were soon set to work downing trees and clearing land on which to build cabins and lay out streets, which were named for Union generals. Eventually the freedmen also built a four-room school, a commissary, a hospital, a church and an office. The entire camp was divided into wards, complete with ward masters and a police force.<\/p><p>In late 1862 the American Missionary Association sent its first volunteers to Corinth to help care for, educate and minister to the freedmen. In a memoir written years after the war, one such missionary recalled her experience. \"When brought face to face with the slaves,\" she wrote, \"it was like the discovery of a new race.\" The men and women who came to Corinth generally shared a paternalistic optimism and viewed the freedmen as childlike in their enthusiasm for both education and salvation.<\/p><p>The freedmen's thirst for knowledge was undeniable. \"You will find them every hour of daylight, at their books,\" observed the Rev. Edward Pierce in March of 1863. \"We cannot enter a cabin, or tent, but that we see from one to three with books.\" Within no time Pierce and his wife had more than 150 students, and by the end of the summer, the addition of more missionaries enabled the school to accommodate between 300 and 400 children as well as 60 adults at a night school. In August, one of the teachers estimated that as many as 1,000 freedmen had learned to read in the Corinth camp.<\/p><p>Organized religion followed closely on the heels of formal education. Reverend Olds \"saw an earnestness in reference to the Christian life that I have seldom seen. And as I saw their deep earnestness & heard their hearty responses,\" he said, \"I was led to ask where can we find a more impressible people than these?\"<\/p><p>The population of the camp fluctuated between 1,500 and 6,000, as large groups undertook assignments for the Union Army or contracted to work on local plantations. In March 1863, for example, the camp was home to 658 men, 1,440 women and 1,559 children. Among the men were 36 blacksmiths, 48 carpenters, 180 teamsters and 200 cooks. The female ranks included 80 seamstresses, 150 laundresses and 600 cooks. Two-thirds of the men and three-quarters of the women were married, and seven in eight women had children. According to John Eaton's records, the camp had experienced 900 cases of illness, 189 deaths and 45 births.<\/p><p>Life at Corinth changed dramatically after a May 1863 visit by Adj. Gen. Lorenzo Thomas, who was intent on recruiting thousands of contrabands for his newly formed black regiments. With the organization of the 1st Alabama Infantry of African Descent, later renamed the 55th United States Colored Troops, the camp lost most of its able-bodied men.<\/p><p>Their departure to fight left only the women, the young, the old and the infirm to carry on Eaton's ambitious agricultural program, which rested on the cooperative farming of large tracts of abandoned and confiscated land. The program put 400 acres under cultivation, 300 for cotton and 100 for vegetables. Each cabin also had its own subsistence garden. By May 1863, the success of the agricultural program and the presence of a multitude of skilled artisans produced a clear monthly profit of $4,000 to $5,000 for the government, as well as an admirably independent community that Eaton hoped might serve as a model for other camps.<\/p><p>Unfortunately, the success of the Corinth camp proved short-lived. Plans for a winter campaign by Union forces in January 1864 provided a grim reminder that the fate of the freedmen was always secondary to the triumph of the Union cause. The order to relocate the camp's inhabitants 93 miles westward, to Memphis, \"fell like a bomb-shell among our contented people,\" lamented one missionary, \"but military orders are preemptory,\" and they \"must be obeyed.\" The freedmen left their \"well-organized village,\" gardens and farms to tdiv><\/p><p>The move from Corinth destroyed the spirit that had animated the freedmen's success. Some of the new refugees found work on confiscated plantations or in Memphis, but most lived in one of several camps surrounding the city.<\/p><p>\"The destruction of the Corinth camp,\" noted one historian, \"was one of the tragedies of the Civil War.\" Eaton's plan for large-scale cooperative farming fell victim to a bitter struggle between the War and Treasury departments over the leasing of plantations and was never implemented elsewhere. And no more than one or two other camps were able to replicate the strong civilian leadership, well-planned and policed living environment, and emphasis on education that made Corinth a success.<\/p><p>Had the government learned from the model fashioned in northern Mississippi between the fall of 1862 and early 1864, the newly freed slaves might well have enjoyed a far easier transition to life in postwar America.<\/p><p>Sources: Joseph E.

Tight end Vernon Davis? He has eight targets in the past three games.<\/p><p>It's hard to argue with Kaepernick's pecking order, given the results.<\/p><p>In a 41-34 win over the Patriots on Sunday, Crabtree (7 catches, 107 yards, 2 TDs) was featured on the 49ers' first possession - a tone-setting 63-yard touchdown march - with drive-opening catches of 11 and 13 yards. Kaepernick also threw his final pass to Crabtree, a 38-yard game-winner on a play that wasn't designed for San Francisco's No. 1 wide receiver.<\/p><p>In his past three games, Crabtree has 23 catches for 301 yards and two touchdowns with 90-plus receiving yards in each game. Prior to his streak, he had 90-plus receiving yards in five of the first 53 games of his four-year career.<\/p><p>In his five starts, Kaepernick has a 113.6 rating when targeting Crabtree, who has helped earn his confidence with reliable hands. According to Pro Football Focus, Crabtree has three drops in Kaepernick's starts, an impressive figure given the heat the Howitzer-armed quarterback puts on his throws.<\/p><p>On KNBR Tuesday, Harbaugh, who famously declared in the offseason Crabtree had the best hands he'd ever seen, crowed a bit when asked if there was a special Kaepernick-Crabtree chemistry.<\/p><p>\"Yeah, I think there is,\" Harbaugh said. \"But Michael has been doing this all year now. Talked about it every week, the ability to catch, nobody catches the ball better than Michael Crabtree. I think back to last summer when we were talking about the same topic. It might have even been on this show. A lot of people 'What? The greatest hands you've ever seen?' Nobody mentions that any more. Boy, the evidence sure is there.\"<\/p><p>With at least 10 catches and 132 yards over the final two regular-season games, Crabtree (73 catches, 868 yards) would become the 49ers' first 1,000-yard receiver since Terrell Owens in 2003 and will have the most receptions since Owens hauled in 100 in 2002.<\/p><p>Davis, who had team-highs in targets (eight), receptions (six) and yards (83) in Kaepernick's first start against Chicago last month, has since become an afterthought. He had one catch for 10 yards against the Patriots, and four catches, 29 yards and nine targets over the last four games.<\/p><p>Davis said he's yet to establish a chemistry with Kaepernick that matches the connection he had with former starter Alex Smith.<\/p><p>\"You have to develop that chemistry, that bond so you can be on the same page,\" Davis said. \"That's something me and Kaep don't have right now. We don't have it. You have to expect it because he just stepped in. Me and Alex, we've been here.\"<\/p><p>Asked why Crabtree has been quick to get on the same page, Davis said the red-hot wide receiver has been running shorter routes. However, he also noted, as Kaepernick did Sunday night, that Crabtree has earned his targets by breaking free from coverage.<\/p><p>\"Crab is a pretty good route runner,\" Davis said. \"He's getting open and Kaep is finding him.\"<\/p><p>Eric Branch is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.

In March 1863, for example, the camp was home to 658 men, 1,440 women and 1,559 children. Among the men were 36 blacksmiths, 48 carpenters, 180 teamsters and 200 cooks. The female ranks included 80 seamstresses, 150 laundresses and 600 cooks. Two-thirds of the men and three-quarters of the women were married, and seven in eight women had children. According to John Eaton's records, the camp had experienced 900 cases of illness, 189 deaths and 45 births.<\/p><p>Life at Corinth changed dramatically after a May 1863 visit by Adj. Gen.

This is not going away.<\/p><p>But, Newt can turn his pas-de-deux on the loveseat with Nancy into an opportunity to promote a consistent and electable political message.<\/p><p>Because he will be asked about this at every turn, Newt will have the air time and the opportunity to tell the truth on climate change\u2014based upon real science\u2014and to interface it with a limited-government philosophy. The two are easy to do.<\/p><p>Start with the obvious. Instead of waffling on the subject, he could just point out that earth's surface temperature is about 1\u00b0C warmer than it was a century ago. There were two periods of warming, the first from about 1910 through 1945, and the second from the mid-1970s to the late-1990s. They were both roughly the same magnitude. Because the first one was long before we put the majority of fossil carbon into the atmosphere, Newt can say\u2014with scientific authority\u2014that the magnitude of 'natural' climate change is likely to be at least as large as what humans have done.<\/p><p>Then Newt should proceed to the future. It's not the heat, it's the sensitivity. How much it will warm in the future is a function of how sensitive the atmosphere is to doubling atmospheric carbon dioxide. There are a number of independent arguments now coming together showing that this value may have been overestimated. The reference for the most recent is a November issue of Science.<\/p><p>Next, a little refreshing honesty: in 2009, the House of Representatives passed a cap-and-trade bill (which the Senate did not) commanding that the average american\u201438 years from now\u2014be allowed the carbon dioxide emissions of the average citizen in 1867. Prior to its passage, Newt was undeniably for such a system. Newt could call that that the \"second dumbest thing\" he has done and be finished with it.<\/p><p>After setting the record straight, how about interjecting his own political philosophy? When asked what to do about global warming, he should give the honest answer: if the atmosphere indeed is not as sensitive to carbon dioxide changes as previously thought, the correct response is nothing.<\/p><p>That's because \"nothing\" really means something. Newt should channel his historian. When markets are free, capital supports innovation more efficiently than when they aren't. Think about the remarkable changes in energy and technology in the last 100 years. Isn't it rather obvious that the same will occur in the next century, if only we don't hinder capital development? Newt might even use the catchy saw (first sloganed by Northern Illinois Gas in 1972) the future belongs to the efficient, and that there are impressive market forces that advantage those who produce things efficiently or produce efficient things.<\/p><p>When the doomsayers say Newt is believing in a Deus ex machine to dramatically cut carbon dioxide emissions, he might point out that those were the same folks who, only a very few years ago, told us we were running out of natural gas. Innovation and capital revolutionized drilling and fracturing shale, and we now know we have literally hundreds of years of it under our feet. There are a lot more voters and delegates around the country who will benefit from the shale revolution than there are in ethanol-addicted Iowa.","108":"WASHINGTON \u2014 President Obama is pressing United Nations nuclear inspectors to release classified intelligence information showing that Iran is designing and experimenting with nuclear weapons technology. The president's push is part of a larger American effort to further isolate and increase pressure on Iran after accusing it of a plot to assassinate Saudi Arabia's ambassador to the United States.<\/p><p>If the United Nations' watchdog group agrees to publicize the evidence, including new data from recent months, it would almost certainly revive a debate that has been dormant during the Arab Spring about how aggressively the United States and its allies, including Israel, should move to halt Iran's suspected weapons program.<\/p><p>Over the longer term, several senior Obama administration officials said in interviews, they are mulling a ban on financial transactions with Iran's central bank \u2014 a move that has been opposed by China and other Asian nations. Also being considered is an expansion of the ban on the purchase of petroleum products sold by companies controlled by the country's elite military force, the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps.<\/p><p>The Revolutionary Guards are also believed to oversee the military side of the nuclear program, and they are the parent of the Quds Force, which Washington has accused of directing the assassination plot.<\/p><p>The proposed sanctions come as administration officials confront skepticism around the world about their allegations that Iran was behind the plot and limited options about what they can do \u2014 as well as growing pressure from Republicans and some Democrats in Congress to take tougher action against Iran, with the central bank and the oil industry high on lawmakers' lists.<\/p><p>All of the proposed sanctions carry with them considerable political and economic risks. Yukiya Amano, the cautious director general of the United Nations group, the International Atomic Energy Agency, talked publicly in September about publishing some of the most delicate data suggesting Iran worked on nuclear triggers and warheads. But officials who have spoken with him say he is concerned that his inspectors could be ejected from Iran, shutting the best, though narrow, window into its nuclear activities.<\/p><p>Similarly, China and Russia, among other major Iranian trading partners, have resisted further oil and financial sanctions, saying the goal of isolating Iran is a poor strategy. Even inside the Obama administration, some officials say they fear any crackdown on Iranian oil exports could drive up oil prices when the United States and European economies are weak. As one senior official put it, \"You don't want to tip the U.S. into a downturn just to punish the Iranians.\"<\/p><p>Senior administration officials, who would not speak publicly about internal negotiations over the sanctions, say no recommendation on acting against the central bank has gone to Mr. Obama, who vowed last week to make sure Iran would face the \"toughest sanctions\" for what he said was its role in the sensational scheme to hire a Mexican drug cartel to kill the Saudi envoy.<\/p><p>The decision to press the International Atomic Energy Agency was brewing even before the plot against the Saudi ambassador was discovered, but that discovery prompted the White House to pursue a full-court, public press of the agency to release the sensitive intelligence.<\/p><p>Officials familiar with the evidence say it creates extraordinarily uncomfortable questions for the Iranians to answer, but does not definitively point to the construction of a weapon. Instead, it details work on individual technologies essential for designing and detonating a nuclear device, including how to turn uranium into bomb fuel, how to cast conventional explosives in a shape that can set off a nuclear blast, and how to make detonators, generate neutrons to spur a chain reaction, measure detonation waves and make nose cones for missiles.<\/p><p>Tommy Vietor, the spokesman for the National Security Council, said Saturday that \"the United States believes that a comprehensive assessment would be invaluable for the international community in its consideration of Iran's nuclear program and what to do about it.\" Iran has declared that all of the documents suggesting work on how to create a weapon that could fit atop an Iranian missile are \"fabrications\" intended to justify an attack. The country has been the target of covert attacks, including the assassinations of some nuclear scientists and a computer worm that disabled some of Iran's nuclear centrifuges.<\/p><p>The Obama administration, since coming to office, has never publicly presented detailed evidence to back up its claim that Iran is driving toward a weapon or creating the technology to assemble one quickly, should it need it. But it has discussed the evidence widely with allies.<\/p><p>In part the administration has hesitated to discuss the evidence because, after the failure to find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq in 2003, any American evidence is considered suspect. Widespread questions about the plot against the Saudis last week underscored how deep those suspicions run.<\/p><p>But Iran is a different kind of case. Inspectors visit regularly, measuring Iran's output of uranium, including recent production of the material, enriched to 20 percent purity, that takes it far closer to the kind of fuel needed for a weapon. Iran said recently that it would produce more of the 20 percent enriched material than it needs for a small medical research reactor, which prompted new concerns that it is building a stockpile that could be converted to weapons use.","109":"Jim Herron Zamora, Chronicle Staff Writer<\/p><p>Larry and Muriel fight back tears as they leave the courthouse after hearing that their son Darren Ray was found the guilty of killing Terrance Kelly, Wednesday Oct. 11, 2006, in Martinez, Ca.

Within six weeks of the firing on Fort Sumter, Gen. Benjamin Butler was forced to decide what to do with three slaves who escaped to Fortress Monroe on the north shore of Virginia's James River. Butler, certainly no abolitionist, nonetheless refused to return the three to their owner, labeling them \"contrabands of war.\"<\/p><p>The term, suitably ambiguous for an administration that as yet had no policy on how to handle the fugitives, found immediate acceptance. As one Union officer wrote, \"Never was a word so speedily adopted by so many people in so short a time.\" Within weeks hundreds of \"contrabands\" \u2014 men, women and children \u2014 flocked to Fortress Monroe and other Union Army positions. Unsure what might greet them, the escaped slaves were yet confident that life under federal control must surely represent an improvement.<\/p><p>It took the federal government more than a year to devise a policy in answer to this thirst for freedom. In August 1861, the First Confiscation Act stripped slaveholders of their claim of ownership, but it failed to clarify whether the slaves were themselves free. The following March Congress prohibited the military from sending escaped slaves back into slavery, and in July the Second Confiscation Act decreed that all slaves that took refuge in Union areas were \"captives of war\" and would be set free.<\/p><p>These legislative actions took on ever greater significance as Union forces moved deeper and deeper into Confederate territory. The growing number of contrabands reaching federal lines necessitated the establishment of dozens of impromptu contraband camps. A draft map compiled by the National Park Service illustrates how the network of these generally transitory camps mirrored the advance of the Union Army along the Mississippi, Tennessee and Cumberland River systems. Grant's Army of the Tennessee spent the summer of 1862 protecting supply lines in western Tennessee and northern Mississippi. Victories at the Battle of Iuka in September and the Battle of Corinth in early October solidified Union control of the area.<\/p><p>Lincoln's announcement of the preliminary Emancipation Proclamation on Sept. 22, 1862, produced an even greater flood of refugees. How best to use and care for these contrabands proved particularly vexing for military leaders under Grant's command. \"You have no idea of the consternation Old Abe's Proclamation is making,\" wrote Gen. Grenville Dodge to his brother in September. The contrabands \"will not even wait until 1st January. I do not know what we shall do with them.\"<\/p><p>Many of these fugitives arrived in an appalling condition. \"There were men, women, and children in every stage of disease or decrepitude often nearly naked, with flesh torn by the terrible experiences of their escape,\" wrote one observer. \"Often the slaves met prejudices against their color more bitter than any they had left behind.\"<\/p><p>On Nov. 11, 1862, Grant took the first step toward addressing the crisis: he named John Eaton, a former high school principal and chaplain of the 27th Ohio Infantry, as superintendent of contrabands and set him at work \"organizing them into suitable companies for working.\" A month later he went further. \"The negroes will be clothed, and in every way provided for, out of their earnings\" \u2014 about 12.5 cents for each pound of cotton picked \u2014 \"so far as practicable,\" he ordered. \"In no case will negroes be forced into the service of the Government, or be enticed away from their homes except when it becomes a military necessity.\"<\/p><p>Grant's policies lent the contraband camps an official status and began to define what a freedman could and could not do once within the Union lines. Personally, Grant appears to have had no particular sympathy for the refugees. He seems to have recognized that, in the words of one observer, \"The soldiers of our army were a good deal opposed to serving the Negro in any manner.\" Nevertheless, the Union commander unreservedly supported Eaton's work and in the process enabled the creation of one of the war's most successful contraband camps, located at Corinth, Miss.<\/p><p>Although formally organized under the direction of General Dodge in early December 1862 and placed under the command of James M. Alexander, chaplain of the 66th Illinois, the Corinth camp likely came into existence as early as September. Initially housed in army tents no longer considered serviceable for Union troops, the freedmen were soon set to work downing trees and clearing land on which to build cabins and lay out streets, which were named for Union generals. Eventually the freedmen also built a four-room school, a commissary, a hospital, a church and an office. The entire camp was divided into wards, complete with ward masters and a police force.<\/p><p>In late 1862 the American Missionary Association sent its first volunteers to Corinth to help care for, educate and minister to the freedmen. In a memoir written years after the war, one such missionary recalled her experience. \"When brought face to face with the slaves,\" she wrote, \"it was like the discovery of a new race.\" The men and women who came to Corinth generally shared a paternalistic optimism and viewed the freedmen as childlike in their enthusiasm for both education and salvation.<\/p><p>The freedmen's thirst for knowledge was undeniable. \"You will find them every hour of daylight, at their books,\" observed the Rev. Edward Pierce in March of 1863. \"We cannot enter a cabin, or tent, but that we see from one to three with books.\" Within no time Pierce and his wife had more than 150 students, and by the end of the summer, the addition of more missionaries enabled the school to accommodate between 300 and 400 children as well as 60 adults at a night school. In August, one of the teachers estimated that as many as 1,000 freedmen had learned to read in the Corinth camp.<\/p><p>Organized religion followed closely on the heels of formal education.

He is co-editor of the book \"Deadline Artists: America's Greatest Newspaper Columns.\"<\/p><p>(CNN) -- Beneath Rick Santorum's stunning three-state sweep on Tuesday stands another stubborn sign of dissatisfaction with the status quo: Republican turnout is down.<\/p><p>I'm talking embarrassingly, disturbingly, hey-don't-you-know-it's-an-election-year bad. It is a sign of a serious enthusiasm gap among the rank and file, and a particularly bad omen for Mitt Romney and the GOP in the general election.<\/p><p>Here's the tale of the tape, state by state, beginning with Tuesday night: Minnesota had just more than 47,000 people turn out for its caucuses this year -- four years ago it was nearly 63,000 -- and Romney came in first, not a distant third as he did Tuesday night. In Colorado, more than 70,000 people turned out for its caucus in 2008 -- but in 2012 it was 65,000. And Missouri -- even making a generous discount for the fact that this was an entirely symbolic contest -- had 232,000 people turn out, less than half the number who did four years ago.<\/p><p>Even with months of pre-primary hype and attention solely devoted to the Republican field, turnout in this election cycle essentially flat-lined. In Iowa, a little more than 121,000 people voted, compared with nearly 119,000 four years before, when action in the Democratic caucuses absorbed most of the attention.<\/p><p>In New Hampshire, the same dynamic applied -- 245,000 voters turned out in 2012, compared with 241,000 four years before, despite Republicans being the only game in town and independents making up 47% of the total turnout in 2012, according to CNN exit polls. Take out the independent voters and you've got a deep net decline.<\/p><p>Always proudly rebellious, South Carolina has been the great outlier in this election cycle. With Newt Gingrich making an all-out push for conservatives in a conservative state, turnout was up almost 150,000 over four years before.<\/p><p>But in Florida, the decline became unmistakable. Maybe it decreased because the Romney and Gingrich campaigns, plus super PACS, spent more than $18 million in the Sunshine State on TV ads, of which 93% were negative in the last week alone, according to the Campaign Media Analysis Group. After all, negative ads depress turnout. But after all the mud was thrown, 1.6 million people turned out in the nation's fourth largest state, which might sound impressive until you compare it with the nearly 2 million who turned out in 2008.<\/p><p>Nevada was even worse, with 32,894 people turning out to vote in a state with more than 465,000 registered Republicans. Four years before, more than 44,300 participated in the caucus. Turnout was down more than 25% despite the GOP caucuses being the only game in town. Party officials were expecting a turnout of more than 70,000.<\/p><p>All this should be a wake-up call for the GOP. Despite an enormous amount of national media attention devoted to each of the states to date, the response has been a notable yawn among the Republican rank and file.<\/p><p>The turnout numbers are even worse when you compare them with the number of registered Republicans in each state that has voted to date.<\/p><p>The caucuses in particular bring out an unrepresentative sample of a state's Republican Party. For all the grass-roots romanticism, there has got to be a better way to pick a presidential nominee.<\/p><p>But the news is worst for Romney, long the presumptive front-runner in a party that tends to reward the man next in line.<\/p><p>\"Reluctantly Romney\" could be a bumper sticker, even for his supporters. The former Massachusetts governor has found it difficult to climb above 35% in national polls, meaning that a majority of Republicans still support someone else in a notably weak field. His vote margins and totals lag behind those of four years before, when he lost the nomination to John McCain in a crowded and comparatively competent field, although Minnesota is the first state he won in '08 and lost in 2012.<\/p><p>You reap what you sow, and part of the reason turnout is down is directly related to the problem of polarization. The Republican Party is more ideologically polarized than at any time in recent history. Therefore, it put up more purely right-wing candidates than it did four years before, when center-right leaders such as McCain and Rudy Giuliani were also in the race. A bigger tent inspired bigger turnout.<\/p><p>But the other reason is simple dissatisfaction with the candidates.<\/p><p>Republicans seem united in their anger against the president -- like the Democrats in 2004 -- but they are uninspired by their options. Draft movements for fantasy candidates ranging from Chris Christie to Mitch Daniels to Paul Ryan and even Jeb Bush have started and failed. Some party leaders show more enthusiasm for a hypothetical 2016 crop of candidates, including Marco Rubio and Bobby Jindal, than they do for the flawed choices before them in this election. Divided and dispirited is an odd place for the Republican Party to be so soon after the enthusiasms of the 2010 tea party-driven election.<\/p><p>The bottom line is that voter turnout matters. And what should be most troubling for Republicans is that this enthusiasm gap among the conservative base is accompanied by a lack of candidates who might appeal to independents and centrist swing voters in the general election. It is a double barrel of bad news for the Republican Party. The numbers can be spun and rationalized by professional partisan operatives all day long, but the fact remains -- voters just aren't turning out to cast their votes for this crop of conservative candidates in 2012.<\/p><p>Follow CNN Opinion on Twitter.<\/p><p>Join the conversation on Facebook.<\/p><p>The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John Avlon.","113":"While living in an apartment in Pentagon City, Stephanie Gimenez Stahlberg and her husband, Patrick Stahlberg, a software engineer, began searching for a house where they could raise their family.<\/p><p>With two children \u2014 now 31\/2 and 1 1\/2 \u2014 the Stahlbergs needed more space, including a study area for Stephanie, who is enrolled in a PhD program at the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies.<\/p><p>The house they found in Cherrydale, a neighborhood in North Arlington, met their expectations. Within two days on the market, however, there were 10 offers. \"Our was not the highest,\" Stephanie said. \"We wrote a letter to the owners about why we liked the house.\"<\/p><p>The letter, along with a photograph of the family, worked. What drew the Stahlbergs to the house were the solar panels and the trees and bushes \u2014 raspberries, blueberries, blackberries, strawberries, grapes, apples, plums and currants \u2014 growing organically on the property. The Stahlbergs also envisioned finishing the basement bedroom and bathroom for an au pair.<\/p><p>They also fell in love with the neighborhood. They would be within walking distance to a park and two libraries with story time for children.<\/p><p>\"We were trying to look at homes where we can walk to the Metro, or bike to the city or to the Metro,\" said Stephanie, 27.<\/p><p>Sears and Montgomery Ward kit houses: Cherrydale, once abundant with cherry orchards, is a family neighborhood dating to 1893. While many neighbors have lived in the area for as long as 60 years, newcomers move in and out these days, said Kathryn Holt Springston, who worked for the Smithsonian American History Tours Office as an educational specialist and historian for 28 years. She also served as curator and director of the Arlington Historical Museum and editor of the Cherrydale Citizens' Association newsletter.<\/p><p>Single-family homes, the Arlington public schools, access to bike trails and proximity to the District draw people to the neighborhood. Sometimes, though, they move in but stay only a few years. Finding a house in Cherrydale can involve the competitive process the Stahlbergs experienced.<\/p><p>About half a mile north of the Virginia Square and Ballston Metro stations on the Orange and Silver lines, Cherrydale has a variety of residences ranging from farmhouses to bungalows to Sears and Montgomery Ward kit homes with two to five or bedrooms or sometimes more. Many date from 1900 to 1930, though some of the older houses were purchased to be torn down and replaced with larger homes, including some built as recently as this year.<\/p><p>Living there: Cherrydale lies north of Interstate 66 and south of Lorcom Lane, stretching roughly from Utah Street on the west to the northward-curving interstate on the east. The Maywood neighborhood claims the eastern half of those boundaries north of Lee Highway, lending something of an arrowhead shape to Cherrydale. Since 1908, the Cherrydale Citizens' Association has planned activities and resolved neighborhood concerns. In the 1970s and 1980s, people often referred to the neighborhood as Mayberry, according to Springston, 63. In 1948, her parents bought the house where she lives with her husband and son. It dates to 1890, Springston said.<\/p><p>In the neighborhood, 49 properties sold in the past year, according to Billy Buck, an associate broker at Buck & Associates. The lowest priced was a one-bedroom, one-bath condominium for $200,000; the highest priced was a five-bedroom, five-bath farmhouse at $1.63 million. Twelve properties are on the market now, ranging from a one-bedroom, two-bath condo for $274,900 to a new five-bedroom, five-bath Craftsman house at $1.799 million.<\/p><p>Welcome wagon: The five-points intersection \u2014 Lee Highway, Old Dominion Drive, Quincy Street, Military Road and Quebec Street \u2014 is dotted with at least two car dealerships and other commercial establishments while nearby is a Safeway and the Cherrydale Hardware, which opened in 1938.<\/p><p>The Cherrydale Volunteer Fire House, built in 1919, is home to such events as the annual spaghetti dinner, concerts and for 90 years each December there is a visit from Santa Claus for children under 12. Other community events are the annual Fourth of July party and picnic at 21st and Stafford streets. A neighborhood with its own \"welcome wagon,\" Cherrydale has approximately 1,400 households and three parks as well as the Martha Custis Trail for biking, running and walking.<\/p><p>Schools: Glebe Elementary, Taylor Elementary, Swanson Middle, Kenmore Middle and Washington-Lee High.<\/p><p>Transit: The neighborhood is close to the Virginia Square or Ballston Metro stops on the Orange and Silver lines. Metro and Arlington Transit buses connect at Ballston and Virginia Square. Capital Bikeshare also is available.<\/p><p>Crime: From July 2014 through June 2015, according to Arlington County police, one robbery and two burglaries were reported in the area.<\/p><p>Harriet Edleson is a freelance writer.","114":"WASHINGTON \u2014 President Obama is pressing United Nations nuclear inspectors to release classified intelligence information showing that Iran is designing and experimenting with nuclear weapons technology. The president's push is part of a larger American effort to further isolate and increase pressure on Iran after accusing it of a plot to assassinate Saudi Arabia's ambassador to the United States.<\/p><p>If the United Nations' watchdog group agrees to publicize the evidence, including new data from recent months, it would almost certainly revive a debate that has been dormant during the Arab Spring about how aggressively the United States and its allies, including Israel, should move to halt Iran's suspected weapons program.<\/p><p>Over the longer term, several senior Obama administration officials said in interviews, they are mulling a ban on financial transactions with Iran's central bank \u2014 a move that has been opposed by China and other Asian nations. Also being considered is an expansion of the ban on the purchase of petroleum products sold by companies controlled by the country's elite military force, the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps.<\/p><p>The Revolutionary Guards are also believed to oversee the military side of the nuclear program, and they are the parent of the Quds Force, which Washington has accused of directing the assassination plot.<\/p><p>The proposed sanctions come as administration officials confront skepticism around the world about their allegations that Iran was behind the plot and limited options about what they can do \u2014 as well as growing pressure from Republicans and some Democrats in Congress to take tougher action against Iran, with the central bank and the oil industry high on lawmakers' lists.<\/p><p>All of the proposed sanctions carry with them considerable political and economic risks. Yukiya Amano, the cautious director general of the United Nations group, the International Atomic Energy Agency, talked publicly in September about publishing some of the most delicate data suggesting Iran worked on nuclear triggers and warheads. But officials who have spoken with him say he is concerned that his inspectors could be ejected from Iran, shutting the best, though narrow, window into its nuclear activities.<\/p><p>Similarly, China and Russia, among other major Iranian trading partners, have resisted further oil and financial sanctions, saying the goal of isolating Iran is a poor strategy. Even inside the Obama administration, some officials say they fear any crackdown on Iranian oil exports could drive up oil prices when the United States and European economies are weak. As one senior official put it, \"You don't want to tip the U.S. into a downturn just to punish the Iranians.\"<\/p><p>Senior administration officials, who would not speak publicly about internal negotiations over the sanctions, say no recommendation on acting against the central bank has gone to Mr. Obama, who vowed last week to make sure Iran would face the \"toughest sanctions\" for what he said was its role in the sensational scheme to hire a Mexican drug cartel to kill the Saudi envoy.<\/p><p>The decision to press the International Atomic Energy Agency was brewing even before the plot against the Saudi ambassador was discovered, but that discovery prompted the White House to pursue a full-court, public press of the agency to release the sensitive intelligence.<\/p><p>Officials familiar with the evidence say it creates extraordinarily uncomfortable questions for the Iranians to answer, but does not definitively point to the construction of a weapon. Instead, it details work on individual technologies essential for designing and detonating a nuclear device, including how to turn uranium into bomb fuel, how to cast conventional explosives in a shape that can set off a nuclear blast, and how to make detonators, generate neutrons to spur a chain reaction, measure detonation waves and make nose cones for missiles.<\/p><p>Tommy Vietor, the spokesman for the National Security Council, said Saturday that \"the United States believes that a comprehensive assessment would be invaluable for the international community in its consideration of Iran's nuclear program and what to do about it.\" Iran has declared that all of the documents suggesting work on how to create a weapon that could fit atop an Iranian missile are \"fabrications\" intended to justify an attack. The country has been the target of covert attacks, including the assassinations of some nuclear scientists and a computer worm that disabled some of Iran's nuclear centrifuges.<\/p><p>The Obama administration, since coming to office, has never publicly presented detailed evidence to back up its claim that Iran is driving toward a weapon or creating the technology to assemble one quickly, should it need it. But it has discussed the evidence widely with allies.<\/p><p>In part the administration has hesitated to discuss the evidence because, after the failure to find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq in 2003, any American evidence is considered suspect. Widespread questions about the plot against the Saudis last week underscored how deep those suspicions run.<\/p><p>But Iran is a different kind of case. Inspectors visit regularly, measuring Iran's output of uranium, including recent production of the material, enriched to 20 percent purity, that takes it far closer to the kind of fuel needed for a weapon. Iran said recently that it would produce more of the 20 percent enriched material than it needs for a small medical research reactor, which prompted new concerns that it is building a stockpile that could be converted to weapons use.","115":"Despite the firestorm over his comments about rape and pregnancy, Representative Todd Akin says he has no plans to drop out as the Republican Senate nominee in Missouri.<\/p><p>But what if he did?<\/p><p>The procedures in Missouri to change nominees midstream are complicated and intended to discourage just the sort of change that many in the Republican Party say they are eager to see happen.<\/p><p>\"As more time passes, you're starting to go up against deadlines,\" said Stacie Temple, a spokeswoman for Missouri's secretary of state, Robin Carnahan, a Democrat.

Mr. Carnahan's name nonetheless appeared on the ballot in November \u2014 and he won.

But Ms. Carnahan is herself a factor in Republican minds. As the Democratic Senate nominee in 2010, she lost to Representative Roy Blunt, and Republicans imagine she could put up a fight.<\/p><p>\"The secretary's job is to protect the rights of Missouri voters,\" Ms. Temple said when asked whether Ms. Carnahan would fight a court order to remove Mr. Akin's name from the ballot.<\/p><p>A further complication: Under state law, any election authority in Missouri can oppose a withdrawal order, down to the county and city level, and there are Democrats aplenty in Missouri. But Ms. Temple added that right now, it would be up to a Missouri court to determine whether Mr. Akin could withdraw, not the secretary of state.<\/p><p>\"It's completely in the hands of the court to decide the facts,\" she said.<\/p><p>Assuming Mr. Akin does manage to drop out, the state central committee of the Republican Party in Missouri would have to pick a new candidate within 28 days, or by Oct. 12, whichever comes first.","116":"Some things are more important than football, and Leah Still is doing something that's much harder than anything that can be done on a football field.<\/p><p>Former Cincinnati Bengals defensive lineman Devon Still announced on Instagram that his daughter Leah is cancer-free.<\/p><p>Leah Still, 5, was diagnosed with cancer in June 2014 and given a 50-50 chance to live.<\/p><p>The Bengals kept Still on their practice squad after cutting him last year, according to SI.com, and he eventually made the active roster and appeared in 12 games.<\/p><p>Still again was cut in September and is currently a free agent, but he'll take Leah kicking cancer over signing with a team any day.<\/p><p>More from The Sports Daily:","117":"NEW YORK -- Ruben Tejada thinks Chase Utley's late slide that broke his right leg was dirty.<\/p><p>Speaking about the play for the first time since Utley ended Tejada's season in Game 2 of the NL Division Series against the Los Angeles Dodgers, the Mets shortstop said he's no longer upset over it.<\/p><p>Using a blue cane adorned with a Mets logo giving to him by the team's owners, Tejada hung out with teammates in the dugout before Game 4 of the World Series.<\/p><p>He says he's come to terms with what happened, even though he never responded to the message Utley sent him through captain David Wright.

It's a sci-fi showpiece. It's an ultralight carbon-fiber production car. It's a triumph of parts-bin engineering. It's a take-no-prisoners canyon racer. It's a winged chariot of the Malibu \u00fcber-chic. It's a $136,625 (destination included!) commuter car for Silicon Valley moguls.<\/p><p>The hardware, at least, is straightforward. The central passenger shell is a stiff, lightweight carbon-fiber structure. It is bolted to an aluminum skeleton that holds the 7.1-kilowatt-hour lithium-ion battery pack in its spine.<\/p><p>An electric drive section similar to the one in the BMW i3 people pod is bolted to the front, its 131 horsepower electric motor and 2-speed automatic transmission driving the front wheels. The rear power package is sourced from the new Mini; its 3-cylinder, twin-turbocharged 231-horsepower engine drives the rear wheels through a 6-speed automatic transmission.<\/p><p>The multilayered skin is molded thermoplastic that weighs half as much as steel. Other extreme weight-saving measures, including aluminum wiring and chemically hardened ultrathin glass, keep the weight to 3,267 pounds. The long, light doors swing up and forward. From the front, with doors open, the i8 looks as if it's signaling a touchdown.<\/p><p>The interior is compact yet comfortable, though those over 6-foot-2 may need more legroom, and the rear seats are designed for tiny, limber people.<\/p><p>Getting in is a challenge. The sill is wide, the seat is low, and there's a trick: sit sideways, slide butt in, retract legs. Getting out? Imagine climbing from a bathtub without using your hands.<\/p><p>Pick a personality with the driving-mode buttons. \"Comfort\" keeps the car in electric mode to 37 m.p.h., or until you mash the right-side pedal. The eDrive button keeps things electric to 75 m.p.h. or until the battery fades.<\/p><p>Travel range is about 20 miles in E.V. mode, and recharging takes 1.5 hours at 240 volts or four hours at 120. The Eco-Pro button increases electric efficiency 20 percent by softening the motor response and optimizing climate-control settings. I observed gasoline-powered mileage figures from 27 m.p.g. (impatient cornering) to 37 m.p.g. (safe-and-sane commuting).<\/p><p>In the city, the i8 feels silent, solid and intuitive \u2014 the excitement happens outside, as gawkers track its progress.<\/p><p>On Los Angeles's well-used freeways, the Comfort setting leaves some comfort to be desired. Even with the variable dampers at full soft, the i8 bobs its nose like Muhammad Ali in the first rounds. High-performance tires come standard in the United States; European versions get narrower wheels and taller tires for lower drag and a smoother ride.<\/p><p>In Sport mode, the suspension and steering stiffen and the gas engine roars, pops on upshifts and matches revs downshifting into corners. It sounds great, and it should: much of what you hear is a prerecorded soundtrack piped through the sound system.<\/p><p>The i8 feels strong at full power, but the head-snapping response expected from a partly electric powertrain is absent. The i8 takes time to gather itself, with an atavistic vestige of turbo lag.<\/p><p>On the intestinal twists of Mulholland Highway the i8 can be driven with brutal abandon. The brakes are strong, the chassis is as stiff as a bank vault, and there's enough power to reach the next corner presently. BMW claims a 0-to-60 time of 4.2 seconds, and top speed is 155 m.p.h.<\/p><p>The front tires push when going hard into corners, but everything sticks coming out. Even with the stability control off, the i8 resists spinning its tires \u2014 the software ghost is still there, lurking in the machine.<\/p><p>The i8 is complicated and imperfect. A car that will be used for emissions-free commuting should allow people to get in and get out. It rides harshly.

As the Democratic Senate nominee in 2010, she lost to Representative Roy Blunt, and Republicans imagine she could put up a fight.<\/p><p>\"The secretary's job is to protect the rights of Missouri voters,\" Ms. Temple said when asked whether Ms. Carnahan would fight a court order to remove Mr. Akin's name from the ballot.<\/p><p>A further complication: Under state law, any election authority in Missouri can oppose a withdrawal order, down to the county and city level, and there are Democrats aplenty in Missouri. But Ms. Temple added that right now, it would be up to a Missouri court to determine whether Mr. Akin could withdraw, not the secretary of state.<\/p><p>\"It's completely in the hands of the court to decide the facts,\" she said.<\/p><p>Assuming Mr. Akin does manage to drop out, the state central committee of the Republican Party in Missouri would have to pick a new candidate within 28 days, or by Oct. 12, whichever comes first.","122":"\"We don't want people coming back or visiting,\" Nugent said.

Recently, the Los Angeles based-comedian started working one very personal, serious experience into her routine.<\/p><p>on Monday to open up about a violent relationship with an ex boyfriend, sharing photos of her bruised arms and legs and explaining why she has decided to include discussions of the abuse in her stand-up.<\/p><p>\"Same girl in all of these photos (me). I've had an amazing year, and you've seen the highlights here, so these photos are an uncommon thing to share but not an uncommon issue,\" Stelling captions a collage of photos of her bruises and her onstage smile.<\/p><p>The comic, who released her album<\/p><p>this fall and has a Comedy Central special, was hesitant to openly talk about the abuse, especially within her professional world.<\/p><p>\"There are many reasons not to make an abusive relationship public, mostly fear. Scared of what people will think, scared it makes me look weak or unprofessional,\" she writes.<\/p><p>\"When friends or comics ask why we broke up, it's not easy or comfortable to reply; it doesn't seem like the appropriate thing to say at a stand-up show, a party or a wedding. It's embarrassing. I feel stupid. After being verbally, physically abused and raped, I dated him for two more months. It's not simple.\"<\/p><p>Ultimately, Stelling couldn't exclude such a significant piece of her story from her onstage persona, even if it meant risking ridicule from the close-knit comedy community.<\/p><p>\"After I broke up with him, he said, 'You're very open and honest in your stand-up, and I just ask that you consider me when you talk about your ex because everyone knows who you're talking about.' And I abided. I wrote vague jokes because we both live in L.A., and I didn't want to hurt him, start a war, press charges, be interrogated or harassed by him or his friends and family. I wanted to move on and forget because I didn't understand,\" Stelling shares.<\/p><p>\"I don't want revenge or to hurt him now, but it's unhealthy to keep this inside because my stand-up is pulled directly from my life. It's how I make my living. My personal is my professional. That is how I've always been; I make dark, funny. So now I'm allowing this to be part of my story.\"<\/p><p>Stelling says she's already started joking about the relationship and asked her followers to \"have the courage to listen and accept.\"<\/p><p>So far, the funny lady has been getting a positive response to her openness at the mic.<\/p><p>\"Already since talking about this onstage, many women have come to me after shows asking me to keep doing it,\" she says on Instagram. \"Men have shown their solidarity.\"","124":"Kenneth Ng calls his website a primer for tourists headed to<\/p><p>, but Fodor's it ain't.<\/p><p>The California State University at Northridge professor's site is a one-stop shop for men drawn to the country's sex tourism industry. Dotted with pictures of scantily clad women, the website, BigBabyKenny, advises would-be Johns on the art of negotiating with prostitutes. \"Start with a compliment,\" Ng advises.<\/p><p>Needless to say, Ng's website is causing headaches for Northridge administrators. First publicized by the Los Angeles Daily News, the economics professor's site has drawn a wave of unwelcome attention, forcing administrators to at once criticize its content and defend Ng's right to publish freely on his own time without university resources.<\/p><p>\"Until we find representative evidence that it infringes upon the work he does at the university itself, there's not much we can do about it,\" said Harold Hellenbrand, Northridge's provost.<\/p><p>There may be subtlety in Hellenbrand's words, but his message is clear: If BigBabyKenny infringes on Ng's ability to effectively do his job, then Northridge's position will change. Ng has already said his site is run through a separate server not connected to the university, but Northridge officials might still make a case that the site has interfered with his job. Asked if students complaining that they were no longer comfortable in Ng's class would compel Northridge to demand the site be taken down, Hellenbrand said \"I'm not inviting complaints, but you just hit on the key issue.\"<\/p><p>\"If [running the site is] what he wants to do, and at the same time he wants to educate students and students flock away, then that would create a problem,\" Hellenbrand said.<\/p><p>How Ng came to be identified as the author of BigBabyKenny is a story in itself. A frequent tourist of Thailand, Ng took to blogging on the website of a Bangkok bar called Big Mango Bar. In one controversial post, Ng advised men to seek women near a particular Buddhist shrine.<\/p><p>\"The naysayers will say its creepy to be hanging around the Muariti Shrine, hitting on the emotionally vulnerable girls desperately praying and paying Buddha for a better love life but I beg to differ. Buddha works in mysterious ways,\" he wrote.<\/p><p>Perturbed by the post, the bar owners removed it. That led Ng to start his own site, prompting what Ng describes as a concerted effort by the owners to publicize his penchant for writing about prostitutes. They sent mass e-mails to faculty listed in Northridge's directory, and also posted on RateMyProfessor.com, warning students about Ng, he said.<\/p><p>Ng readily defends the content of his site and says he has no intention of taking it down.<\/p><p>\"The university has no stake in this one way or the other, and besides, professors can say whatever they want,\" said Ng, a tenured associate professor of economics.<\/p><p>Some question whether Ng has crossed a gray legal line, however, by advising men on sex tourism. Patrick Trueman, a former U.S. justice department official, notes that there are several federal statutes that could come into play. Within U.S. Code 18 are two sections \u2013 2422 (a) and 2422 (b) \u2013 that specifically prohibit anyone from \"enticing or coercing a person\" to travel internationally in pursuit of prostitutes. Moreover, one section specifically prohibits the use of the Internet to lure people.<\/p><p>While prostitution may be tolerated in Thailand, that's immaterial under the federal code, Trueman said.<\/p><p>\"Inducing and enticing? Isn't that what this guy's doing?\" said Trueman, former chief of the Justice Department's Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section in the Criminal Division.<\/p><p>Trueman, now a lawyer specializing in sex trafficking and child abuse cases, said there would likely be debate about whether talking about procuring prostitutes online and actually arranging prostitutes for a person should be treated differently under the law.<\/p><p>\"Given how lax the fed government is on these crimes, they may not charge somebody unless they are more directly involved,\" he said. \"That's not to say this person couldn't be charged, and as I read it they could be charged.\"<\/p><p>Beyond the legal implications, critics have already attacked Ng on moral grounds. John Foubert, an Oklahoma State University professor who researches sex trafficking, argues that women \u2013 often minors \u2013 are forced into the sex tourism industry and often have trouble escaping it. Even if Ng is operating within the bounds of the law, Northridge officials have an ethical problem they've yet to face, Foubert said.<\/p><p>\"Do they want to live with the blood on their hands of these girls that are being essentially raped by these men, who are going down and purchasing sex? I think that's a larger question,\" said Foubert, an associate professor of college student development.<\/p><p>Ng said he allows anything to be written on his site, so long as it doesn't involve pedophilia or underage sex. He does, however, write about how difficult it is to effectively negotiate with a \"half or sometimes fully naked teenage girl\" when she's \"expertly gyrating\" on a man's lap.<\/p><p>While his critics have been speaking out since fall, Ng said he has yet to hear from a student who expressed discomfort about his website.<\/p><p>\"The job of the university is to expose students to the world \u2013 not just a politically correct view of the world and not just the good parts of the world,\" he said. \"If a student reads that [site], I personally think it's good for them. They learn about something out there; maybe they disapprove of it and they don't think it's good.\"<\/p><p>You share in the USA TODAY community, so please keep your comments smart and civil.

In its seventh edition, this annual festival of contemporary performance announces itself boldly, its name projected in big block letters on the facade of Abrons Arts Center, home to most of the festival's 18 boundary-blurring productions.<\/p><p>It doesn't take much to inject new life into an event sometimes at risk of stagnating, even as it champions the fresh, the unseen, the unexpected. At opening night on Thursday, visitors were guided from show to show through stairwells and hallways generally closed to the public. For anyone well acquainted with Abrons, as many Realness-goers are, this proved a simple, effective way to reinvent familiar spaces.<\/p><p>Masterminded by Thomas Benjamin Snapp Pryor, Realness coincides with the citywide conference of the Association of Performing Arts Presenters \u2014 international curators and producers in the market for new work \u2014 which returns each year like a recurring dream, or nightmare, depending on your relationship to the idea of shopping for live art. Last year's festival was full of work bemoaning the economic plight of performers; this year's first two productions struck out in less sullen directions, while still folding in some self-reflexive critique (also available in the form of Realness swag declaring, \"I Suffer From Realness\").<\/p><p>First was \"Culture Administration & Trembling,\" a biodiverse collaboration among the performers Jennifer Lacey, Antonija Livingstone, Dominique P\u00e9trin and Stephen Thompson. Ticket holders were instructed to remove their shoes, then led to the second floor of the arts complex, where a usually drab lobby had been transformed with geometric and botanical designs on the floor and walls.<\/p><p>Ms. Lacey, Ms. Livingstone, Mr. Thompson and Dana Michel crawled languidly around the asymmetrical room, the audience huddled around the perimeter, to a soundscape of intermittent bird song. Ms. P\u00e9trin appeared just as calmly immersed in her task of adorning the ground with origami squares. Three live snakes, delivered from offstage, soon joined in. Humans and reptiles slid over and around one another.<\/p><p>This was just the first of many tenuously related, increasingly chaotic episodes, including the arrival of two Chihuahuas (the snakes, not to worry, had exited) and a migration into the adjacent black-box theater for a ritualistic ringing of hand-held bells. A mysterious voice, accompanying a video projection, pronounced, \"This piece will not save us.\" Ms. Lacey, cradling a small, three-legged dog while bending and stretching her limbs, told a story about an artist and an institution (Realness, perhaps) trying to spice up their relationship like old lovers. What to do with all this information? I thought of dance as undomesticated wildlife, of the predators and prey involved in buying and selling performance.<\/p><p>Down one set of stairs and up another, in a tucked-away dance studio not often used for performances, the choreographer Heather Kravas, visiting from Seattle, offered the New York premiere of \"dead, disappears.\" Ms. Kravas was her own predator and protector in this stark, self-punishing solo, as she put herself through perilous paces inspired by the sculptor Richard Serra's \"Verb List,\" a series of actions that he associated with making his pieces.<\/p><p>What seemed at first like arbitrary acts of masochism \u2014 walking on tiptoe with a trash bag over her head while barking two-syllable phrases \u2014 deepened into a formidable exploration of language, the female body and the power play between them. Having duct-taped a pillow to a chair, as if it were a prisoner, Ms. Kravas pounded it with a long pole, shouting a list of alphabetized verbs, one per swipe. By the end, in whatever this struggle had been, she had secured the upper hand.<\/p><p>American Realness continues through Jan. 17.

The company currently supplies their weapons to 17,800 of the United States' roughly 18,000 law enforcement agencies.<\/p><p>The brand name Taser has become as synonymous with these devices as Kleenex or Xerox have to photocopies and tissues \u2013 a quirk of language known as a \"proprietary eponym\". The word has even become a verb, as people commonly speak of being \"Tased\" or \"Tasered\".<\/p><p>The word Taser, though, didn't start with the company: it's actually a loose acronym of the book Tom Swift and His Electric Rifle. Jack Cover, the inventor of the modern ECD, named his prototype after the YA sci-fi novel he loved, and the very idea for a less-lethal electric gun was largely inspired by the fictional one described in the book.<\/p><p>And while this quirky history is known among some in law enforcement and engineering circles, the innocence with which it's told \u2013 a curious inventor culling inspiration from the literature of his youth \u2013 belies a more sinister truth: the book itself is boldly racist.<\/p><p>Tom Swift and His Electric Rifle, published in New York in 1911 under the pen name Victor Appleton, is typical of the literature of its time: an imperialist adventure tale set against the backdrop of a wild and dark African continent. In it, the protagonist, Tom Swift, develops an electric rifle \u2013 a totally novel idea in 1911 \u2013 and decides to test it in Africa in the hunt for ivory.<\/p><p>Africa, in the context of the book, exists only as a frontier of underexploited resources ripe for the wealth accumulation of white men daring enough to attempt. \"Elephant shooting in Africa! My! With my new electric rifle ... what a fellow couldn't do in the dark continent!\"<\/p><p>\"With the price of ivory soaring,\" says Swift's veteran hunting companion, \"there's a chance for us all to get a lot of money.\"<\/p><p>While this unabashed entrepreneurial imperialism tends to read as a relic of a bygone age, today disproportionately white police departments in places like Ferguson, Missouri, often function similarly as the adventurers sent to do the dangerous work of this kind of wealth generation. Like in the book, black communities are often seen not as dynamic places where people live lives, but as sites for plunder.<\/p><p>Take, for example, the Department of Justice's March report on the prevalence of predatory, revenue-based policing in St Louis County: entire municipalities there, as elsewhere in the US, float their operating budgets and justify their own existence on the racially biased extraction of statutory fees from primarily black residents. This scheme has only begun to decline because of the protests and organizing that defined Ferguson in the wake of Mike Brown's death.<\/p><p>In the book, as in America today, the black people are rendered as either passive, simple and childlike, or animalistic and capable of unimaginable violence. They are described in the book at various points as \"hideous in their savagery, wearing only the loin cloth, and with their kinky hair stuck full of sticks\", and as \"wild, savage and ferocious ... like little red apes\".<\/p><p>Swift and his travel companions quickly determine the blacks, scarcely human, need to be controlled, guided or killed as determined by the more \"civilized\" white outsiders.<\/p><p>Consider then how quickly the black people of Ferguson were rendered something less than fully human in the wake of Mike Brown's killing: an on-duty Ferguson police officer, a former NYPD commissioner and a popular actor all spared no time in invoking the discourse of \"animals\" in reference to black protesters. Near and far, incredulous commentators sought to cast the police as the sole defenders of black communities, and the only thing standing between those communities and self-destruction.<\/p><p>\"White police officers wouldn't be there if you weren't killing each other,\" former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani said on Meet the Press last November. Echoing Swift's rank paternalism, he later added: \"I probably saved more black lives as mayor of New York City than any mayor in the history of this city.\"<\/p><p>In the book, when Swift and his companions proudly use their advanced weapons \u2013 particularly the electric rifle \u2013 to dispatch with an incoming buffalo stampede, they too happily celebrate themselves as saviors.<\/p><p>\"Had it not been for the white men, the native village, which consisted of only frail huts, would have been completely wiped out by the animals,\" the novel reads.<\/p><p>Being named after a racist book doesn't make a company or device racist, any more than a person being named after a racist relative makes them so. A name is just that \u2013 and a Taser on its face is no more racist than the city or state of Washington are, simply for being named after our slaveholding first president.<\/p><p>But as recent campus activism in places such as Harvard and Princeton have demonstrated, there is real value in coming to terms with the bigotry embedded in the seemingly innocuous names and symbols of even our most ordinary, and aspirationally colorblind, institutions.<\/p><p>Being aware of the history of the word Taser should make us pause and consider that, every day, predominantly white police officers walk into predominantly black communities armed with weapons first imagined in a book in which \"civilized\" whites entered the black wilds for the purpose of plunder, only to cast themselves as the saviors of the natives. It isn't meaningless that today that sequence sometimes appears to persist in reverse.","129":"MADRID (AP) \u2013 Spain's grinding economic misery will get worse this year despite the country's request for a European financial lifeline of up to $125 billion to save its banks, Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said Sunday.<\/p><p>A day after the country conceded it needed outside help following months of denying it would seek assistance, Rajoy said more Spaniards will lose their jobs in a country where one out of every four are already unemployed.<\/p><p>\"This year is going to be a bad one,\" Rajoy said Sunday in his first comments about the rescue since it was announced the previous evening by his economy minister.<\/p><p>The conservative prime minister added that the economy, stuck in its second recession in three years, will still contract the previously predicted 1.7 percent even with the help. Small businesses and families starving for credit will eventually get relief as the funding props up banks and they increase lending, but Rajoy didn't offer guidance on when.<\/p><p>Spain on Saturday became the fourth \u2014 and largest \u2014 of the 17 countries that use Europe's common currency to request a bailout \u2014 a big blow to a nation that a few years ago took pride as the continent's economic superstar only to see it become the hot spot in the eurozone debt crisis. Its economy is the eurozone's fourth largest after Germany, France and Italy.<\/p><p>Across the country, Spaniards reacted with a mixture of anger and relief to the news. The amount of the rescue fund, if all is tapped, amounts to \u20ac21,000 of new debt for each person in the nation of 47 million where the average annual salary for those with work is about the same amount and the unemployment rate for those under age 25 is 52 percent.<\/p><p>The country is already reeling from deep austerity cuts Rajoy has imposed over the last six months that have raised taxes, made it easier to hire and fire workers, and cut deep into cherished government programs including education and national health care.<\/p><p>\"It's obviously a shame,\" said civil servant Luisa Saraguren, 44, as she strolled on a sunny Sunday morning with her young daughter. \"But this bailout was fully predictable, and the consequences of this help are going to be a lot bigger compared to the cuts we've been living with already.\"<\/p><p>Rajoy took pains to avoid the word bailout Sunday, saying Spain's rescue package is a line of credit that its most troubled banks will be able to tap. The assistance will not come with the outside control over government macroeconomic policy like that imposed Greece, Ireland and Portugal when their public finances were bailed out.<\/p><p>He said interest rates on the loans will be considerably lower than the rate near 7 percent that Spain has been forced to pay recently on the international debt markets, a level that forced the other countries to seek bailouts.<\/p><p>Spain will regain the economic credibility it has lost by shoring up its banks, which will result in credit being restored so businesses and individuals shut off from loans can start borrowing and the economy will grow again, Rajoy insisted, again without saying when.<\/p><p>Europe's widening recession and financial crisis has hurt companies and investors around the world. Providing a financial lifeline to Spanish banks is likely to relieve anxiety on the Spanish economy \u2014 which is five times larger than Greece's \u2014 and on markets concerned about the country's ability to pay its way.<\/p><p>Spain's financial problems are not due to Greek-style government over-spending. The country's banks particularly its savings banks or \"cajas,\" got caught up in the collapse of a real estate bubble in 2008 that got worse over the past four years. However, as Spain's leaders have struggled for a solution to their banking crisis, the country's borrowing costs have soared close to the level that forced the governments of Greece, Portugal and Ireland to seek rescues.<\/p><p>Some of Spain's banks are struggling with by toxic real estate loans and assets amid fears the problem will get worse as more jobless people can't pay their mortgages. The Bank of Spain says the toxic loans and assets total around \u20ac180 billion. Nationalized lender Bankia SA, which has requested \u20ac19 billion in aid, has \u20ac32 billion in toxic assets. Around four other banks serving the domestic market are considered prime candidates for bailouts.<\/p><p>\"I could never get my mind round the scale of consumption in Spain over the past 20 years, having known it in the 1960s when it was still extremely poor,\" said Paul Preston, a history professor and expert on Spain with the London School of Economics. \"Lots of people enjoyed the consumer boom, but not everybody. Now everybody's having to pay for it.\"<\/p><p>Rajoy blamed Spain's woes on the previous Socialist administration of Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero without mentioning him or his government by name. Zapatero was ousted by Rajoy in a landslide last November by voters outraged over the Socialist handling of the economy.<\/p><p>\"Last year Spain's public administration spent \u20ac90 billion more than it took in, this can't be maintained, we can't live like that,\" Rajoy said.<\/p><p>But Socialist Party leader Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba said Rajoy should acknowledge that Spain is now in bailout territory.<\/p><p>\"The government is trying to make us believe that we've won the lottery, that the Three Kings of Orient have arrived, and that isn't so,\" Rubalcaba said.<\/p><p>After his press conference, Rajoy defended his decision to jet off an hour later to Poland to see Spain's famed national football team take on Italy in the Euro 2012 competition. He said he would be on the ground in Gdansk only for the game before flying back to Madrid Sunday night.<\/p><p>\"I'll be there two and a half hours and then I'll leave,\" Rajoy said. \"I think the national team deserves it.\"","130":"Writer-director Richard Linklater has described his latest film, \"Everybody Wants Some!!,\" as a \"spiritual sequel\" to 1993's \"Dazed and Confused.\" That made my heart fibrillate a little, and maybe yours too. Beginning with its shot of a Pontiac GTO pulling doughnuts in a high school parking lot to Aerosmith's \"Sweet Emotion,\" \"Dazed\" is such a humane approximation of what it was like to come of age in the mid-1970s that one wishes it would never end. On the evidence of \"Boyhood\" and the \"Before Sunrise\" trilogy, though, Linklater doesn't want any of his movies to end. Thus \"Everybody Wants Some!!\"<\/p><p>Which at first is different, sometimes jarringly so, before wading into the open-armed embrace of experience that marks this filmmaker's finest work. The tipoffs are those double exclamation points and an onscreen title font that recalls a Skinemax late-night movie circa 1981. What if you took one of that era's hormone-drenched stu-coms and put real people in it?<\/p><p>The year is 1980, actually, and Jake (Blake Jenner from \"Glee\") is arriving for his freshman year at (the fictional) Southeastern Texas State University. A high school pitching star and rangy college prospect, he's assigned an off-campus baseball dorm with the other players. It's a ready-made animal house, with rules laid down by a briefly seen coach (Jonathan Breck) that are immediately ignored. Occasionally we'll get an onscreen reminder of how many dwindling days and hours remain before classes begin. These, too, are ignored.<\/p><p>Instead, Linklater parks his cameras to observe, with indulgence and much good humor, the bonding rituals of young men who only think they have it figured out. Jake's housemates fall into general categories that re-sort themselves into individual personalities: The motor-mouthed ladies' man Finnegan (Glen Powell), the Zen surfer-stoner Willoughby (Wyatt Russell), uber-competitive McReynolds (Tyler Hoechlin), country rube Billy (Will Brittain), smartass Nesbit (Austin Amelio), na\u00efve Brumley (Tanner Kalina). And so on.<\/p><p>A few stand slightly outside the pack: the over-confident psycho-nerd pitcher Jay Niles (Juston Street, freakily funny) and the laconic second base star Dale Douglas (J. Quinton Johnson), whose blackness is rarely commented on. Where are the women? There to be chased and partied with and seduced. \"This is college, Jake,\" the hero is told early on. \"The girls can be as big sluts as the guys.\"<\/p><p>Oh, dear. Is \"Everybody Wants Some!!\" what happens when you people an entire Richard Linklater movie with Matthew McConaughey's horndog Wooderson from \"Dazed and Confused\"? Yes and no, or, rather, yes, but only at first. As the boys sprawl through the last days of summer, the swagger that borders on smug begins to mellow and melt away. Searching for good times and girls, they hop from a disco one night to a country and western bar the next to a punk mosh pit to an art-student costume party, minds open, adapting, ever-changing. After a while, the hero starts having a smallish identity crisis, confessing that \"it sort of begs the question of who we are.\"<\/p><p>Well, yes. This is college, Jake. Even a high school sports star can be anyone he wants.<\/p><p>The movie eventually spins him off from the crowd into the arms of Beverly (Zoey Deutch), a tartly ardent stage arts freshman with Joni Mitchell posters on her wall. She's unpretentious for a theater brat, he's smart and soulful for a jock, and the two stand dazzled in the Venn diagram overlap of their attraction. These scenes try a little too hard to be charming but they are anyway, and if Deutch has the freckles and immediacy of a classic Brat Pack heroine, it may be because her mother is Lea Thompson of \"Back to the Future\" and \"Some Kind of Wonderful\" and her father is Howard Deutch, who directed the latter.<\/p><p>More second-generation pleasures: Wyatt Russell, who plays the woolly baseball mystic Willoughby, is the son of Kurt Russell and Goldie Hawn, and he has a high old time \u2014 emphasis on high \u2014 explaining to his teammates why \"Fearless,\" from the 1971 album \"Meddle,\" is the best track that Pink Floyd ever recorded. Because he is correct, I am awarding \"Everybody Wants Some!!\" an extra half-star.<\/p><p>Linklater was a high school baseball player who went to Sam Houston State on a scholarship, and the movie is steeped in the lazy, rivalrous minutiae of college ball. Willoughby gets off a moment of bliss when he muses on the pleasures of pitching \u2014 \"It's lovely out there on the bump,\" he says \u2014 and we learn that it's the .230 hitters who are always the most superstitious. Also that it's possible to slice a pitched baseball in half with an ax. At one point, one of the characters gazes with incredulity at a crowd of fellow students and says, \"I know what we're doing here. We're playing baseball. What are they doing here?\"<\/p><p>\"Everybody Wants Some!!\" is a nice long soak in the Proustian detritus of its era. Beverly drives a Gremlin, Jake knows the secret of winning at \"Space Invaders,\" and people can still confidently begin sentences with the words, \"It's like Carl Sagan says. . .\" What \"Sweet Emotion\" was to \"Dazed and Confused,\" so the Knack's \"My Sharona\" is to this movie, and the soundtrack rolls forward from there: glorious junk from the days when Eddie Rabbitt, Eddie Money, Sniff 'n' the Tears, and the BusBoys meant something.<\/p><p>All that's missing is a plot. But Linklater doesn't do plot; he does life. Says Powell's garrulous Finnegan, summing up the art of both this movie and this moviemaker, \"I don't think at all. I just talk a lot. It's jazz improv. You're invited.\" And so are we.<\/p><p>Written and directed by Richard Linklater. Starring Blake Jenner, Zoey Deutch, Glen Powell, Wyatt Russell, Tyler Hoechlin, Juston Street.

When the shoebox-shaped and nearly shoebox-size panini shop opened on Bedford Street 15 years ago, there was nothing quite like it in New York, a restaurant that kept things simple and kept prices low, serving flavorful food in a room that was just adorable enough that you could decide, midmeal, that maybe the two of you squeezed into the counter were there on a date, and not just grabbing a bite.<\/p><p>You have to fire up the Wayback Machine to better understand how 'ino helped change how this city eats. Fifteen years ago, New York was a bistro town. There was the old guard: Blue Ribbon, Le Gamin, Jules, Lucky Strike, Raoul's and a dozen others. Then in 1997, a newcomer opened in SoHo named Balthazar, which raised the stakes with its set direction and unlisted reservation line. Balthazar was white-hot: it had perfectly distressed mirrors, fresh and crusty bread, and although it was impossible to get a table unless you knew somebody who knew somebody, you could always go at midnight and eat at the bar.<\/p><p>Soon, New York was lousy with bistros. It was a good era if you wanted a kir, steak frites, escargot, fris\u00e9e lardon, profiteroles. Authenticity, or some version of it, was the point. Everybody was pressing butter into little ramekins to be served at room temperature, changing the paper covering the tablecloths before serving dessert.<\/p><p>Honestly, it was really fun. The restaurants were lively, intimate, sexy. So what if you could recite the menu before you set foot in the door? But if you were a young chef with a measure of vision and creativity, you were stuck either making onion soup and beet salad with goat cheese. Or you worked on the line executing the vision and creativity of an older chef in Midtown or TriBeCa. Prune hadn't yet opened. Neither had Diner. Brooklyn didn't have much of a food scene outside the restaurant row on Smith Street, which was anchored by Patois, a bistro. If you went to Williamsburg, it was to go to a party or to go dancing, not to eat. This was the landscape when Jason and Jennifer Denton opened 'ino on a quiet street in the West Village. The kitchen in the back was the size of a D.J. booth and used the technology of induction burners, which was novel at the time: it was a paninoteca that looked as if it belonged in New York rather than being shipped, tile by mirrored tile, from Milan.<\/p><p>The culinary vocabulary was Italian, but it wasn't sepia-toned and sentimental. Instead, there was a focus on ingredients at a time when, in New York at least, few people cared. It had simple food done well, and sometimes you encountered flavors that weren't lifted out of the songbook. I still have a 13-year-old memory of sharing a shredded duck sandwich with sweet relish, a combination that is about as authentically Italian as a functioning parliament. You could go to 'ino to get something familiar (prosciutto and cheese will never get old), but you could also try something new.<\/p><p>'Ino was a casual joint with integrity, an easygoing place where you could eat well as long as you didn't mind the wait. Today, we take this combination for granted, and expect all kitchens to put some effort into sourcing and display a little creativity no matter how limited the resources. That we do owes a little bit to 'ino.","134":"Disunion follows the Civil War as it unfolded.<\/p><p>The Lincoln administration may not have gone to war in 1861 to end slavery, but no one bothered to tell that to the slaves. Within six weeks of the firing on Fort Sumter, Gen. Benjamin Butler was forced to decide what to do with three slaves who escaped to Fortress Monroe on the north shore of Virginia's James River. Butler, certainly no abolitionist, nonetheless refused to return the three to their owner, labeling them \"contrabands of war.\"<\/p><p>The term, suitably ambiguous for an administration that as yet had no policy on how to handle the fugitives, found immediate acceptance. As one Union officer wrote, \"Never was a word so speedily adopted by so many people in so short a time.\" Within weeks hundreds of \"contrabands\" \u2014 men, women and children \u2014 flocked to Fortress Monroe and other Union Army positions. Unsure what might greet them, the escaped slaves were yet confident that life under federal control must surely represent an improvement.<\/p><p>It took the federal government more than a year to devise a policy in answer to this thirst for freedom. In August 1861, the First Confiscation Act stripped slaveholders of their claim of ownership, but it failed to clarify whether the slaves were themselves free. The following March Congress prohibited the military from sending escaped slaves back into slavery, and in July the Second Confiscation Act decreed that all slaves that took refuge in Union areas were \"captives of war\" and would be set free.<\/p><p>These legislative actions took on ever greater significance as Union forces moved deeper and deeper into Confederate territory. The growing number of contrabands reaching federal lines necessitated the establishment of dozens of impromptu contraband camps. A draft map compiled by the National Park Service illustrates how the network of these generally transitory camps mirrored the advance of the Union Army along the Mississippi, Tennessee and Cumberland River systems. Grant's Army of the Tennessee spent the summer of 1862 protecting supply lines in western Tennessee and northern Mississippi. Victories at the Battle of Iuka in September and the Battle of Corinth in early October solidified Union control of the area.<\/p><p>Lincoln's announcement of the preliminary Emancipation Proclamation on Sept. 22, 1862, produced an even greater flood of refugees. How best to use and care for these contrabands proved particularly vexing for military leaders under Grant's command. \"You have no idea of the consternation Old Abe's Proclamation is making,\" wrote Gen. Grenville Dodge to his brother in September. The contrabands \"will not even wait until 1st January. I do not know what we shall do with them.\"<\/p><p>Many of these fugitives arrived in an appalling condition. \"There were men, women, and children in every stage of disease or decrepitude often nearly naked, with flesh torn by the terrible experiences of their escape,\" wrote one observer. \"Often the slaves met prejudices against their color more bitter than any they had left behind.\"<\/p><p>On Nov. 11, 1862, Grant took the first step toward addressing the crisis: he named John Eaton, a former high school principal and chaplain of the 27th Ohio Infantry, as superintendent of contrabands and set him at work \"organizing them into suitable companies for working.\" A month later he went further. \"The negroes will be clothed, and in every way provided for, out of their earnings\" \u2014 about 12.5 cents for each pound of cotton picked \u2014 \"so far as practicable,\" he ordered. \"In no case will negroes be forced into the service of the Government, or be enticed away from their homes except when it becomes a military necessity.\"<\/p><p>Grant's policies lent the contraband camps an official status and began to define what a freedman could and could not do once within the Union lines. Personally, Grant appears to have had no particular sympathy for the refugees. He seems to have recognized that, in the words of one observer, \"The soldiers of our army were a good deal opposed to serving the Negro in any manner.\" Nevertheless, the Union commander unreservedly supported Eaton's work and in the process enabled the creation of one of the war's most successful contraband camps, located at Corinth, Miss.<\/p><p>Although formally organized under the direction of General Dodge in early December 1862 and placed under the command of James M. Alexander, chaplain of the 66th Illinois, the Corinth camp likely came into existence as early as September. Initially housed in army tents no longer considered serviceable for Union troops, the freedmen were soon set to work downing trees and clearing land on which to build cabins and lay out streets, which were named for Union generals. Eventually the freedmen also built a four-room school, a commissary, a hospital, a church and an office. The entire camp was divided into wards, complete with ward masters and a police force.<\/p><p>In late 1862 the American Missionary Association sent its first volunteers to Corinth to help care for, educate and minister to the freedmen. In a memoir written years after the war, one such missionary recalled her experience. \"When brought face to face with the slaves,\" she wrote, \"it was like the discovery of a new race.\" The men and women who came to Corinth generally shared a paternalistic optimism and viewed the freedmen as childlike in their enthusiasm for both education and salvation.<\/p><p>The freedmen's thirst for knowledge was undeniable. \"You will find them every hour of daylight, at their books,\" observed the Rev. Edward Pierce in March of 1863. \"We cannot enter a cabin, or tent, but that we see from one to three with books.\" Within no time Pierce and his wife had more than 150 students, and by the end of the summer, the addition of more missionaries enabled the school to accommodate between 300 and 400 children as well as 60 adults at a night school. In August, one of the teachers estimated that as many as 1,000 freedmen had learned to read in the Corinth camp.<\/p><p>Organized religion followed closely on the heels of formal education. Reverend Olds \"saw an earnestness in reference to the Christian life that I have seldom seen. And as I saw their deep earnestness & heard their hearty responses,\" he said, \"I was led to ask where can we find a more impressible people than these?\"<\/p><p>The population of the camp fluctuated between 1,500 and 6,000, as large groups undertook assignments for the Union Army or contracted to work on local plantations. In March 1863, for example, the camp was home to 658 men, 1,440 women and 1,559 children. Among the men were 36 blacksmiths, 48 carpenters, 180 teamsters and 200 cooks. The female ranks included 80 seamstresses, 150 laundresses and 600 cooks. Two-thirds of the men and three-quarters of the women were married, and seven in eight women had children. According to John Eaton's records, the camp had experienced 900 cases of illness, 189 deaths and 45 births.<\/p><p>Life at Corinth changed dramatically after a May 1863 visit by Adj. Gen. Lorenzo Thomas, who was intent on recruiting thousands of contrabands for his newly formed black regiments. With the organization of the 1st Alabama Infantry of African Descent, later renamed the 55th United States Colored Troops, the camp lost most of its able-bodied men.<\/p><p>Their departure to fight left only the women, the young, the old and the infirm to carry on Eaton's ambitious agricultural program, which rested on the cooperative farming of large tracts of abandoned and confiscated land. The program put 400 acres under cultivation, 300 for cotton and 100 for vegetables. Each cabin also had its own subsistence garden. By May 1863, the success of the agricultural program and the presence of a multitude of skilled artisans produced a clear monthly profit of $4,000 to $5,000 for the government, as well as an admirably independent community that Eaton hoped might serve as a model for other camps.<\/p><p>Unfortunately, the success of the Corinth camp proved short-lived. Plans for a winter campaign by Union forces in January 1864 provided a grim reminder that the fate of the freedmen was always secondary to the triumph of the Union cause. The order to relocate the camp's inhabitants 93 miles westward, to Memphis, \"fell like a bomb-shell among our contented people,\" lamented one missionary, \"but military orders are preemptory,\" and they \"must be obeyed.\" The freedmen left their \"well-organized village,\" gardens and farms to tdiv><\/p><p>The move from Corinth destroyed the spirit that had animated the freedmen's success. Some of the new refugees found work on confiscated plantations or in Memphis, but most lived in one of several camps surrounding the city.<\/p><p>\"The destruction of the Corinth camp,\" noted one historian, \"was one of the tragedies of the Civil War.\" Eaton's plan for large-scale cooperative farming fell victim to a bitter struggle between the War and Treasury departments over the leasing of plantations and was never implemented elsewhere. And no more than one or two other camps were able to replicate the strong civilian leadership, well-planned and policed living environment, and emphasis on education that made Corinth a success.<\/p><p>Had the government learned from the model fashioned in northern Mississippi between the fall of 1862 and early 1864, the newly freed slaves might well have enjoyed a far easier transition to life in postwar America.<\/p><p>Sources: Joseph E.

It's a sci-fi showpiece. It's an ultralight carbon-fiber production car. It's a triumph of parts-bin engineering. It's a take-no-prisoners canyon racer. It's a winged chariot of the Malibu \u00fcber-chic. It's a $136,625 (destination included!) commuter car for Silicon Valley moguls.<\/p><p>The hardware, at least, is straightforward. The central passenger shell is a stiff, lightweight carbon-fiber structure. It is bolted to an aluminum skeleton that holds the 7.1-kilowatt-hour lithium-ion battery pack in its spine.<\/p><p>An electric drive section similar to the one in the BMW i3 people pod is bolted to the front, its 131 horsepower electric motor and 2-speed automatic transmission driving the front wheels. The rear power package is sourced from the new Mini; its 3-cylinder, twin-turbocharged 231-horsepower engine drives the rear wheels through a 6-speed automatic transmission.<\/p><p>The multilayered skin is molded thermoplastic that weighs half as much as steel. Other extreme weight-saving measures, including aluminum wiring and chemically hardened ultrathin glass, keep the weight to 3,267 pounds. The long, light doors swing up and forward. From the front, with doors open, the i8 looks as if it's signaling a touchdown.<\/p><p>The interior is compact yet comfortable, though those over 6-foot-2 may need more legroom, and the rear seats are designed for tiny, limber people.<\/p><p>Getting in is a challenge.

Imagine climbing from a bathtub without using your hands.<\/p><p>Pick a personality with the driving-mode buttons. \"Comfort\" keeps the car in electric mode to 37 m.p.h., or until you mash the right-side pedal. The eDrive button keeps things electric to 75 m.p.h. or until the battery fades.<\/p><p>Travel range is about 20 miles in E.V. mode, and recharging takes 1.5 hours at 240 volts or four hours at 120.

Even with the variable dampers at full soft, the i8 bobs its nose like Muhammad Ali in the first rounds. High-performance tires come standard in the United States; European versions get narrower wheels and taller tires for lower drag and a smoother ride.<\/p><p>In Sport mode, the suspension and steering stiffen and the gas engine roars, pops on upshifts and matches revs downshifting into corners. It sounds great, and it should: much of what you hear is a prerecorded soundtrack piped through the sound system.<\/p><p>The i8 feels strong at full power, but the head-snapping response expected from a partly electric powertrain is absent. The i8 takes time to gather itself, with an atavistic vestige of turbo lag.<\/p><p>On the intestinal twists of Mulholland Highway the i8 can be driven with brutal abandon. The brakes are strong, the chassis is as stiff as a bank vault, and there's enough power to reach the next corner presently.

A car that will be used for emissions-free commuting should allow people to get in and get out. It rides harshly.

Boy, the evidence sure is there.\"<\/p><p>With at least 10 catches and 132 yards over the final two regular-season games, Crabtree (73 catches, 868 yards) would become the 49ers' first 1,000-yard receiver since Terrell Owens in 2003 and will have the most receptions since Owens hauled in 100 in 2002.<\/p><p>Davis, who had team-highs in targets (eight), receptions (six) and yards (83) in Kaepernick's first start against Chicago last month, has since become an afterthought. He had one catch for 10 yards against the Patriots, and four catches, 29 yards and nine targets over the last four games.<\/p><p>Davis said he's yet to establish a chemistry with Kaepernick that matches the connection he had with former starter Alex Smith.<\/p><p>\"You have to develop that chemistry, that bond so you can be on the same page,\" Davis said. \"That's something me and Kaep don't have right now. We don't have it. You have to expect it because he just stepped in. Me and Alex, we've been here.\"<\/p><p>Asked why Crabtree has been quick to get on the same page, Davis said the red-hot wide receiver has been running shorter routes. However, he also noted, as Kaepernick did Sunday night, that Crabtree has earned his targets by breaking free from coverage.<\/p><p>\"Crab is a pretty good route runner,\" Davis said. \"He's getting open and Kaep is finding him.\"<\/p><p>Eric Branch is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.

He said that the defendant feared for his life in an unrelated dispute and accidentally shot Kelly as the football player was waiting in a car to give his stepbrother, Brandon Young, a ride home from his girlfriend's house in Richmond's Iron Triangle District.<\/p><p>Laba argued that Pratcher should be convicted of manslaughter because the death was \"a tragic mistake.\"<\/p><p>But prosecutor David Brown told jurors Kelly's death amounted to \"cold-blooded murder,\" because Pratcher was determined to kill someone that night. Brown argued that Pratcher had the opportunity to notice that Kelly was in the car before grabbing the rifle, advancing on the Oldsmobile and opening fire.<\/p><p>\"It's totally unfair for them to say it was premeditated,\" said Pratcher's father, Larry Sr. \"Terrance just came right up; it's impossible for it to be premeditated. It's totally unfair -- my son is not guilty of first degree murder.\"<\/p><p>Pratcher was 15 years old when Kelly was killed and was tried as an adult in Contra Costa County Superior Court. He faces and faces a maximum sentence of 25 years to life.<\/p><p>Kelly died two days before he was to leave for the University of Oregon, where he had a football scholarship and was expected top play safety.

Fewer voters than expected turned out.<\/p><p>Editor's note: John Avlon is a CNN contributor and senior political columnist for Newsweek and The Daily Beast. He is co-editor of the book \"Deadline Artists: America's Greatest Newspaper Columns.\"<\/p><p>(CNN) -- Beneath Rick Santorum's stunning three-state sweep on Tuesday stands another stubborn sign of dissatisfaction with the status quo: Republican turnout is down.<\/p><p>I'm talking embarrassingly, disturbingly, hey-don't-you-know-it's-an-election-year bad. It is a sign of a serious enthusiasm gap among the rank and file, and a particularly bad omen for Mitt Romney and the GOP in the general election.<\/p><p>Here's the tale of the tape, state by state, beginning with Tuesday night: Minnesota had just more than 47,000 people turn out for its caucuses this year -- four years ago it was nearly 63,000 -- and Romney came in first, not a distant third as he did Tuesday night. In Colorado, more than 70,000 people turned out for its caucus in 2008 -- but in 2012 it was 65,000. And Missouri -- even making a generous discount for the fact that this was an entirely symbolic contest -- had 232,000 people turn out, less than half the number who did four years ago.<\/p><p>Even with months of pre-primary hype and attention solely devoted to the Republican field, turnout in this election cycle essentially flat-lined. In Iowa, a little more than 121,000 people voted, compared with nearly 119,000 four years before, when action in the Democratic caucuses absorbed most of the attention.<\/p><p>In New Hampshire, the same dynamic applied -- 245,000 voters turned out in 2012, compared with 241,000 four years before, despite Republicans being the only game in town and independents making up 47% of the total turnout in 2012, according to CNN exit polls. Take out the independent voters and you've got a deep net decline.<\/p><p>Always proudly rebellious, South Carolina has been the great outlier in this election cycle. With Newt Gingrich making an all-out push for conservatives in a conservative state, turnout was up almost 150,000 over four years before.<\/p><p>But in Florida, the decline became unmistakable. Maybe it decreased because the Romney and Gingrich campaigns, plus super PACS, spent more than $18 million in the Sunshine State on TV ads, of which 93% were negative in the last week alone, according to the Campaign Media Analysis Group. After all, negative ads depress turnout. But after all the mud was thrown, 1.6 million people turned out in the nation's fourth largest state, which might sound impressive until you compare it with the nearly 2 million who turned out in 2008.<\/p><p>Nevada was even worse, with 32,894 people turning out to vote in a state with more than 465,000 registered Republicans. Four years before, more than 44,300 participated in the caucus. Turnout was down more than 25% despite the GOP caucuses being the only game in town. Party officials were expecting a turnout of more than 70,000.<\/p><p>All this should be a wake-up call for the GOP. Despite an enormous amount of national media attention devoted to each of the states to date, the response has been a notable yawn among the Republican rank and file.<\/p><p>The turnout numbers are even worse when you compare them with the number of registered Republicans in each state that has voted to date.<\/p><p>The caucuses in particular bring out an unrepresentative sample of a state's Republican Party. For all the grass-roots romanticism, there has got to be a better way to pick a presidential nominee.<\/p><p>But the news is worst for Romney, long the presumptive front-runner in a party that tends to reward the man next in line.<\/p><p>\"Reluctantly Romney\" could be a bumper sticker, even for his supporters. The former Massachusetts governor has found it difficult to climb above 35% in national polls, meaning that a majority of Republicans still support someone else in a notably weak field. His vote margins and totals lag behind those of four years before, when he lost the nomination to John McCain in a crowded and comparatively competent field, although Minnesota is the first state he won in '08 and lost in 2012.<\/p><p>You reap what you sow, and part of the reason turnout is down is directly related to the problem of polarization. The Republican Party is more ideologically polarized than at any time in recent history. Therefore, it put up more purely right-wing candidates than it did four years before, when center-right leaders such as McCain and Rudy Giuliani were also in the race. A bigger tent inspired bigger turnout.<\/p><p>But the other reason is simple dissatisfaction with the candidates.<\/p><p>Republicans seem united in their anger against the president -- like the Democrats in 2004 -- but they are uninspired by their options. Draft movements for fantasy candidates ranging from Chris Christie to Mitch Daniels to Paul Ryan and even Jeb Bush have started and failed. Some party leaders show more enthusiasm for a hypothetical 2016 crop of candidates, including Marco Rubio and Bobby Jindal, than they do for the flawed choices before them in this election. Divided and dispirited is an odd place for the Republican Party to be so soon after the enthusiasms of the 2010 tea party-driven election.<\/p><p>The bottom line is that voter turnout matters. And what should be most troubling for Republicans is that this enthusiasm gap among the conservative base is accompanied by a lack of candidates who might appeal to independents and centrist swing voters in the general election. It is a double barrel of bad news for the Republican Party. The numbers can be spun and rationalized by professional partisan operatives all day long, but the fact remains -- voters just aren't turning out to cast their votes for this crop of conservative candidates in 2012.<\/p><p>Follow CNN Opinion on Twitter.<\/p><p>Join the conversation on Facebook.<\/p><p>The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John Avlon.","143":"The Coworking Resources Series is supported by join.me.

Just gather at join.me.<\/p><p>If you've decided that it's time to leave your bathrobe at home, let your favorite coffee shop have its corner table back, and join a coworking space, you're only halfway there. Though coworking can have a lot of perks, how you take advantage of them and shape your experience is up to you.<\/p><p>\"We've had people who within the first week they've kind of immersed themselves [in]to events and socializing with other people here, or they're just here, they do their work, and then they take off,\" says Jeff Park, who manages the Ravenswood Coworking Group in Chicago. \"We know that they come in, but I think for them that's enough for them. They just want to be around other people in a productive environment.\"<\/p><p>Whether you're aiming to be as productive as possible without a lot of socializing or trying to build a strong professional community that you can turn to for resources and support, these five tips can help you get the most out of your coworking experience.<\/p><p>Green Spaces, a coworking space in Tribeca, specializes in environmentally focused businesses. Mountain View-based Cubes & Crayons combines childcare and coworking. WorkBar in Boston is hosted in a 2,500-square-foot space and has separate areas for cafe-like and quieter working styles. Coworking Brooklyn uses a small room that functions as an art gallery by night.<\/p><p>The coworking experience varies drastically depending on which space you're using. Different spaces have different levels of interaction with other workers, formality and general vibe. While some spaces, like Green Spaces and Cubes & Crayons, state their niche upfront, you'll only be able to gauge what the environment is like by dropping in. Most spaces have daily drop-in rates. Try a couple of different spaces to see what works best for you before you commit. You can find a list of space around the world on the Coworking Wiki.<\/p><p>\"See if the people in the space are people who you could go and see every day\u2026if it's not, then go to the next space,\" says Jay Catalan, the co-founder of a coworking space in Vancouver called The Network Hub.<\/p><p>It's less awkward to introduce yourself on the first day than to work alongside someone for months before asking their name. Even if you're not usually outgoing, try to make a special effort for the first week or two when you start in a new coworking space.<\/p><p>\"Just make introductions and it goes a long way\u2026We've had some people they wish they had met sooner because it turns out they did similar lines of work and just talking about it or actually sharing work, it's not something you want to find out when you only have a couple more months left on your project or something,\" Park says.<\/p><p>If you're shy about meeting people, try getting creative (like, for instance, bringing food). Bill Jacobson and Dave Ulrich, who co-founded WorkBar, said that one new coworker at WorkBar Boston showed up with a big box of doughnuts. \"He got to know everybody pretty quick,\" Jacobson says.<\/p><p>Don't stop interacting with your coworkers after you introduce yourself. One of the biggest benefits of coworking is the built-in community of professionals working across different industries.<\/p><p>\"It may not seem directly 'productive' to chat with your coworker for 10 minutes mid-day, but indirectly, it yields greater results than almost anything else you could spend time on,\" says Parker Whitney, office manager for Philadelphia coworking space Independents Hall, though he says, \"Invest in your community by taking (not faking) interest in what its members do, and it will take you with it\u2026The people you've always wanted to know are sitting all around you. Ask questions. Learn. Most importantly, help them when you can.\"<\/p><p>If you are too busy during the workday for water cooler conversation, most coworking spaces host happy hours, seminars or other events that are prime opportunities for learning more about your coworkers.<\/p><p>\"Even when you work for yourself, it's important to realize your limitations,\" says Dave Martorana, a freelance Python & iPhone developer who works at Independents Hall. \"If you're a software developer, you're not necessarily a designer, product manager, or marketer as well. When you work at a coworking space, people with those skills probably work right next to you and are just as interested in building something awesome as you are.\"<\/p><p>While coworking one day, I ended up testing someone's website, getting caught in the crossfire of a music choice showdown, and participating in a raised-hand vote about which suit jacket a fellow coworker should wear to a meeting.

Fuel Tech also sells chemicals that are tossed into a coal burner to fight slag and thereby boost power plant efficiency. The company generates most of its revenue in the U.S., but management is looking to expand in emerging markets like China and eastern Europe, where pollution-control technology is still quite new.<\/p><p>Fuel Tech shares look expensive at 78 times my earnings projection of 15 cents a share for the 12 months beginning in July, but I expect rapid growth.

He's solid, beefy, rough-hewn, creaking along in his heavy leather costume, with a look on his puss of weary disdain.<\/p><p>What makes him sexy is his sense of honor and loyalty: \"What we do in life echoes in eternity!\" Anyway, it can't be his hygiene, although he is frequently bathed in a sanctifying golden glow.<\/p><p>After a coup by the emperor's weak-kneed son, Commodus (a whiny, surprisingly fleshy Joaquin Phoenix), Maximus' fortunes change. He winds up being thrown to the tigers, two shows daily, in Rome's Colosseum, the entertainment complex of its day.<\/p><p>Crowe, like his character, must grimly come to terms with the fact that, actor or gladiator, it's all about showmanship. Give the crowd what it wants, either at the multiplex or in the arena, and you can write your own ticket.<\/p><p>\"I have power only to amuse the mob,\" he spits contemptuously like a Shakespearean actor reduced to dinner theater.<\/p><p>The plot, about avenging honor, provides brief respite between an array of hand-to-hand battles that are pitched so furiously that individual components barely register; they're subliminal suggestions of computer-assisted carnage, with Jackson Pollock sprays of blood. For fans of the genre, yes, this is a good thing.<\/p><p>Connie Nielsen plays Commodus' sister and possible love interest for Maximus once his family is dispatched (politics, you know). Nielsen's costumes are laced up like bondage gear, and there is a tantalizing hint of romance past.<\/p><p>But the camera only has eyes for Crowe. The glowering! The seething! The hooded gaze! The quiet suffering! (Watch him carve away a tattoo he no longer has use for. No anesthetic! No disinfectant!)<\/p><p>The supporting cast makes for a gauntlet of worthy friends and adversaries, all of them thinkers, including Derek Jacobi (\"I, Claudius\") as a senator, Djimon Hounsou (\"Amistad\") as a fellow gladiator and Oliver Reed, who died with two days to go on the shoot, looking a little woozy as a gladiator entrepreneur.<\/p><p>Reed's character is the one most in touch with the movie's premise - that entertainment is the goal, and a worthy one at that.","147":"Despite the firestorm over his comments about rape and pregnancy, Representative Todd Akin says he has no plans to drop out as the Republican Senate nominee in Missouri.<\/p><p>But what if he did?<\/p><p>The procedures in Missouri to change nominees midstream are complicated and intended to discourage just the sort of change that many in the Republican Party say they are eager to see happen.<\/p><p>\"As more time passes, you're starting to go up against deadlines,\" said Stacie Temple, a spokeswoman for Missouri's secretary of state, Robin Carnahan, a Democrat. Ms. Temple said the longer Mr. Akin waited, the more difficult it would get.<\/p><p>The first deadline for Mr. Akin to have easily withdrawn from the race was Tuesday evening. His decision to stay in the race means that he now has only a few weeks to reconsider before things get even harder.<\/p><p>Certification of the presidential ballots in Missouri will be no later than Sept. 17, and could be shortly after President Obama officially accepts the Democratic nomination on Sept. 5.<\/p><p>Once the ballots are printed, any candidate who seeks to withdraw must pay for the reprinting of new ballots. That could be prohibitively expensive for Mr. Akin, but presumably the Republican Party \u2014 which badly wants him to withdraw \u2014 would cover the cost.<\/p><p>Military overseas ballots begin shipping out Sept. 22. That might be the first firm deadline. But the drop-dead deadline is Sept. 25, when general absentee ballots are sent out.<\/p><p>Mel Carnahan, the former Missouri governor and Ms. Carnahan's father, died on Oct. 16, 2000, during his campaign for the Senate against the Republican incumbent, John Ashcroft. Mr. Carnahan's name nonetheless appeared on the ballot in November \u2014 and he won. (His widow, Jean, was appointed to the seat, and lost it in special election in 2002.)<\/p><p>Assuming that Mr. Akin bows to pressure from Republican leaders (or simply concludes that he isn't able to raise enough money to mount a credible campaign), Missouri law requires that he seek a court order allowing him to drop out of the race.<\/p><p>State officials say that issuing such court orders is routine. Mr. Akin would merely have to file the necessary papers with the court and his name would no longer be printed on the November ballot. Republicans could then quickly nominate someone else to run against Senator Claire McCaskill, the Democratic incumbent.<\/p><p>Democrats would no doubt like to see Mr. Akin \u2014 now politically weakened by his comments on rape and pregnancy \u2014 stay in the race. In theory, the Democratic officials who run the state's election offices could object to Mr. Akin's request for a court order, a move that would force a hearing before a judge.<\/p><p>The relevant statute says someone like Mr. Akin can withdraw \"pursuant to a court order, which, except for good cause shown by the election authority in opposition thereto, shall be freely given upon application by the candidate to the circuit court in the county of such candidate's residence.\"<\/p><p>Election officials say they can find no precedent at all for such an objection in the state's history. But Ms. Carnahan is herself a factor in Republican minds. As the Democratic Senate nominee in 2010, she lost to Representative Roy Blunt, and Republicans imagine she could put up a fight.<\/p><p>\"The secretary's job is to protect the rights of Missouri voters,\" Ms. Temple said when asked whether Ms. Carnahan would fight a court order to remove Mr. Akin's name from the ballot.<\/p><p>A further complication: Under state law, any election authority in Missouri can oppose a withdrawal order, down to the county and city level, and there are Democrats aplenty in Missouri. But Ms. Temple added that right now, it would be up to a Missouri court to determine whether Mr. Akin could withdraw, not the secretary of state.<\/p><p>\"It's completely in the hands of the court to decide the facts,\" she said.<\/p><p>Assuming Mr. Akin does manage to drop out, the state central committee of the Republican Party in Missouri would have to pick a new candidate within 28 days, or by Oct. 12, whichever comes first.","148":"Jim Herron Zamora, Chronicle Staff Writer<\/p><p>Larry and Muriel fight back tears as they leave the courthouse after hearing that their son Darren Ray was found the guilty of killing Terrance Kelly, Wednesday Oct. 11, 2006, in Martinez, Ca.

He said that the defendant feared for his life in an unrelated dispute and accidentally shot Kelly as the football player was waiting in a car to give his stepbrother, Brandon Young, a ride home from his girlfriend's house in Richmond's Iron Triangle District.<\/p><p>Laba argued that Pratcher should be convicted of manslaughter because the death was \"a tragic mistake.\"<\/p><p>But prosecutor David Brown told jurors Kelly's death amounted to \"cold-blooded murder,\" because Pratcher was determined to kill someone that night. Brown argued that Pratcher had the opportunity to notice that Kelly was in the car before grabbing the rifle, advancing on the Oldsmobile and opening fire.<\/p><p>\"It's totally unfair for them to say it was premeditated,\" said Pratcher's father, Larry Sr. \"Terrance just came right up; it's impossible for it to be premeditated. It's totally unfair -- my son is not guilty of first degree murder.\"<\/p><p>Pratcher was 15 years old when Kelly was killed and was tried as an adult in Contra Costa County Superior Court.

Monsanto mon says it is not considering physical barriers like fences or guards.<\/p><p>The FBI and the U.S. Justice Department say cases of espionage in the agriculture sector have been growing since Mo was first discovered digging in an Iowan field in May 2011. Over the past two years, U.S. companies, government research facilities and universities have all been targeted, according to the FBI.<\/p><p>Although prosecutors were unable to establish a Chinese government link to Mo's group, the case adds to U.S.-China frictions over what Washington says is increasing economic espionage and trade secret theft by Beijing and its proxies.<\/p><p>A U.S. law enforcement official told Reuters the agency looked for a connection between the Chinese government and the conspiracy carried out by Mo.<\/p><p>\"In cases like this, we can see connections, but proving to the threshold needed in court requires that we have documents that the government has directed this,\" the official said. \"It's almost impossible to get.\"<\/p><p>A Chinese embassy spokesman in Washington, Zhu Haiquan, said he did not have detailed information on the Mo case but that China \"stands firm\" on the protection of intellectual property and maintains \"constant communication and cooperation\" with the U.S. government on the issue.<\/p><p>On his visit to Washington last September, President Xi Jinping reiterated China's denial of any government role in the hacking of U.S. corporate secrets.<\/p><p>Mo, an employee of Chinese firm Kings Nower Seed, pleaded guilty to stealing seed grown by U.S. firms Monsanto, Dupont Pioneer dd and LG Seeds.<\/p><p>Prosecutors say he specifically targeted fields that grow the parent seeds needed to replicate GMO corn. The FBI says it suspects he was given the location by workers for the seed companies, but did not charge any employees.<\/p><p>DuPont Pioneer and LG Seeds declined to comment for this story.<\/p><p>Mo, whose case was prosecuted by the Justice Department as a national security matter rather than a simple criminal case, now faces a sentence of up to five years in prison. Five others charged in the case are still wanted by the FBI and are believed to have fled to China or Argentina. Charges were dropped against a sixth Chinese suspect.<\/p><p>The number of international economic espionage cases referred to the FBI is rising, up 15% each year between 2009 and 2014 and up 53% in 2015.

Still, President Xi called in 2014 for China to innovate and dominate the technique, which promises high yields through resistance to drought, pests and disease.<\/p><p>In January, a Greenpeace report found some Chinese farmers are illegally growing GMO corn whose strains belong to companies including Monsanto, Syngenta syt and DuPont Pioneer.<\/p><p>Monsanto, which supplies Burrack's seed, said it can block foreign groups who request to tour their lab and learning center in Huxley, Iowa. For the past few years, Monsanto says it has run its own background checks on Chinese delegations that ask for a tour, and, if they are approved, boosts security to be sure they do not steal anything or take pictures.<\/p><p>In Washington, U.S. senators have called for a review of the $43 billion deal by state-owned ChemChina to buy Swiss seed group Syngenta, which generates nearly a quarter of its revenue from North America.<\/p><p>Acquiring GMO seed and successfully recreating a corn plant would allow Chinese companies to skip over roughly eight years of research and $1.5 billion spent annually by Monsanto to develop the corn, the company says.<\/p><p>Burrack's farm itself was not targeted by Mo, though he grows the Monsanto parent seed that the Chinese national was digging for. Burrack grows the corn in two fields in front of and behind his house where he can watch them, a small part of his 2,800-acre farm.<\/p><p>He said he is told by Monsanto where and when to plant the parent seed, but has never been told to keep what he is planting a secret.<\/p><p>\"What no one seems to understand is that they're stealing from people like me,\" Burrack said. \"They're stealing the research that farmers pay for when they buy Monsanto seed.\"","151":"While living in an apartment in Pentagon City, Stephanie Gimenez Stahlberg and her husband, Patrick Stahlberg, a software engineer, began searching for a house where they could raise their family.<\/p><p>With two children \u2014 now 31\/2 and 1 1\/2 \u2014 the Stahlbergs needed more space, including a study area for Stephanie, who is enrolled in a PhD program at the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies.<\/p><p>The house they found in Cherrydale, a neighborhood in North Arlington, met their expectations.

While many neighbors have lived in the area for as long as 60 years, newcomers move in and out these days, said Kathryn Holt Springston, who worked for the Smithsonian American History Tours Office as an educational specialist and historian for 28 years. She also served as curator and director of the Arlington Historical Museum and editor of the Cherrydale Citizens' Association newsletter.<\/p><p>Single-family homes, the Arlington public schools, access to bike trails and proximity to the District draw people to the neighborhood. Sometimes, though, they move in but stay only a few years. Finding a house in Cherrydale can involve the competitive process the Stahlbergs experienced.<\/p><p>About half a mile north of the Virginia Square and Ballston Metro stations on the Orange and Silver lines, Cherrydale has a variety of residences ranging from farmhouses to bungalows to Sears and Montgomery Ward kit homes with two to five or bedrooms or sometimes more. Many date from 1900 to 1930, though some of the older houses were purchased to be torn down and replaced with larger homes, including some built as recently as this year.<\/p><p>Living there: Cherrydale lies north of Interstate 66 and south of Lorcom Lane, stretching roughly from Utah Street on the west to the northward-curving interstate on the east. The Maywood neighborhood claims the eastern half of those boundaries north of Lee Highway, lending something of an arrowhead shape to Cherrydale. Since 1908, the Cherrydale Citizens' Association has planned activities and resolved neighborhood concerns. In the 1970s and 1980s, people often referred to the neighborhood as Mayberry, according to Springston, 63. In 1948, her parents bought the house where she lives with her husband and son. It dates to 1890, Springston said.<\/p><p>In the neighborhood, 49 properties sold in the past year, according to Billy Buck, an associate broker at Buck & Associates. The lowest priced was a one-bedroom, one-bath condominium for $200,000; the highest priced was a five-bedroom, five-bath farmhouse at $1.63 million. Twelve properties are on the market now, ranging from a one-bedroom, two-bath condo for $274,900 to a new five-bedroom, five-bath Craftsman house at $1.799 million.<\/p><p>Welcome wagon: The five-points intersection \u2014 Lee Highway, Old Dominion Drive, Quincy Street, Military Road and Quebec Street \u2014 is dotted with at least two car dealerships and other commercial establishments while nearby is a Safeway and the Cherrydale Hardware, which opened in 1938.<\/p><p>The Cherrydale Volunteer Fire House, built in 1919, is home to such events as the annual spaghetti dinner, concerts and for 90 years each December there is a visit from Santa Claus for children under 12.

It's been nearly two decades since pictures of this sort were produced with any regularity by the studio system, and a lot longer since they were stateside successes. Many of the attempts in recent years have been, at best, mid-budget passion projects with circumscribed audiences (Stallone's own<\/p><p>which topped out at $42 million domestically) or post-modern winks (the French-language \"JCVD\" from 2008, a hostage movie in which Jean-Claude Van Damme plays a version of himself). The few large-scale attempts, like \"The A-Team,\" underperformed. (The biceps-and-bullets remake grossed $77 million domestically, a number that will likely be easily surpassed by \"The Expendables.\")<\/p><p>But the Stallone picture -- with its hard-charging, take-no-prisoners patriotism unbothered by the vagaries of the real world (it takes place in a fictional country, for starters) and its caricature of freedom-hating enemies (\"We will kill this American disease,\" as the TV spot enticed us) -- planted itself squarely in the old-school genre. And this weekend, the movie showed that there's life in that category yet. That \"Scott Pilgrim vs. the World,\" the tongue-in-cheek, pop-culture-referential, decidedly 2010 creation -- the one for, of and by arch fanboys -- trailed well behind \"The Expendables\" only drove home the point more loudly.<\/p><p>On one hand, it's understandable that a movie of easy American heroism (OK, first-world Western heroism) would catch on. In fact, it's surprising it didn't happen sooner. Apple-pie-patriotism already is behind the success of a cable news network and supports large sections of the contemporary country music industry. Why not a film hit too?<\/p><p>But among all the factors to which one might point in explaining the success of \"The Expendables\" -- a cast harvested from so many demographics and eras; a moviegoer backlash to 3-D and CG effects -- it somehow doesn't feel that the demand for neat heroes and villains is one of them.<\/p><p>Norris and his ilk would submit that in our current period of ideological and geopolitical upheaval, in a time of blurry lines between enemies and friends in places such as Afghanistan and Iraq, that black-and-white heroes slake a patriotic thirst (and that, indeed, the movie-going world can support a lot more of them). But history argues the opposite: Those movies succeed when the culture at large is filled with clear-cut distinctions. On the other hand, when the zeitgeist is more cloudy, an entirely different kind of cinema prospers.<\/p><p>The post-WWII era and its mainly straightforward distinctions between good and evil, to take an example of the former, yielded a flowering subgenre of movies with morally uncomplicated gunslingers. And 30 years later, the ideological simplicity of the Cold War and its larger-than-life Evil Empire gave rise to the very action movies on which \"Expendables\" is modeled (not to mention the ultimate in us-versus-them confections, \"Rocky IV.\" Yes, there's a Stallone-ishness to all of this). There are plenty of reasons why these types of movies faded from view in the 1990s, but the fall of the Berlin Wall and the the Soviet Union certainly played a part.<\/p><p>The examples are just as abundant on the other side. The ambiguities of the Vietnam War and the counterculture in the late 1960s and early 1970s undoubtedly offered up the moral murkiness of<\/p><p>\"Midnight Cowboy\" and scores of others. In the post-9\/11 world, meanwhile, movies like<\/p><p>-- with its themes of a destruction-bent enemy that can't be bargained with, and the question of what constitutes an acceptable ethical compromise in fighting that enemy -- have captured our imagination. You can throw<\/p><p>in there too, to the degree the movie was a contemplation of Western interests in the Middle East.<\/p><p>Political eras are, of course, rarely just one thing or another, and the movies we want to see in a given period are hardly monolithic. But as tempting as it is to infer that the success of \"The Expendables\" shows a deeper cultural need, it may well be the wrong inference. When times are confusing, we want movies to reflect that confusion, and even to make sense of it.

With Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, Connie Nielsen, Oliver Reed. Directed by Ridley Scott. At area theaters. Running time: 154 mins. Rated R: Gory violence, incest theme. 3 1\/2 Stars.<\/p><p>If there's a soft spot in your heart for the sword-&-sandal epic - and from the star rating above, I think you can guess where I stand - then you'll swoon with giddy delight over \"Gladiator,\" a sweaty, stylish hunkfest that takes you back to the days of \"Ben-Hur,\" \"Spartacus\" and the so recently departed Steve Reeves.<\/p><p>From his biceps to his gluteus, Maximus is maximus. This Roman general turned slave turned gladiator hasn't a shred of humor, but then, he doesn't have time for idle nonsense when he's lopping off heads all day. (The head-lopping is apparently his signature, like the mark of Zorro.)<\/p><p>In director Ridley Scott's thrilling, burnished epic, Maximus no sooner serves the empire by leveling Germania during a snowstorm than Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) tosses him a promotion he doesn't want - to succeed the aged emperor and whip Rome back into shape. All Maximus wants is to go home to his wife and child in the suburbs.<\/p><p>The careworn Russell Crowe is physically and temperamentally perfect for the part of Maximus. Still carrying some of the weight he packed on for \"The Insider,\" he's no gym-toned pretty boy. He's solid, beefy, rough-hewn, creaking along in his heavy leather costume, with a look on his puss of weary disdain.<\/p><p>What makes him sexy is his sense of honor and loyalty: \"What we do in life echoes in eternity!\" Anyway, it can't be his hygiene, although he is frequently bathed in a sanctifying golden glow.<\/p><p>After a coup by the emperor's weak-kneed son, Commodus (a whiny, surprisingly fleshy Joaquin Phoenix), Maximus' fortunes change. He winds up being thrown to the tigers, two shows daily, in Rome's Colosseum, the entertainment complex of its day.<\/p><p>Crowe, like his character, must grimly come to terms with the fact that, actor or gladiator, it's all about showmanship. Give the crowd what it wants, either at the multiplex or in the arena, and you can write your own ticket.<\/p><p>\"I have power only to amuse the mob,\" he spits contemptuously like a Shakespearean actor reduced to dinner theater.<\/p><p>The plot, about avenging honor, provides brief respite between an array of hand-to-hand battles that are pitched so furiously that individual components barely register; they're subliminal suggestions of computer-assisted carnage, with Jackson Pollock sprays of blood. For fans of the genre, yes, this is a good thing.<\/p><p>Connie Nielsen plays Commodus' sister and possible love interest for Maximus once his family is dispatched (politics, you know). Nielsen's costumes are laced up like bondage gear, and there is a tantalizing hint of romance past.<\/p><p>But the camera only has eyes for Crowe. The glowering! The seething! The hooded gaze! The quiet suffering! (Watch him carve away a tattoo he no longer has use for. No anesthetic! No disinfectant!)<\/p><p>The supporting cast makes for a gauntlet of worthy friends and adversaries, all of them thinkers, including Derek Jacobi (\"I, Claudius\") as a senator, Djimon Hounsou (\"Amistad\") as a fellow gladiator and Oliver Reed, who died with two days to go on the shoot, looking a little woozy as a gladiator entrepreneur.<\/p><p>Reed's character is the one most in touch with the movie's premise - that entertainment is the goal, and a worthy one at that.","156":"NEW YORK -- Ruben Tejada thinks Chase Utley's late slide that broke his right leg was dirty.<\/p><p>Speaking about the play for the first time since Utley ended Tejada's season in Game 2 of the NL Division Series against the Los Angeles Dodgers, the Mets shortstop said he's no longer upset over it.<\/p><p>Using a blue cane adorned with a Mets logo giving to him by the team's owners, Tejada hung out with teammates in the dugout before Game 4 of the World Series.<\/p><p>He says he's come to terms with what happened, even though he never responded to the message Utley sent him through captain David Wright.

Within two days on the market, however, there were 10 offers. \"Our was not the highest,\" Stephanie said. \"We wrote a letter to the owners about why we liked the house.\"<\/p><p>The letter, along with a photograph of the family, worked. What drew the Stahlbergs to the house were the solar panels and the trees and bushes \u2014 raspberries, blueberries, blackberries, strawberries, grapes, apples, plums and currants \u2014 growing organically on the property. The Stahlbergs also envisioned finishing the basement bedroom and bathroom for an au pair.<\/p><p>They also fell in love with the neighborhood. They would be within walking distance to a park and two libraries with story time for children.<\/p><p>\"We were trying to look at homes where we can walk to the Metro, or bike to the city or to the Metro,\" said Stephanie, 27.<\/p><p>Sears and Montgomery Ward kit houses: Cherrydale, once abundant with cherry orchards, is a family neighborhood dating to 1893. While many neighbors have lived in the area for as long as 60 years, newcomers move in and out these days, said Kathryn Holt Springston, who worked for the Smithsonian American History Tours Office as an educational specialist and historian for 28 years. She also served as curator and director of the Arlington Historical Museum and editor of the Cherrydale Citizens' Association newsletter.<\/p><p>Single-family homes, the Arlington public schools, access to bike trails and proximity to the District draw people to the neighborhood. Sometimes, though, they move in but stay only a few years. Finding a house in Cherrydale can involve the competitive process the Stahlbergs experienced.<\/p><p>About half a mile north of the Virginia Square and Ballston Metro stations on the Orange and Silver lines, Cherrydale has a variety of residences ranging from farmhouses to bungalows to Sears and Montgomery Ward kit homes with two to five or bedrooms or sometimes more. Many date from 1900 to 1930, though some of the older houses were purchased to be torn down and replaced with larger homes, including some built as recently as this year.<\/p><p>Living there: Cherrydale lies north of Interstate 66 and south of Lorcom Lane, stretching roughly from Utah Street on the west to the northward-curving interstate on the east. The Maywood neighborhood claims the eastern half of those boundaries north of Lee Highway, lending something of an arrowhead shape to Cherrydale. Since 1908, the Cherrydale Citizens' Association has planned activities and resolved neighborhood concerns. In the 1970s and 1980s, people often referred to the neighborhood as Mayberry, according to Springston, 63. In 1948, her parents bought the house where she lives with her husband and son. It dates to 1890, Springston said.<\/p><p>In the neighborhood, 49 properties sold in the past year, according to Billy Buck, an associate broker at Buck & Associates. The lowest priced was a one-bedroom, one-bath condominium for $200,000; the highest priced was a five-bedroom, five-bath farmhouse at $1.63 million. Twelve properties are on the market now, ranging from a one-bedroom, two-bath condo for $274,900 to a new five-bedroom, five-bath Craftsman house at $1.799 million.<\/p><p>Welcome wagon: The five-points intersection \u2014 Lee Highway, Old Dominion Drive, Quincy Street, Military Road and Quebec Street \u2014 is dotted with at least two car dealerships and other commercial establishments while nearby is a Safeway and the Cherrydale Hardware, which opened in 1938.<\/p><p>The Cherrydale Volunteer Fire House, built in 1919, is home to such events as the annual spaghetti dinner, concerts and for 90 years each December there is a visit from Santa Claus for children under 12. Other community events are the annual Fourth of July party and picnic at 21st and Stafford streets. A neighborhood with its own \"welcome wagon,\" Cherrydale has approximately 1,400 households and three parks as well as the Martha Custis Trail for biking, running and walking.<\/p><p>Schools: Glebe Elementary, Taylor Elementary, Swanson Middle, Kenmore Middle and Washington-Lee High.<\/p><p>Transit: The neighborhood is close to the Virginia Square or Ballston Metro stops on the Orange and Silver lines. Metro and Arlington Transit buses connect at Ballston and Virginia Square. Capital Bikeshare also is available.<\/p><p>Crime: From July 2014 through June 2015, according to Arlington County police, one robbery and two burglaries were reported in the area.<\/p><p>Harriet Edleson is a freelance writer.","158":"Writer-director Richard Linklater has described his latest film, \"Everybody Wants Some!!,\" as a \"spiritual sequel\" to 1993's \"Dazed and Confused.\" That made my heart fibrillate a little, and maybe yours too. Beginning with its shot of a Pontiac GTO pulling doughnuts in a high school parking lot to Aerosmith's \"Sweet Emotion,\" \"Dazed\" is such a humane approximation of what it was like to come of age in the mid-1970s that one wishes it would never end. On the evidence of \"Boyhood\" and the \"Before Sunrise\" trilogy, though, Linklater doesn't want any of his movies to end. Thus \"Everybody Wants Some!!\"<\/p><p>Which at first is different, sometimes jarringly so, before wading into the open-armed embrace of experience that marks this filmmaker's finest work. The tipoffs are those double exclamation points and an onscreen title font that recalls a Skinemax late-night movie circa 1981. What if you took one of that era's hormone-drenched stu-coms and put real people in it?<\/p><p>The year is 1980, actually, and Jake (Blake Jenner from \"Glee\") is arriving for his freshman year at (the fictional) Southeastern Texas State University. A high school pitching star and rangy college prospect, he's assigned an off-campus baseball dorm with the other players. It's a ready-made animal house, with rules laid down by a briefly seen coach (Jonathan Breck) that are immediately ignored. Occasionally we'll get an onscreen reminder of how many dwindling days and hours remain before classes begin. These, too, are ignored.<\/p><p>Instead, Linklater parks his cameras to observe, with indulgence and much good humor, the bonding rituals of young men who only think they have it figured out. Jake's housemates fall into general categories that re-sort themselves into individual personalities: The motor-mouthed ladies' man Finnegan (Glen Powell), the Zen surfer-stoner Willoughby (Wyatt Russell), uber-competitive McReynolds (Tyler Hoechlin), country rube Billy (Will Brittain), smartass Nesbit (Austin Amelio), na\u00efve Brumley (Tanner Kalina). And so on.<\/p><p>A few stand slightly outside the pack: the over-confident psycho-nerd pitcher Jay Niles (Juston Street, freakily funny) and the laconic second base star Dale Douglas (J. Quinton Johnson), whose blackness is rarely commented on. Where are the women? There to be chased and partied with and seduced. \"This is college, Jake,\" the hero is told early on. \"The girls can be as big sluts as the guys.\"<\/p><p>Oh, dear. Is \"Everybody Wants Some!!\" what happens when you people an entire Richard Linklater movie with Matthew McConaughey's horndog Wooderson from \"Dazed and Confused\"? Yes and no, or, rather, yes, but only at first. As the boys sprawl through the last days of summer, the swagger that borders on smug begins to mellow and melt away. Searching for good times and girls, they hop from a disco one night to a country and western bar the next to a punk mosh pit to an art-student costume party, minds open, adapting, ever-changing. After a while, the hero starts having a smallish identity crisis, confessing that \"it sort of begs the question of who we are.\"<\/p><p>Well, yes. This is college, Jake. Even a high school sports star can be anyone he wants.<\/p><p>The movie eventually spins him off from the crowd into the arms of Beverly (Zoey Deutch), a tartly ardent stage arts freshman with Joni Mitchell posters on her wall. She's unpretentious for a theater brat, he's smart and soulful for a jock, and the two stand dazzled in the Venn diagram overlap of their attraction. These scenes try a little too hard to be charming but they are anyway, and if Deutch has the freckles and immediacy of a classic Brat Pack heroine, it may be because her mother is Lea Thompson of \"Back to the Future\" and \"Some Kind of Wonderful\" and her father is Howard Deutch, who directed the latter.<\/p><p>More second-generation pleasures: Wyatt Russell, who plays the woolly baseball mystic Willoughby, is the son of Kurt Russell and Goldie Hawn, and he has a high old time \u2014 emphasis on high \u2014 explaining to his teammates why \"Fearless,\" from the 1971 album \"Meddle,\" is the best track that Pink Floyd ever recorded. Because he is correct, I am awarding \"Everybody Wants Some!!\" an extra half-star.<\/p><p>Linklater was a high school baseball player who went to Sam Houston State on a scholarship, and the movie is steeped in the lazy, rivalrous minutiae of college ball. Willoughby gets off a moment of bliss when he muses on the pleasures of pitching \u2014 \"It's lovely out there on the bump,\" he says \u2014 and we learn that it's the .230 hitters who are always the most superstitious. Also that it's possible to slice a pitched baseball in half with an ax. At one point, one of the characters gazes with incredulity at a crowd of fellow students and says, \"I know what we're doing here. We're playing baseball. What are they doing here?\"<\/p><p>\"Everybody Wants Some!!\" is a nice long soak in the Proustian detritus of its era. Beverly drives a Gremlin, Jake knows the secret of winning at \"Space Invaders,\" and people can still confidently begin sentences with the words, \"It's like Carl Sagan says. . .\" What \"Sweet Emotion\" was to \"Dazed and Confused,\" so the Knack's \"My Sharona\" is to this movie, and the soundtrack rolls forward from there: glorious junk from the days when Eddie Rabbitt, Eddie Money, Sniff 'n' the Tears, and the BusBoys meant something.<\/p><p>All that's missing is a plot. But Linklater doesn't do plot; he does life. Says Powell's garrulous Finnegan, summing up the art of both this movie and this moviemaker, \"I don't think at all. I just talk a lot. It's jazz improv. You're invited.\" And so are we.<\/p><p>Written and directed by Richard Linklater. Starring Blake Jenner, Zoey Deutch, Glen Powell, Wyatt Russell, Tyler Hoechlin, Juston Street.

In theory, the Democratic officials who run the state's election offices could object to Mr. Akin's request for a court order, a move that would force a hearing before a judge.<\/p><p>The relevant statute says someone like Mr. Akin can withdraw \"pursuant to a court order, which, except for good cause shown by the election authority in opposition thereto, shall be freely given upon application by the candidate to the circuit court in the county of such candidate's residence.\"<\/p><p>Election officials say they can find no precedent at all for such an objection in the state's history. But Ms. Carnahan is herself a factor in Republican minds. As the Democratic Senate nominee in 2010, she lost to Representative Roy Blunt, and Republicans imagine she could put up a fight.<\/p><p>\"The secretary's job is to protect the rights of Missouri voters,\" Ms. Temple said when asked whether Ms. Carnahan would fight a court order to remove Mr. Akin's name from the ballot.<\/p><p>A further complication: Under state law, any election authority in Missouri can oppose a withdrawal order, down to the county and city level, and there are Democrats aplenty in Missouri. But Ms. Temple added that right now, it would be up to a Missouri court to determine whether Mr. Akin could withdraw, not the secretary of state.<\/p><p>\"It's completely in the hands of the court to decide the facts,\" she said.<\/p><p>Assuming Mr. Akin does manage to drop out, the state central committee of the Republican Party in Missouri would have to pick a new candidate within 28 days, or by Oct. 12, whichever comes first.","162":"I think there's a real possibility that there's going to be a substantial realignment in the political scene in this country, especially if nothing is done to satisfy these dissatisfied people.<\/p><p>The Trump phenomenon is really a reflection of what happened in the referendum, to some extent, and so is Podemos and so is Syriza and so is the Front National in France.<\/p><p>Unless the western world can somehow or other satisfy large numbers of its people that it can run the economy and the country in a way which is in their interests, I think you are going to finish up with this discontent.<\/p><p>If we are going to save liberal democracy, it's very important that something is done to get it back on track again.","163":"While living in an apartment in Pentagon City, Stephanie Gimenez Stahlberg and her husband, Patrick Stahlberg, a software engineer, began searching for a house where they could raise their family.<\/p><p>With two children \u2014 now 31\/2 and 1 1\/2 \u2014 the Stahlbergs needed more space, including a study area for Stephanie, who is enrolled in a PhD program at the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies.<\/p><p>The house they found in Cherrydale, a neighborhood in North Arlington, met their expectations. Within two days on the market, however, there were 10 offers. \"Our was not the highest,\" Stephanie said. \"We wrote a letter to the owners about why we liked the house.\"<\/p><p>The letter, along with a photograph of the family, worked. What drew the Stahlbergs to the house were the solar panels and the trees and bushes \u2014 raspberries, blueberries, blackberries, strawberries, grapes, apples, plums and currants \u2014 growing organically on the property. The Stahlbergs also envisioned finishing the basement bedroom and bathroom for an au pair.<\/p><p>They also fell in love with the neighborhood. They would be within walking distance to a park and two libraries with story time for children.<\/p><p>\"We were trying to look at homes where we can walk to the Metro, or bike to the city or to the Metro,\" said Stephanie, 27.<\/p><p>Sears and Montgomery Ward kit houses: Cherrydale, once abundant with cherry orchards, is a family neighborhood dating to 1893. While many neighbors have lived in the area for as long as 60 years, newcomers move in and out these days, said Kathryn Holt Springston, who worked for the Smithsonian American History Tours Office as an educational specialist and historian for 28 years. She also served as curator and director of the Arlington Historical Museum and editor of the Cherrydale Citizens' Association newsletter.<\/p><p>Single-family homes, the Arlington public schools, access to bike trails and proximity to the District draw people to the neighborhood. Sometimes, though, they move in but stay only a few years. Finding a house in Cherrydale can involve the competitive process the Stahlbergs experienced.<\/p><p>About half a mile north of the Virginia Square and Ballston Metro stations on the Orange and Silver lines, Cherrydale has a variety of residences ranging from farmhouses to bungalows to Sears and Montgomery Ward kit homes with two to five or bedrooms or sometimes more. Many date from 1900 to 1930, though some of the older houses were purchased to be torn down and replaced with larger homes, including some built as recently as this year.<\/p><p>Living there: Cherrydale lies north of Interstate 66 and south of Lorcom Lane, stretching roughly from Utah Street on the west to the northward-curving interstate on the east. The Maywood neighborhood claims the eastern half of those boundaries north of Lee Highway, lending something of an arrowhead shape to Cherrydale. Since 1908, the Cherrydale Citizens' Association has planned activities and resolved neighborhood concerns. In the 1970s and 1980s, people often referred to the neighborhood as Mayberry, according to Springston, 63. In 1948, her parents bought the house where she lives with her husband and son. It dates to 1890, Springston said.<\/p><p>In the neighborhood, 49 properties sold in the past year, according to Billy Buck, an associate broker at Buck & Associates. The lowest priced was a one-bedroom, one-bath condominium for $200,000; the highest priced was a five-bedroom, five-bath farmhouse at $1.63 million. Twelve properties are on the market now, ranging from a one-bedroom, two-bath condo for $274,900 to a new five-bedroom, five-bath Craftsman house at $1.799 million.<\/p><p>Welcome wagon: The five-points intersection \u2014 Lee Highway, Old Dominion Drive, Quincy Street, Military Road and Quebec Street \u2014 is dotted with at least two car dealerships and other commercial establishments while nearby is a Safeway and the Cherrydale Hardware, which opened in 1938.<\/p><p>The Cherrydale Volunteer Fire House, built in 1919, is home to such events as the annual spaghetti dinner, concerts and for 90 years each December there is a visit from Santa Claus for children under 12. Other community events are the annual Fourth of July party and picnic at 21st and Stafford streets. A neighborhood with its own \"welcome wagon,\" Cherrydale has approximately 1,400 households and three parks as well as the Martha Custis Trail for biking, running and walking.<\/p><p>Schools: Glebe Elementary, Taylor Elementary, Swanson Middle, Kenmore Middle and Washington-Lee High.<\/p><p>Transit: The neighborhood is close to the Virginia Square or Ballston Metro stops on the Orange and Silver lines. Metro and Arlington Transit buses connect at Ballston and Virginia Square. Capital Bikeshare also is available.<\/p><p>Crime: From July 2014 through June 2015, according to Arlington County police, one robbery and two burglaries were reported in the area.<\/p><p>Harriet Edleson is a freelance writer.","164":"The White House tried Sunday to win support for President Obama's forthcoming budget, arguing the plan is a balanced approach to economic prosperity and warning Republicans about stonewalling negotiations and pushing a \"rejected\" Romney plan.<\/p><p>\"Right now, the approach of many Republicans, particularly the leadership in the House, is my way or the highway,\" senior White House adviser Dan Pfeiffer told \"Fox News Sunday.\" \"Their view is the only acceptable plan is to try to \u2026 essentially enact the Romney economic plan.

Small businesses and families starving for credit will eventually get relief as the funding props up banks and they increase lending, but Rajoy didn't offer guidance on when.<\/p><p>Spain on Saturday became the fourth \u2014 and largest \u2014 of the 17 countries that use Europe's common currency to request a bailout \u2014 a big blow to a nation that a few years ago took pride as the continent's economic superstar only to see it become the hot spot in the eurozone debt crisis. Its economy is the eurozone's fourth largest after Germany, France and Italy.<\/p><p>Across the country, Spaniards reacted with a mixture of anger and relief to the news. The amount of the rescue fund, if all is tapped, amounts to \u20ac21,000 of new debt for each person in the nation of 47 million where the average annual salary for those with work is about the same amount and the unemployment rate for those under age 25 is 52 percent.<\/p><p>The country is already reeling from deep austerity cuts Rajoy has imposed over the last six months that have raised taxes, made it easier to hire and fire workers, and cut deep into cherished government programs including education and national health care.<\/p><p>\"It's obviously a shame,\" said civil servant Luisa Saraguren, 44, as she strolled on a sunny Sunday morning with her young daughter. \"But this bailout was fully predictable, and the consequences of this help are going to be a lot bigger compared to the cuts we've been living with already.\"<\/p><p>Rajoy took pains to avoid the word bailout Sunday, saying Spain's rescue package is a line of credit that its most troubled banks will be able to tap. The assistance will not come with the outside control over government macroeconomic policy like that imposed Greece, Ireland and Portugal when their public finances were bailed out.<\/p><p>He said interest rates on the loans will be considerably lower than the rate near 7 percent that Spain has been forced to pay recently on the international debt markets, a level that forced the other countries to seek bailouts.<\/p><p>Spain will regain the economic credibility it has lost by shoring up its banks, which will result in credit being restored so businesses and individuals shut off from loans can start borrowing and the economy will grow again, Rajoy insisted, again without saying when.<\/p><p>Europe's widening recession and financial crisis has hurt companies and investors around the world. Providing a financial lifeline to Spanish banks is likely to relieve anxiety on the Spanish economy \u2014 which is five times larger than Greece's \u2014 and on markets concerned about the country's ability to pay its way.<\/p><p>Spain's financial problems are not due to Greek-style government over-spending. The country's banks particularly its savings banks or \"cajas,\" got caught up in the collapse of a real estate bubble in 2008 that got worse over the past four years. However, as Spain's leaders have struggled for a solution to their banking crisis, the country's borrowing costs have soared close to the level that forced the governments of Greece, Portugal and Ireland to seek rescues.<\/p><p>Some of Spain's banks are struggling with by toxic real estate loans and assets amid fears the problem will get worse as more jobless people can't pay their mortgages. The Bank of Spain says the toxic loans and assets total around \u20ac180 billion. Nationalized lender Bankia SA, which has requested \u20ac19 billion in aid, has \u20ac32 billion in toxic assets. Around four other banks serving the domestic market are considered prime candidates for bailouts.<\/p><p>\"I could never get my mind round the scale of consumption in Spain over the past 20 years, having known it in the 1960s when it was still extremely poor,\" said Paul Preston, a history professor and expert on Spain with the London School of Economics. \"Lots of people enjoyed the consumer boom, but not everybody. Now everybody's having to pay for it.\"<\/p><p>Rajoy blamed Spain's woes on the previous Socialist administration of Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero without mentioning him or his government by name. Zapatero was ousted by Rajoy in a landslide last November by voters outraged over the Socialist handling of the economy.<\/p><p>\"Last year Spain's public administration spent \u20ac90 billion more than it took in, this can't be maintained, we can't live like that,\" Rajoy said.<\/p><p>But Socialist Party leader Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba said Rajoy should acknowledge that Spain is now in bailout territory.<\/p><p>\"The government is trying to make us believe that we've won the lottery, that the Three Kings of Orient have arrived, and that isn't so,\" Rubalcaba said.<\/p><p>After his press conference, Rajoy defended his decision to jet off an hour later to Poland to see Spain's famed national football team take on Italy in the Euro 2012 competition. He said he would be on the ground in Gdansk only for the game before flying back to Madrid Sunday night.<\/p><p>\"I'll be there two and a half hours and then I'll leave,\" Rajoy said. \"I think the national team deserves it.\"","167":"The Coworking Resources Series is supported by join.me.

Though coworking can have a lot of perks, how you take advantage of them and shape your experience is up to you.<\/p><p>\"We've had people who within the first week they've kind of immersed themselves [in]to events and socializing with other people here, or they're just here, they do their work, and then they take off,\" says Jeff Park, who manages the Ravenswood Coworking Group in Chicago. \"We know that they come in, but I think for them that's enough for them. They just want to be around other people in a productive environment.\"<\/p><p>Whether you're aiming to be as productive as possible without a lot of socializing or trying to build a strong professional community that you can turn to for resources and support, these five tips can help you get the most out of your coworking experience.<\/p><p>Green Spaces, a coworking space in Tribeca, specializes in environmentally focused businesses. Mountain View-based Cubes & Crayons combines childcare and coworking. WorkBar in Boston is hosted in a 2,500-square-foot space and has separate areas for cafe-like and quieter working styles. Coworking Brooklyn uses a small room that functions as an art gallery by night.<\/p><p>The coworking experience varies drastically depending on which space you're using. Different spaces have different levels of interaction with other workers, formality and general vibe. While some spaces, like Green Spaces and Cubes & Crayons, state their niche upfront, you'll only be able to gauge what the environment is like by dropping in. Most spaces have daily drop-in rates. Try a couple of different spaces to see what works best for you before you commit. You can find a list of space around the world on the Coworking Wiki.<\/p><p>\"See if the people in the space are people who you could go and see every day\u2026if it's not, then go to the next space,\" says Jay Catalan, the co-founder of a coworking space in Vancouver called The Network Hub.<\/p><p>It's less awkward to introduce yourself on the first day than to work alongside someone for months before asking their name. Even if you're not usually outgoing, try to make a special effort for the first week or two when you start in a new coworking space.<\/p><p>\"Just make introductions and it goes a long way\u2026We've had some people they wish they had met sooner because it turns out they did similar lines of work and just talking about it or actually sharing work, it's not something you want to find out when you only have a couple more months left on your project or something,\" Park says.<\/p><p>If you're shy about meeting people, try getting creative (like, for instance, bringing food). Bill Jacobson and Dave Ulrich, who co-founded WorkBar, said that one new coworker at WorkBar Boston showed up with a big box of doughnuts. \"He got to know everybody pretty quick,\" Jacobson says.<\/p><p>Don't stop interacting with your coworkers after you introduce yourself. One of the biggest benefits of coworking is the built-in community of professionals working across different industries.<\/p><p>\"It may not seem directly 'productive' to chat with your coworker for 10 minutes mid-day, but indirectly, it yields greater results than almost anything else you could spend time on,\" says Parker Whitney, office manager for Philadelphia coworking space Independents Hall, though he says, \"Invest in your community by taking (not faking) interest in what its members do, and it will take you with it\u2026The people you've always wanted to know are sitting all around you. Ask questions. Learn. Most importantly, help them when you can.\"<\/p><p>If you are too busy during the workday for water cooler conversation, most coworking spaces host happy hours, seminars or other events that are prime opportunities for learning more about your coworkers.<\/p><p>\"Even when you work for yourself, it's important to realize your limitations,\" says Dave Martorana, a freelance Python & iPhone developer who works at Independents Hall. \"If you're a software developer, you're not necessarily a designer, product manager, or marketer as well.

Monsanto mon says it is not considering physical barriers like fences or guards.<\/p><p>The FBI and the U.S. Justice Department say cases of espionage in the agriculture sector have been growing since Mo was first discovered digging in an Iowan field in May 2011. Over the past two years, U.S. companies, government research facilities and universities have all been targeted, according to the FBI.<\/p><p>Although prosecutors were unable to establish a Chinese government link to Mo's group, the case adds to U.S.-China frictions over what Washington says is increasing economic espionage and trade secret theft by Beijing and its proxies.<\/p><p>A U.S. law enforcement official told Reuters the agency looked for a connection between the Chinese government and the conspiracy carried out by Mo.<\/p><p>\"In cases like this, we can see connections, but proving to the threshold needed in court requires that we have documents that the government has directed this,\" the official said. \"It's almost impossible to get.\"<\/p><p>A Chinese embassy spokesman in Washington, Zhu Haiquan, said he did not have detailed information on the Mo case but that China \"stands firm\" on the protection of intellectual property and maintains \"constant communication and cooperation\" with the U.S. government on the issue.<\/p><p>On his visit to Washington last September, President Xi Jinping reiterated China's denial of any government role in the hacking of U.S. corporate secrets.<\/p><p>Mo, an employee of Chinese firm Kings Nower Seed, pleaded guilty to stealing seed grown by U.S. firms Monsanto, Dupont Pioneer dd and LG Seeds.<\/p><p>Prosecutors say he specifically targeted fields that grow the parent seeds needed to replicate GMO corn. The FBI says it suspects he was given the location by workers for the seed companies, but did not charge any employees.<\/p><p>DuPont Pioneer and LG Seeds declined to comment for this story.<\/p><p>Mo, whose case was prosecuted by the Justice Department as a national security matter rather than a simple criminal case, now faces a sentence of up to five years in prison. Five others charged in the case are still wanted by the FBI and are believed to have fled to China or Argentina. Charges were dropped against a sixth Chinese suspect.<\/p><p>The number of international economic espionage cases referred to the FBI is rising, up 15% each year between 2009 and 2014 and up 53% in 2015. The majority of cases reported involve Chinese nationals, the U.S. law enforcement official told Reuters. In the agriculture sector, organic insecticide, irrigation equipment and rice, along with corn, are all suspected to have been targeted, including by Chinese nationals, the official said.<\/p><p>Mo Hongjian, vice president of Kings Nower Seed's parent company, Beijing Dabeinong Technology Group, declined to comment on the case or on the company's connection with the Chinese government.<\/p><p>The parent firm is privately owned, but says it receives government money for research in \"science and technology.\"<\/p><p>China bans commercial growing of GMO grains due to public opposition to the technology and imports of GMO corn have to be approved by the agriculture ministry. Still, President Xi called in 2014 for China to innovate and dominate the technique, which promises high yields through resistance to drought, pests and disease.<\/p><p>In January, a Greenpeace report found some Chinese farmers are illegally growing GMO corn whose strains belong to companies including Monsanto, Syngenta syt and DuPont Pioneer.<\/p><p>Monsanto, which supplies Burrack's seed, said it can block foreign groups who request to tour their lab and learning center in Huxley, Iowa. For the past few years, Monsanto says it has run its own background checks on Chinese delegations that ask for a tour, and, if they are approved, boosts security to be sure they do not steal anything or take pictures.<\/p><p>In Washington, U.S. senators have called for a review of the $43 billion deal by state-owned ChemChina to buy Swiss seed group Syngenta, which generates nearly a quarter of its revenue from North America.<\/p><p>Acquiring GMO seed and successfully recreating a corn plant would allow Chinese companies to skip over roughly eight years of research and $1.5 billion spent annually by Monsanto to develop the corn, the company says.<\/p><p>Burrack's farm itself was not targeted by Mo, though he grows the Monsanto parent seed that the Chinese national was digging for. Burrack grows the corn in two fields in front of and behind his house where he can watch them, a small part of his 2,800-acre farm.<\/p><p>He said he is told by Monsanto where and when to plant the parent seed, but has never been told to keep what he is planting a secret.<\/p><p>\"What no one seems to understand is that they're stealing from people like me,\" Burrack said. \"They're stealing the research that farmers pay for when they buy Monsanto seed.\"","169":"Despite the firestorm over his comments about rape and pregnancy, Representative Todd Akin says he has no plans to drop out as the Republican Senate nominee in Missouri.<\/p><p>But what if he did?<\/p><p>The procedures in Missouri to change nominees midstream are complicated and intended to discourage just the sort of change that many in the Republican Party say they are eager to see happen.<\/p><p>\"As more time passes, you're starting to go up against deadlines,\" said Stacie Temple, a spokeswoman for Missouri's secretary of state, Robin Carnahan, a Democrat. Ms. Temple said the longer Mr. Akin waited, the more difficult it would get.<\/p><p>The first deadline for Mr. Akin to have easily withdrawn from the race was Tuesday evening. His decision to stay in the race means that he now has only a few weeks to reconsider before things get even harder.<\/p><p>Certification of the presidential ballots in Missouri will be no later than Sept. 17, and could be shortly after President Obama officially accepts the Democratic nomination on Sept. 5.<\/p><p>Once the ballots are printed, any candidate who seeks to withdraw must pay for the reprinting of new ballots. That could be prohibitively expensive for Mr. Akin, but presumably the Republican Party \u2014 which badly wants him to withdraw \u2014 would cover the cost.<\/p><p>Military overseas ballots begin shipping out Sept. 22. That might be the first firm deadline. But the drop-dead deadline is Sept. 25, when general absentee ballots are sent out.<\/p><p>Mel Carnahan, the former Missouri governor and Ms. Carnahan's father, died on Oct. 16, 2000, during his campaign for the Senate against the Republican incumbent, John Ashcroft. Mr. Carnahan's name nonetheless appeared on the ballot in November \u2014 and he won. (His widow, Jean, was appointed to the seat, and lost it in special election in 2002.)<\/p><p>Assuming that Mr. Akin bows to pressure from Republican leaders (or simply concludes that he isn't able to raise enough money to mount a credible campaign), Missouri law requires that he seek a court order allowing him to drop out of the race.<\/p><p>State officials say that issuing such court orders is routine. Mr. Akin would merely have to file the necessary papers with the court and his name would no longer be printed on the November ballot. Republicans could then quickly nominate someone else to run against Senator Claire McCaskill, the Democratic incumbent.<\/p><p>Democrats would no doubt like to see Mr. Akin \u2014 now politically weakened by his comments on rape and pregnancy \u2014 stay in the race. In theory, the Democratic officials who run the state's election offices could object to Mr. Akin's request for a court order, a move that would force a hearing before a judge.<\/p><p>The relevant statute says someone like Mr. Akin can withdraw \"pursuant to a court order, which, except for good cause shown by the election authority in opposition thereto, shall be freely given upon application by the candidate to the circuit court in the county of such candidate's residence.\"<\/p><p>Election officials say they can find no precedent at all for such an objection in the state's history. But Ms. Carnahan is herself a factor in Republican minds. As the Democratic Senate nominee in 2010, she lost to Representative Roy Blunt, and Republicans imagine she could put up a fight.<\/p><p>\"The secretary's job is to protect the rights of Missouri voters,\" Ms. Temple said when asked whether Ms. Carnahan would fight a court order to remove Mr. Akin's name from the ballot.<\/p><p>A further complication: Under state law, any election authority in Missouri can oppose a withdrawal order, down to the county and city level, and there are Democrats aplenty in Missouri. But Ms. Temple added that right now, it would be up to a Missouri court to determine whether Mr. Akin could withdraw, not the secretary of state.<\/p><p>\"It's completely in the hands of the court to decide the facts,\" she said.<\/p><p>Assuming Mr. Akin does manage to drop out, the state central committee of the Republican Party in Missouri would have to pick a new candidate within 28 days, or by Oct. 12, whichever comes first.","170":"While living in an apartment in Pentagon City, Stephanie Gimenez Stahlberg and her husband, Patrick Stahlberg, a software engineer, began searching for a house where they could raise their family.<\/p><p>With two children \u2014 now 31\/2 and 1 1\/2 \u2014 the Stahlbergs needed more space, including a study area for Stephanie, who is enrolled in a PhD program at the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies.<\/p><p>The house they found in Cherrydale, a neighborhood in North Arlington, met their expectations. Within two days on the market, however, there were 10 offers. \"Our was not the highest,\" Stephanie said. \"We wrote a letter to the owners about why we liked the house.\"<\/p><p>The letter, along with a photograph of the family, worked. What drew the Stahlbergs to the house were the solar panels and the trees and bushes \u2014 raspberries, blueberries, blackberries, strawberries, grapes, apples, plums and currants \u2014 growing organically on the property. The Stahlbergs also envisioned finishing the basement bedroom and bathroom for an au pair.<\/p><p>They also fell in love with the neighborhood. They would be within walking distance to a park and two libraries with story time for children.<\/p><p>\"We were trying to look at homes where we can walk to the Metro, or bike to the city or to the Metro,\" said Stephanie, 27.<\/p><p>Sears and Montgomery Ward kit houses: Cherrydale, once abundant with cherry orchards, is a family neighborhood dating to 1893. While many neighbors have lived in the area for as long as 60 years, newcomers move in and out these days, said Kathryn Holt Springston, who worked for the Smithsonian American History Tours Office as an educational specialist and historian for 28 years. She also served as curator and director of the Arlington Historical Museum and editor of the Cherrydale Citizens' Association newsletter.<\/p><p>Single-family homes, the Arlington public schools, access to bike trails and proximity to the District draw people to the neighborhood. Sometimes, though, they move in but stay only a few years. Finding a house in Cherrydale can involve the competitive process the Stahlbergs experienced.<\/p><p>About half a mile north of the Virginia Square and Ballston Metro stations on the Orange and Silver lines, Cherrydale has a variety of residences ranging from farmhouses to bungalows to Sears and Montgomery Ward kit homes with two to five or bedrooms or sometimes more. Many date from 1900 to 1930, though some of the older houses were purchased to be torn down and replaced with larger homes, including some built as recently as this year.<\/p><p>Living there: Cherrydale lies north of Interstate 66 and south of Lorcom Lane, stretching roughly from Utah Street on the west to the northward-curving interstate on the east. The Maywood neighborhood claims the eastern half of those boundaries north of Lee Highway, lending something of an arrowhead shape to Cherrydale. Since 1908, the Cherrydale Citizens' Association has planned activities and resolved neighborhood concerns. In the 1970s and 1980s, people often referred to the neighborhood as Mayberry, according to Springston, 63. In 1948, her parents bought the house where she lives with her husband and son. It dates to 1890, Springston said.<\/p><p>In the neighborhood, 49 properties sold in the past year, according to Billy Buck, an associate broker at Buck & Associates. The lowest priced was a one-bedroom, one-bath condominium for $200,000; the highest priced was a five-bedroom, five-bath farmhouse at $1.63 million. Twelve properties are on the market now, ranging from a one-bedroom, two-bath condo for $274,900 to a new five-bedroom, five-bath Craftsman house at $1.799 million.<\/p><p>Welcome wagon: The five-points intersection \u2014 Lee Highway, Old Dominion Drive, Quincy Street, Military Road and Quebec Street \u2014 is dotted with at least two car dealerships and other commercial establishments while nearby is a Safeway and the Cherrydale Hardware, which opened in 1938.<\/p><p>The Cherrydale Volunteer Fire House, built in 1919, is home to such events as the annual spaghetti dinner, concerts and for 90 years each December there is a visit from Santa Claus for children under 12. Other community events are the annual Fourth of July party and picnic at 21st and Stafford streets. A neighborhood with its own \"welcome wagon,\" Cherrydale has approximately 1,400 households and three parks as well as the Martha Custis Trail for biking, running and walking.<\/p><p>Schools: Glebe Elementary, Taylor Elementary, Swanson Middle, Kenmore Middle and Washington-Lee High.<\/p><p>Transit: The neighborhood is close to the Virginia Square or Ballston Metro stops on the Orange and Silver lines. Metro and Arlington Transit buses connect at Ballston and Virginia Square. Capital Bikeshare also is available.<\/p><p>Crime: From July 2014 through June 2015, according to Arlington County police, one robbery and two burglaries were reported in the area.<\/p><p>Harriet Edleson is a freelance writer.","171":"Now that Newt Gingrich has vaulted into the lead in the Republican presidential stakes, he's going to be seeing a lot more of this:<\/p><p>Calling it the \"dumbest thing\" he has done in recent years isn't enough.

There were two periods of warming, the first from about 1910 through 1945, and the second from the mid-1970s to the late-1990s. They were both roughly the same magnitude. Because the first one was long before we put the majority of fossil carbon into the atmosphere, Newt can say\u2014with scientific authority\u2014that the magnitude of 'natural' climate change is likely to be at least as large as what humans have done.<\/p><p>Then Newt should proceed to the future. It's not the heat, it's the sensitivity. How much it will warm in the future is a function of how sensitive the atmosphere is to doubling atmospheric carbon dioxide. There are a number of independent arguments now coming together showing that this value may have been overestimated. The reference for the most recent is a November issue of Science.<\/p><p>Next, a little refreshing honesty: in 2009, the House of Representatives passed a cap-and-trade bill (which the Senate did not) commanding that the average american\u201438 years from now\u2014be allowed the carbon dioxide emissions of the average citizen in 1867. Prior to its passage, Newt was undeniably for such a system. Newt could call that that the \"second dumbest thing\" he has done and be finished with it.<\/p><p>After setting the record straight, how about interjecting his own political philosophy? When asked what to do about global warming, he should give the honest answer: if the atmosphere indeed is not as sensitive to carbon dioxide changes as previously thought, the correct response is nothing.<\/p><p>That's because \"nothing\" really means something. Newt should channel his historian. When markets are free, capital supports innovation more efficiently than when they aren't. Think about the remarkable changes in energy and technology in the last 100 years. Isn't it rather obvious that the same will occur in the next century, if only we don't hinder capital development? Newt might even use the catchy saw (first sloganed by Northern Illinois Gas in 1972) the future belongs to the efficient, and that there are impressive market forces that advantage those who produce things efficiently or produce efficient things.<\/p><p>When the doomsayers say Newt is believing in a Deus ex machine to dramatically cut carbon dioxide emissions, he might point out that those were the same folks who, only a very few years ago, told us we were running out of natural gas.

Fuel Tech stumbled last summer when the U.S. District Court of Appeals vacated the Environmental Protection Agency's rule spelling out timetables for NOX reduction across the eastern half of the U.S. In a surprise move the same Court of Appeals reinstated the Clean Air Interstate Rule in December, and it went into effect on Jan. 1 as originally scheduled. Fuel Tech also sells chemicals that are tossed into a coal burner to fight slag and thereby boost power plant efficiency.

We're beginning to set the stage for the grand bargain.\"<\/p><p>Among the highlights of the president's plan is spending cuts and tax increases that would reduce the deficit by $1.8 trillion over 10 years, replacing the $1.2 trillion in automatic spending cuts, known as sequester, over the same period.<\/p><p>The proposal also is expected to include new spending for public works projects, early education and job training, as well as $580 billion in new taxes that Republicans oppose.<\/p><p>Counting reductions and higher taxes that Congress and Obama have approved since 2011, the 2014 budget would contribute $4.3 trillion to total deficit reduction by 2023.<\/p><p>On Saturday, the president said his budget was not his \"ideal plan,\" but it was a compromise that he would be willing to accept.<\/p><p>The House and Senate have already passed their own budget plans.

With Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, Connie Nielsen, Oliver Reed. Directed by Ridley Scott. At area theaters. Running time: 154 mins. Rated R: Gory violence, incest theme. 3 1\/2 Stars.<\/p><p>If there's a soft spot in your heart for the sword-&-sandal epic - and from the star rating above, I think you can guess where I stand - then you'll swoon with giddy delight over \"Gladiator,\" a sweaty, stylish hunkfest that takes you back to the days of \"Ben-Hur,\" \"Spartacus\" and the so recently departed Steve Reeves.<\/p><p>From his biceps to his gluteus, Maximus is maximus. This Roman general turned slave turned gladiator hasn't a shred of humor, but then, he doesn't have time for idle nonsense when he's lopping off heads all day. (The head-lopping is apparently his signature, like the mark of Zorro.)<\/p><p>In director Ridley Scott's thrilling, burnished epic, Maximus no sooner serves the empire by leveling Germania during a snowstorm than Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) tosses him a promotion he doesn't want - to succeed the aged emperor and whip Rome back into shape. All Maximus wants is to go home to his wife and child in the suburbs.<\/p><p>The careworn Russell Crowe is physically and temperamentally perfect for the part of Maximus. Still carrying some of the weight he packed on for \"The Insider,\" he's no gym-toned pretty boy. He's solid, beefy, rough-hewn, creaking along in his heavy leather costume, with a look on his puss of weary disdain.<\/p><p>What makes him sexy is his sense of honor and loyalty: \"What we do in life echoes in eternity!\" Anyway, it can't be his hygiene, although he is frequently bathed in a sanctifying golden glow.<\/p><p>After a coup by the emperor's weak-kneed son, Commodus (a whiny, surprisingly fleshy Joaquin Phoenix), Maximus' fortunes change. He winds up being thrown to the tigers, two shows daily, in Rome's Colosseum, the entertainment complex of its day.<\/p><p>Crowe, like his character, must grimly come to terms with the fact that, actor or gladiator, it's all about showmanship. Give the crowd what it wants, either at the multiplex or in the arena, and you can write your own ticket.<\/p><p>\"I have power only to amuse the mob,\" he spits contemptuously like a Shakespearean actor reduced to dinner theater.<\/p><p>The plot, about avenging honor, provides brief respite between an array of hand-to-hand battles that are pitched so furiously that individual components barely register; they're subliminal suggestions of computer-assisted carnage, with Jackson Pollock sprays of blood. For fans of the genre, yes, this is a good thing.<\/p><p>Connie Nielsen plays Commodus' sister and possible love interest for Maximus once his family is dispatched (politics, you know). Nielsen's costumes are laced up like bondage gear, and there is a tantalizing hint of romance past.<\/p><p>But the camera only has eyes for Crowe. The glowering! The seething! The hooded gaze! The quiet suffering! (Watch him carve away a tattoo he no longer has use for. No anesthetic! No disinfectant!)<\/p><p>The supporting cast makes for a gauntlet of worthy friends and adversaries, all of them thinkers, including Derek Jacobi (\"I, Claudius\") as a senator, Djimon Hounsou (\"Amistad\") as a fellow gladiator and Oliver Reed, who died with two days to go on the shoot, looking a little woozy as a gladiator entrepreneur.<\/p><p>Reed's character is the one most in touch with the movie's premise - that entertainment is the goal, and a worthy one at that.","180":"\"We don't want people coming back or visiting,\" Nugent said. The town is still in an \"imminent danger of fire,\" with several fires still burning nearby. \"I can see black smoke behind the courthouse,\" she said.<\/p><p>The fire in Presidio County has grown to 80,000 acres with only 10% containment, the Forest Service said early Monday.<\/p><p>That growth, according to fire operations chief Mark Sanford, came after the fire \"made a 12-mile run on Saturday.\" Officials still don't know what caused the fast-moving fire, he said.<\/p><p>Despite the damage, Nugent said things could be much worse. \"Tourism is huge\" in Fort Davis, she said, but none of the tourist structures have been burned. The downtown and the historic fort buildings are unscathed, she said.<\/p><p>The blaze, known as the Rock House fire, is currently the largest fire burning in the United States and is just one of 10 fires burning more than 312,000 acres in Texas.<\/p><p>Another 34 homes have burned in a fire in Midland County that has consumed over 16,500 acres and that the state agency on Sunday described as \"very active\" and not at all contained, officials said.<\/p><p>A Red Cross shelter has been set up at Midland College for those displaced or otherwise affected by this wildfire.<\/p><p>\"(Firefighters) can't outrun it,\" said Alan Craft, a spokesman for the state's Lone Star Incident Management Team.<\/p><p>Another large fire near Swenson has scorched some 103,000 acres in three counties, according to the state Forest Service. Spokeswoman April Saginor said officials believe the Swenson fire has been that large for a couple of days, but were not able to remap it until Monday.<\/p><p>As of Sunday night, the blaze across parts of Stonewall, Knox and King counties was totally uncontained despite the use of air resources, bulldozers, fire engines and other tools and personnel, a statement from the Forest Service said.<\/p><p>Official say this fire was caused by a man cutting a pipe.","181":"Some things are more important than football, and Leah Still is doing something that's much harder than anything that can be done on a football field.<\/p><p>Former Cincinnati Bengals defensive lineman Devon Still announced on Instagram that his daughter Leah is cancer-free.<\/p><p>Leah Still, 5, was diagnosed with cancer in June 2014 and given a 50-50 chance to live.<\/p><p>The Bengals kept Still on their practice squad after cutting him last year, according to SI.com, and he eventually made the active roster and appeared in 12 games.<\/p><p>Still again was cut in September and is currently a free agent, but he'll take Leah kicking cancer over signing with a team any day.<\/p><p>More from The Sports Daily:","182":"Most people, asked to identify the most universal shift in law enforcement over the past 15 years, would likely think of militarization, calls for community policing, or perhaps the slow decline of \"broken windows\".<\/p><p>But from the turn of the millennium to date, arguably no development has been more widespread in law enforcement than the adoption of so called \"less-lethal\" electric control devices (ECD), which many people know by the name of their most prolific manufacturer: Taser International. The company currently supplies their weapons to 17,800 of the United States' roughly 18,000 law enforcement agencies.<\/p><p>The brand name Taser has become as synonymous with these devices as Kleenex or Xerox have to photocopies and tissues \u2013 a quirk of language known as a \"proprietary eponym\". The word has even become a verb, as people commonly speak of being \"Tased\" or \"Tasered\".<\/p><p>The word Taser, though, didn't start with the company: it's actually a loose acronym of the book Tom Swift and His Electric Rifle. Jack Cover, the inventor of the modern ECD, named his prototype after the YA sci-fi novel he loved, and the very idea for a less-lethal electric gun was largely inspired by the fictional one described in the book.<\/p><p>And while this quirky history is known among some in law enforcement and engineering circles, the innocence with which it's told \u2013 a curious inventor culling inspiration from the literature of his youth \u2013 belies a more sinister truth: the book itself is boldly racist.<\/p><p>Tom Swift and His Electric Rifle, published in New York in 1911 under the pen name Victor Appleton, is typical of the literature of its time: an imperialist adventure tale set against the backdrop of a wild and dark African continent. In it, the protagonist, Tom Swift, develops an electric rifle \u2013 a totally novel idea in 1911 \u2013 and decides to test it in Africa in the hunt for ivory.<\/p><p>Africa, in the context of the book, exists only as a frontier of underexploited resources ripe for the wealth accumulation of white men daring enough to attempt. \"Elephant shooting in Africa! My! With my new electric rifle ... what a fellow couldn't do in the dark continent!\"<\/p><p>\"With the price of ivory soaring,\" says Swift's veteran hunting companion, \"there's a chance for us all to get a lot of money.\"<\/p><p>While this unabashed entrepreneurial imperialism tends to read as a relic of a bygone age, today disproportionately white police departments in places like Ferguson, Missouri, often function similarly as the adventurers sent to do the dangerous work of this kind of wealth generation. Like in the book, black communities are often seen not as dynamic places where people live lives, but as sites for plunder.<\/p><p>Take, for example, the Department of Justice's March report on the prevalence of predatory, revenue-based policing in St Louis County: entire municipalities there, as elsewhere in the US, float their operating budgets and justify their own existence on the racially biased extraction of statutory fees from primarily black residents. This scheme has only begun to decline because of the protests and organizing that defined Ferguson in the wake of Mike Brown's death.<\/p><p>In the book, as in America today, the black people are rendered as either passive, simple and childlike, or animalistic and capable of unimaginable violence. They are described in the book at various points as \"hideous in their savagery, wearing only the loin cloth, and with their kinky hair stuck full of sticks\", and as \"wild, savage and ferocious ... like little red apes\".<\/p><p>Swift and his travel companions quickly determine the blacks, scarcely human, need to be controlled, guided or killed as determined by the more \"civilized\" white outsiders.<\/p><p>Consider then how quickly the black people of Ferguson were rendered something less than fully human in the wake of Mike Brown's killing: an on-duty Ferguson police officer, a former NYPD commissioner and a popular actor all spared no time in invoking the discourse of \"animals\" in reference to black protesters. Near and far, incredulous commentators sought to cast the police as the sole defenders of black communities, and the only thing standing between those communities and self-destruction.<\/p><p>\"White police officers wouldn't be there if you weren't killing each other,\" former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani said on Meet the Press last November. Echoing Swift's rank paternalism, he later added: \"I probably saved more black lives as mayor of New York City than any mayor in the history of this city.\"<\/p><p>In the book, when Swift and his companions proudly use their advanced weapons \u2013 particularly the electric rifle \u2013 to dispatch with an incoming buffalo stampede, they too happily celebrate themselves as saviors.<\/p><p>\"Had it not been for the white men, the native village, which consisted of only frail huts, would have been completely wiped out by the animals,\" the novel reads.<\/p><p>Being named after a racist book doesn't make a company or device racist, any more than a person being named after a racist relative makes them so. A name is just that \u2013 and a Taser on its face is no more racist than the city or state of Washington are, simply for being named after our slaveholding first president.<\/p><p>But as recent campus activism in places such as Harvard and Princeton have demonstrated, there is real value in coming to terms with the bigotry embedded in the seemingly innocuous names and symbols of even our most ordinary, and aspirationally colorblind, institutions.<\/p><p>Being aware of the history of the word Taser should make us pause and consider that, every day, predominantly white police officers walk into predominantly black communities armed with weapons first imagined in a book in which \"civilized\" whites entered the black wilds for the purpose of plunder, only to cast themselves as the saviors of the natives. It isn't meaningless that today that sequence sometimes appears to persist in reverse.","183":"Despite the firestorm over his comments about rape and pregnancy, Representative Todd Akin says he has no plans to drop out as the Republican Senate nominee in Missouri.<\/p><p>But what if he did?<\/p><p>The procedures in Missouri to change nominees midstream are complicated and intended to discourage just the sort of change that many in the Republican Party say they are eager to see happen.<\/p><p>\"As more time passes, you're starting to go up against deadlines,\" said Stacie Temple, a spokeswoman for Missouri's secretary of state, Robin Carnahan, a Democrat. Ms. Temple said the longer Mr. Akin waited, the more difficult it would get.<\/p><p>The first deadline for Mr. Akin to have easily withdrawn from the race was Tuesday evening. His decision to stay in the race means that he now has only a few weeks to reconsider before things get even harder.<\/p><p>Certification of the presidential ballots in Missouri will be no later than Sept. 17, and could be shortly after President Obama officially accepts the Democratic nomination on Sept. 5.<\/p><p>Once the ballots are printed, any candidate who seeks to withdraw must pay for the reprinting of new ballots. That could be prohibitively expensive for Mr. Akin, but presumably the Republican Party \u2014 which badly wants him to withdraw \u2014 would cover the cost.<\/p><p>Military overseas ballots begin shipping out Sept. 22. That might be the first firm deadline. But the drop-dead deadline is Sept. 25, when general absentee ballots are sent out.<\/p><p>Mel Carnahan, the former Missouri governor and Ms. Carnahan's father, died on Oct. 16, 2000, during his campaign for the Senate against the Republican incumbent, John Ashcroft. Mr. Carnahan's name nonetheless appeared on the ballot in November \u2014 and he won. (His widow, Jean, was appointed to the seat, and lost it in special election in 2002.)<\/p><p>Assuming that Mr. Akin bows to pressure from Republican leaders (or simply concludes that he isn't able to raise enough money to mount a credible campaign), Missouri law requires that he seek a court order allowing him to drop out of the race.<\/p><p>State officials say that issuing such court orders is routine. Mr. Akin would merely have to file the necessary papers with the court and his name would no longer be printed on the November ballot. Republicans could then quickly nominate someone else to run against Senator Claire McCaskill, the Democratic incumbent.<\/p><p>Democrats would no doubt like to see Mr. Akin \u2014 now politically weakened by his comments on rape and pregnancy \u2014 stay in the race. In theory, the Democratic officials who run the state's election offices could object to Mr. Akin's request for a court order, a move that would force a hearing before a judge.<\/p><p>The relevant statute says someone like Mr. Akin can withdraw \"pursuant to a court order, which, except for good cause shown by the election authority in opposition thereto, shall be freely given upon application by the candidate to the circuit court in the county of such candidate's residence.\"<\/p><p>Election officials say they can find no precedent at all for such an objection in the state's history. But Ms. Carnahan is herself a factor in Republican minds. As the Democratic Senate nominee in 2010, she lost to Representative Roy Blunt, and Republicans imagine she could put up a fight.<\/p><p>\"The secretary's job is to protect the rights of Missouri voters,\" Ms. Temple said when asked whether Ms. Carnahan would fight a court order to remove Mr. Akin's name from the ballot.<\/p><p>A further complication: Under state law, any election authority in Missouri can oppose a withdrawal order, down to the county and city level, and there are Democrats aplenty in Missouri. But Ms. Temple added that right now, it would be up to a Missouri court to determine whether Mr. Akin could withdraw, not the secretary of state.<\/p><p>\"It's completely in the hands of the court to decide the facts,\" she said.<\/p><p>Assuming Mr. Akin does manage to drop out, the state central committee of the Republican Party in Missouri would have to pick a new candidate within 28 days, or by Oct. 12, whichever comes first.","184":"Jim Herron Zamora, Chronicle Staff Writer<\/p><p>Larry and Muriel fight back tears as they leave the courthouse after hearing that their son Darren Ray was found the guilty of killing Terrance Kelly, Wednesday Oct. 11, 2006, in Martinez, Ca.

He said that the defendant feared for his life in an unrelated dispute and accidentally shot Kelly as the football player was waiting in a car to give his stepbrother, Brandon Young, a ride home from his girlfriend's house in Richmond's Iron Triangle District.<\/p><p>Laba argued that Pratcher should be convicted of manslaughter because the death was \"a tragic mistake.\"<\/p><p>But prosecutor David Brown told jurors Kelly's death amounted to \"cold-blooded murder,\" because Pratcher was determined to kill someone that night.

It's totally unfair -- my son is not guilty of first degree murder.\"<\/p><p>Pratcher was 15 years old when Kelly was killed and was tried as an adult in Contra Costa County Superior Court.

Fewer voters than expected turned out.<\/p><p>Editor's note: John Avlon is a CNN contributor and senior political columnist for Newsweek and The Daily Beast. He is co-editor of the book \"Deadline Artists: America's Greatest Newspaper Columns.\"<\/p><p>(CNN) -- Beneath Rick Santorum's stunning three-state sweep on Tuesday stands another stubborn sign of dissatisfaction with the status quo: Republican turnout is down.<\/p><p>I'm talking embarrassingly, disturbingly, hey-don't-you-know-it's-an-election-year bad. It is a sign of a serious enthusiasm gap among the rank and file, and a particularly bad omen for Mitt Romney and the GOP in the general election.<\/p><p>Here's the tale of the tape, state by state, beginning with Tuesday night: Minnesota had just more than 47,000 people turn out for its caucuses this year -- four years ago it was nearly 63,000 -- and Romney came in first, not a distant third as he did Tuesday night. In Colorado, more than 70,000 people turned out for its caucus in 2008 -- but in 2012 it was 65,000. And Missouri -- even making a generous discount for the fact that this was an entirely symbolic contest -- had 232,000 people turn out, less than half the number who did four years ago.<\/p><p>Even with months of pre-primary hype and attention solely devoted to the Republican field, turnout in this election cycle essentially flat-lined. In Iowa, a little more than 121,000 people voted, compared with nearly 119,000 four years before, when action in the Democratic caucuses absorbed most of the attention.<\/p><p>In New Hampshire, the same dynamic applied -- 245,000 voters turned out in 2012, compared with 241,000 four years before, despite Republicans being the only game in town and independents making up 47% of the total turnout in 2012, according to CNN exit polls. Take out the independent voters and you've got a deep net decline.<\/p><p>Always proudly rebellious, South Carolina has been the great outlier in this election cycle. With Newt Gingrich making an all-out push for conservatives in a conservative state, turnout was up almost 150,000 over four years before.<\/p><p>But in Florida, the decline became unmistakable. Maybe it decreased because the Romney and Gingrich campaigns, plus super PACS, spent more than $18 million in the Sunshine State on TV ads, of which 93% were negative in the last week alone, according to the Campaign Media Analysis Group. After all, negative ads depress turnout. But after all the mud was thrown, 1.6 million people turned out in the nation's fourth largest state, which might sound impressive until you compare it with the nearly 2 million who turned out in 2008.<\/p><p>Nevada was even worse, with 32,894 people turning out to vote in a state with more than 465,000 registered Republicans. Four years before, more than 44,300 participated in the caucus. Turnout was down more than 25% despite the GOP caucuses being the only game in town. Party officials were expecting a turnout of more than 70,000.<\/p><p>All this should be a wake-up call for the GOP. Despite an enormous amount of national media attention devoted to each of the states to date, the response has been a notable yawn among the Republican rank and file.<\/p><p>The turnout numbers are even worse when you compare them with the number of registered Republicans in each state that has voted to date.<\/p><p>The caucuses in particular bring out an unrepresentative sample of a state's Republican Party. For all the grass-roots romanticism, there has got to be a better way to pick a presidential nominee.<\/p><p>But the news is worst for Romney, long the presumptive front-runner in a party that tends to reward the man next in line.<\/p><p>\"Reluctantly Romney\" could be a bumper sticker, even for his supporters. The former Massachusetts governor has found it difficult to climb above 35% in national polls, meaning that a majority of Republicans still support someone else in a notably weak field. His vote margins and totals lag behind those of four years before, when he lost the nomination to John McCain in a crowded and comparatively competent field, although Minnesota is the first state he won in '08 and lost in 2012.<\/p><p>You reap what you sow, and part of the reason turnout is down is directly related to the problem of polarization. The Republican Party is more ideologically polarized than at any time in recent history. Therefore, it put up more purely right-wing candidates than it did four years before, when center-right leaders such as McCain and Rudy Giuliani were also in the race. A bigger tent inspired bigger turnout.<\/p><p>But the other reason is simple dissatisfaction with the candidates.<\/p><p>Republicans seem united in their anger against the president -- like the Democrats in 2004 -- but they are uninspired by their options. Draft movements for fantasy candidates ranging from Chris Christie to Mitch Daniels to Paul Ryan and even Jeb Bush have started and failed.

Fewer voters than expected turned out.<\/p><p>Editor's note: John Avlon is a CNN contributor and senior political columnist for Newsweek and The Daily Beast. He is co-editor of the book \"Deadline Artists: America's Greatest Newspaper Columns.\"<\/p><p>(CNN) -- Beneath Rick Santorum's stunning three-state sweep on Tuesday stands another stubborn sign of dissatisfaction with the status quo: Republican turnout is down.<\/p><p>I'm talking embarrassingly, disturbingly, hey-don't-you-know-it's-an-election-year bad. It is a sign of a serious enthusiasm gap among the rank and file, and a particularly bad omen for Mitt Romney and the GOP in the general election.<\/p><p>Here's the tale of the tape, state by state, beginning with Tuesday night: Minnesota had just more than 47,000 people turn out for its caucuses this year -- four years ago it was nearly 63,000 -- and Romney came in first, not a distant third as he did Tuesday night. In Colorado, more than 70,000 people turned out for its caucus in 2008 -- but in 2012 it was 65,000. And Missouri -- even making a generous discount for the fact that this was an entirely symbolic contest -- had 232,000 people turn out, less than half the number who did four years ago.<\/p><p>Even with months of pre-primary hype and attention solely devoted to the Republican field, turnout in this election cycle essentially flat-lined. In Iowa, a little more than 121,000 people voted, compared with nearly 119,000 four years before, when action in the Democratic caucuses absorbed most of the attention.<\/p><p>In New Hampshire, the same dynamic applied -- 245,000 voters turned out in 2012, compared with 241,000 four years before, despite Republicans being the only game in town and independents making up 47% of the total turnout in 2012, according to CNN exit polls. Take out the independent voters and you've got a deep net decline.<\/p><p>Always proudly rebellious, South Carolina has been the great outlier in this election cycle. With Newt Gingrich making an all-out push for conservatives in a conservative state, turnout was up almost 150,000 over four years before.<\/p><p>But in Florida, the decline became unmistakable. Maybe it decreased because the Romney and Gingrich campaigns, plus super PACS, spent more than $18 million in the Sunshine State on TV ads, of which 93% were negative in the last week alone, according to the Campaign Media Analysis Group. After all, negative ads depress turnout. But after all the mud was thrown, 1.6 million people turned out in the nation's fourth largest state, which might sound impressive until you compare it with the nearly 2 million who turned out in 2008.<\/p><p>Nevada was even worse, with 32,894 people turning out to vote in a state with more than 465,000 registered Republicans. Four years before, more than 44,300 participated in the caucus. Turnout was down more than 25% despite the GOP caucuses being the only game in town. Party officials were expecting a turnout of more than 70,000.<\/p><p>All this should be a wake-up call for the GOP. Despite an enormous amount of national media attention devoted to each of the states to date, the response has been a notable yawn among the Republican rank and file.<\/p><p>The turnout numbers are even worse when you compare them with the number of registered Republicans in each state that has voted to date.<\/p><p>The caucuses in particular bring out an unrepresentative sample of a state's Republican Party. For all the grass-roots romanticism, there has got to be a better way to pick a presidential nominee.<\/p><p>But the news is worst for Romney, long the presumptive front-runner in a party that tends to reward the man next in line.<\/p><p>\"Reluctantly Romney\" could be a bumper sticker, even for his supporters. The former Massachusetts governor has found it difficult to climb above 35% in national polls, meaning that a majority of Republicans still support someone else in a notably weak field. His vote margins and totals lag behind those of four years before, when he lost the nomination to John McCain in a crowded and comparatively competent field, although Minnesota is the first state he won in '08 and lost in 2012.<\/p><p>You reap what you sow, and part of the reason turnout is down is directly related to the problem of polarization. The Republican Party is more ideologically polarized than at any time in recent history. Therefore, it put up more purely right-wing candidates than it did four years before, when center-right leaders such as McCain and Rudy Giuliani were also in the race. A bigger tent inspired bigger turnout.<\/p><p>But the other reason is simple dissatisfaction with the candidates.<\/p><p>Republicans seem united in their anger against the president -- like the Democrats in 2004 -- but they are uninspired by their options. Draft movements for fantasy candidates ranging from Chris Christie to Mitch Daniels to Paul Ryan and even Jeb Bush have started and failed. Some party leaders show more enthusiasm for a hypothetical 2016 crop of candidates, including Marco Rubio and Bobby Jindal, than they do for the flawed choices before them in this election. Divided and dispirited is an odd place for the Republican Party to be so soon after the enthusiasms of the 2010 tea party-driven election.<\/p><p>The bottom line is that voter turnout matters.

This is not going away.<\/p><p>But, Newt can turn his pas-de-deux on the loveseat with Nancy into an opportunity to promote a consistent and electable political message.<\/p><p>Because he will be asked about this at every turn, Newt will have the air time and the opportunity to tell the truth on climate change\u2014based upon real science\u2014and to interface it with a limited-government philosophy. The two are easy to do.<\/p><p>Start with the obvious. Instead of waffling on the subject, he could just point out that earth's surface temperature is about 1\u00b0C warmer than it was a century ago. There were two periods of warming, the first from about 1910 through 1945, and the second from the mid-1970s to the late-1990s. They were both roughly the same magnitude. Because the first one was long before we put the majority of fossil carbon into the atmosphere, Newt can say\u2014with scientific authority\u2014that the magnitude of 'natural' climate change is likely to be at least as large as what humans have done.<\/p><p>Then Newt should proceed to the future. It's not the heat, it's the sensitivity. How much it will warm in the future is a function of how sensitive the atmosphere is to doubling atmospheric carbon dioxide. There are a number of independent arguments now coming together showing that this value may have been overestimated. The reference for the most recent is a November issue of Science.<\/p><p>Next, a little refreshing honesty: in 2009, the House of Representatives passed a cap-and-trade bill (which the Senate did not) commanding that the average american\u201438 years from now\u2014be allowed the carbon dioxide emissions of the average citizen in 1867. Prior to its passage, Newt was undeniably for such a system. Newt could call that that the \"second dumbest thing\" he has done and be finished with it.<\/p><p>After setting the record straight, how about interjecting his own political philosophy? When asked what to do about global warming, he should give the honest answer: if the atmosphere indeed is not as sensitive to carbon dioxide changes as previously thought, the correct response is nothing.<\/p><p>That's because \"nothing\" really means something. Newt should channel his historian. When markets are free, capital supports innovation more efficiently than when they aren't. Think about the remarkable changes in energy and technology in the last 100 years. Isn't it rather obvious that the same will occur in the next century, if only we don't hinder capital development? Newt might even use the catchy saw (first sloganed by Northern Illinois Gas in 1972) the future belongs to the efficient, and that there are impressive market forces that advantage those who produce things efficiently or produce efficient things.<\/p><p>When the doomsayers say Newt is believing in a Deus ex machine to dramatically cut carbon dioxide emissions, he might point out that those were the same folks who, only a very few years ago, told us we were running out of natural gas. Innovation and capital revolutionized drilling and fracturing shale, and we now know we have literally hundreds of years of it under our feet. There are a lot more voters and delegates around the country who will benefit from the shale revolution than there are in ethanol-addicted Iowa.","190":"By DEXTER FORDMAY 9, 2014<\/p><p>MALIBU, CALIF. \u2014 Good luck, America, with your efforts to pigeonhole the BMW i8.<\/p><p>The car is a post-petroleum brand statement. It's a sci-fi showpiece. It's an ultralight carbon-fiber production car. It's a triumph of parts-bin engineering. It's a take-no-prisoners canyon racer. It's a winged chariot of the Malibu \u00fcber-chic. It's a $136,625 (destination included!) commuter car for Silicon Valley moguls.<\/p><p>The hardware, at least, is straightforward. The central passenger shell is a stiff, lightweight carbon-fiber structure. It is bolted to an aluminum skeleton that holds the 7.1-kilowatt-hour lithium-ion battery pack in its spine.<\/p><p>An electric drive section similar to the one in the BMW i3 people pod is bolted to the front, its 131 horsepower electric motor and 2-speed automatic transmission driving the front wheels. The rear power package is sourced from the new Mini; its 3-cylinder, twin-turbocharged 231-horsepower engine drives the rear wheels through a 6-speed automatic transmission.<\/p><p>The multilayered skin is molded thermoplastic that weighs half as much as steel. Other extreme weight-saving measures, including aluminum wiring and chemically hardened ultrathin glass, keep the weight to 3,267 pounds. The long, light doors swing up and forward. From the front, with doors open, the i8 looks as if it's signaling a touchdown.<\/p><p>The interior is compact yet comfortable, though those over 6-foot-2 may need more legroom, and the rear seats are designed for tiny, limber people.<\/p><p>Getting in is a challenge. The sill is wide, the seat is low, and there's a trick: sit sideways, slide butt in, retract legs. Getting out? Imagine climbing from a bathtub without using your hands.<\/p><p>Pick a personality with the driving-mode buttons. \"Comfort\" keeps the car in electric mode to 37 m.p.h., or until you mash the right-side pedal. The eDrive button keeps things electric to 75 m.p.h. or until the battery fades.<\/p><p>Travel range is about 20 miles in E.V. mode, and recharging takes 1.5 hours at 240 volts or four hours at 120. The Eco-Pro button increases electric efficiency 20 percent by softening the motor response and optimizing climate-control settings. I observed gasoline-powered mileage figures from 27 m.p.g. (impatient cornering) to 37 m.p.g. (safe-and-sane commuting).<\/p><p>In the city, the i8 feels silent, solid and intuitive \u2014 the excitement happens outside, as gawkers track its progress.<\/p><p>On Los Angeles's well-used freeways, the Comfort setting leaves some comfort to be desired. Even with the variable dampers at full soft, the i8 bobs its nose like Muhammad Ali in the first rounds. High-performance tires come standard in the United States; European versions get narrower wheels and taller tires for lower drag and a smoother ride.<\/p><p>In Sport mode, the suspension and steering stiffen and the gas engine roars, pops on upshifts and matches revs downshifting into corners. It sounds great, and it should: much of what you hear is a prerecorded soundtrack piped through the sound system.<\/p><p>The i8 feels strong at full power, but the head-snapping response expected from a partly electric powertrain is absent. The i8 takes time to gather itself, with an atavistic vestige of turbo lag.<\/p><p>On the intestinal twists of Mulholland Highway the i8 can be driven with brutal abandon. The brakes are strong, the chassis is as stiff as a bank vault, and there's enough power to reach the next corner presently. BMW claims a 0-to-60 time of 4.2 seconds, and top speed is 155 m.p.h.<\/p><p>The front tires push when going hard into corners, but everything sticks coming out. Even with the stability control off, the i8 resists spinning its tires \u2014 the software ghost is still there, lurking in the machine.<\/p><p>The i8 is complicated and imperfect. A car that will be used for emissions-free commuting should allow people to get in and get out. It rides harshly. The exterior design is too clever \u2014 the layered rear deck whispers \"Your trunk is open.\"<\/p><p>Still, if the i8 represents the future of sports cars, things are looking bright.<\/p><p>A version of this review appears in print on May 11, 2014, on page AU4 of the New York edition with the headline: The Future Will See You Now.

Small businesses and families starving for credit will eventually get relief as the funding props up banks and they increase lending, but Rajoy didn't offer guidance on when.<\/p><p>Spain on Saturday became the fourth \u2014 and largest \u2014 of the 17 countries that use Europe's common currency to request a bailout \u2014 a big blow to a nation that a few years ago took pride as the continent's economic superstar only to see it become the hot spot in the eurozone debt crisis. Its economy is the eurozone's fourth largest after Germany, France and Italy.<\/p><p>Across the country, Spaniards reacted with a mixture of anger and relief to the news. The amount of the rescue fund, if all is tapped, amounts to \u20ac21,000 of new debt for each person in the nation of 47 million where the average annual salary for those with work is about the same amount and the unemployment rate for those under age 25 is 52 percent.<\/p><p>The country is already reeling from deep austerity cuts Rajoy has imposed over the last six months that have raised taxes, made it easier to hire and fire workers, and cut deep into cherished government programs including education and national health care.<\/p><p>\"It's obviously a shame,\" said civil servant Luisa Saraguren, 44, as she strolled on a sunny Sunday morning with her young daughter. \"But this bailout was fully predictable, and the consequences of this help are going to be a lot bigger compared to the cuts we've been living with already.\"<\/p><p>Rajoy took pains to avoid the word bailout Sunday, saying Spain's rescue package is a line of credit that its most troubled banks will be able to tap. The assistance will not come with the outside control over government macroeconomic policy like that imposed Greece, Ireland and Portugal when their public finances were bailed out.<\/p><p>He said interest rates on the loans will be considerably lower than the rate near 7 percent that Spain has been forced to pay recently on the international debt markets, a level that forced the other countries to seek bailouts.<\/p><p>Spain will regain the economic credibility it has lost by shoring up its banks, which will result in credit being restored so businesses and individuals shut off from loans can start borrowing and the economy will grow again, Rajoy insisted, again without saying when.<\/p><p>Europe's widening recession and financial crisis has hurt companies and investors around the world. Providing a financial lifeline to Spanish banks is likely to relieve anxiety on the Spanish economy \u2014 which is five times larger than Greece's \u2014 and on markets concerned about the country's ability to pay its way.<\/p><p>Spain's financial problems are not due to Greek-style government over-spending. The country's banks particularly its savings banks or \"cajas,\" got caught up in the collapse of a real estate bubble in 2008 that got worse over the past four years. However, as Spain's leaders have struggled for a solution to their banking crisis, the country's borrowing costs have soared close to the level that forced the governments of Greece, Portugal and Ireland to seek rescues.<\/p><p>Some of Spain's banks are struggling with by toxic real estate loans and assets amid fears the problem will get worse as more jobless people can't pay their mortgages. The Bank of Spain says the toxic loans and assets total around \u20ac180 billion. Nationalized lender Bankia SA, which has requested \u20ac19 billion in aid, has \u20ac32 billion in toxic assets. Around four other banks serving the domestic market are considered prime candidates for bailouts.<\/p><p>\"I could never get my mind round the scale of consumption in Spain over the past 20 years, having known it in the 1960s when it was still extremely poor,\" said Paul Preston, a history professor and expert on Spain with the London School of Economics. \"Lots of people enjoyed the consumer boom, but not everybody. Now everybody's having to pay for it.\"<\/p><p>Rajoy blamed Spain's woes on the previous Socialist administration of Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero without mentioning him or his government by name. Zapatero was ousted by Rajoy in a landslide last November by voters outraged over the Socialist handling of the economy.<\/p><p>\"Last year Spain's public administration spent \u20ac90 billion more than it took in, this can't be maintained, we can't live like that,\" Rajoy said.<\/p><p>But Socialist Party leader Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba said Rajoy should acknowledge that Spain is now in bailout territory.<\/p><p>\"The government is trying to make us believe that we've won the lottery, that the Three Kings of Orient have arrived, and that isn't so,\" Rubalcaba said.<\/p><p>After his press conference, Rajoy defended his decision to jet off an hour later to Poland to see Spain's famed national football team take on Italy in the Euro 2012 competition. He said he would be on the ground in Gdansk only for the game before flying back to Madrid Sunday night.<\/p><p>\"I'll be there two and a half hours and then I'll leave,\" Rajoy said. \"I think the national team deserves it.\"","195":"12\/28\/2015 AT 04:50 PM EST<\/p><p>Like a lot of professional funny people, Beth Stelling is used to getting candid about her life offstage. Recently, the Los Angeles based-comedian started working one very personal, serious experience into her routine.<\/p><p>on Monday to open up about a violent relationship with an ex boyfriend, sharing photos of her bruised arms and legs and explaining why she has decided to include discussions of the abuse in her stand-up.<\/p><p>\"Same girl in all of these photos (me). I've had an amazing year, and you've seen the highlights here, so these photos are an uncommon thing to share but not an uncommon issue,\" Stelling captions a collage of photos of her bruises and her onstage smile.<\/p><p>The comic, who released her album<\/p><p>this fall and has a Comedy Central special, was hesitant to openly talk about the abuse, especially within her professional world.<\/p><p>\"There are many reasons not to make an abusive relationship public, mostly fear. Scared of what people will think, scared it makes me look weak or unprofessional,\" she writes.<\/p><p>\"When friends or comics ask why we broke up, it's not easy or comfortable to reply; it doesn't seem like the appropriate thing to say at a stand-up show, a party or a wedding. It's embarrassing. I feel stupid. After being verbally, physically abused and raped, I dated him for two more months. It's not simple.\"<\/p><p>Ultimately, Stelling couldn't exclude such a significant piece of her story from her onstage persona, even if it meant risking ridicule from the close-knit comedy community.<\/p><p>\"After I broke up with him, he said, 'You're very open and honest in your stand-up, and I just ask that you consider me when you talk about your ex because everyone knows who you're talking about.' And I abided. I wrote vague jokes because we both live in L.A., and I didn't want to hurt him, start a war, press charges, be interrogated or harassed by him or his friends and family. I wanted to move on and forget because I didn't understand,\" Stelling shares.<\/p><p>\"I don't want revenge or to hurt him now, but it's unhealthy to keep this inside because my stand-up is pulled directly from my life. It's how I make my living. My personal is my professional. That is how I've always been; I make dark, funny. So now I'm allowing this to be part of my story.\"<\/p><p>Stelling says she's already started joking about the relationship and asked her followers to \"have the courage to listen and accept.\"<\/p><p>So far, the funny lady has been getting a positive response to her openness at the mic.<\/p><p>\"Already since talking about this onstage, many women have come to me after shows asking me to keep doing it,\" she says on Instagram. \"Men have shown their solidarity.\"","196":"Kenneth Ng calls his website a primer for tourists headed to<\/p><p>, but Fodor's it ain't.<\/p><p>The California State University at Northridge professor's site is a one-stop shop for men drawn to the country's sex tourism industry. Dotted with pictures of scantily clad women, the website, BigBabyKenny, advises would-be Johns on the art of negotiating with prostitutes. \"Start with a compliment,\" Ng advises.<\/p><p>Needless to say, Ng's website is causing headaches for Northridge administrators. First publicized by the Los Angeles Daily News, the economics professor's site has drawn a wave of unwelcome attention, forcing administrators to at once criticize its content and defend Ng's right to publish freely on his own time without university resources.<\/p><p>\"Until we find representative evidence that it infringes upon the work he does at the university itself, there's not much we can do about it,\" said Harold Hellenbrand, Northridge's provost.<\/p><p>There may be subtlety in Hellenbrand's words, but his message is clear: If BigBabyKenny infringes on Ng's ability to effectively do his job, then Northridge's position will change. Ng has already said his site is run through a separate server not connected to the university, but Northridge officials might still make a case that the site has interfered with his job. Asked if students complaining that they were no longer comfortable in Ng's class would compel Northridge to demand the site be taken down, Hellenbrand said \"I'm not inviting complaints, but you just hit on the key issue.\"<\/p><p>\"If [running the site is] what he wants to do, and at the same time he wants to educate students and students flock away, then that would create a problem,\" Hellenbrand said.<\/p><p>How Ng came to be identified as the author of BigBabyKenny is a story in itself. A frequent tourist of Thailand, Ng took to blogging on the website of a Bangkok bar called Big Mango Bar. In one controversial post, Ng advised men to seek women near a particular Buddhist shrine.<\/p><p>\"The naysayers will say its creepy to be hanging around the Muariti Shrine, hitting on the emotionally vulnerable girls desperately praying and paying Buddha for a better love life but I beg to differ. Buddha works in mysterious ways,\" he wrote.<\/p><p>Perturbed by the post, the bar owners removed it. That led Ng to start his own site, prompting what Ng describes as a concerted effort by the owners to publicize his penchant for writing about prostitutes. They sent mass e-mails to faculty listed in Northridge's directory, and also posted on RateMyProfessor.com, warning students about Ng, he said.<\/p><p>Ng readily defends the content of his site and says he has no intention of taking it down.<\/p><p>\"The university has no stake in this one way or the other, and besides, professors can say whatever they want,\" said Ng, a tenured associate professor of economics.<\/p><p>Some question whether Ng has crossed a gray legal line, however, by advising men on sex tourism. Patrick Trueman, a former U.S. justice department official, notes that there are several federal statutes that could come into play. Within U.S. Code 18 are two sections \u2013 2422 (a) and 2422 (b) \u2013 that specifically prohibit anyone from \"enticing or coercing a person\" to travel internationally in pursuit of prostitutes. Moreover, one section specifically prohibits the use of the Internet to lure people.<\/p><p>While prostitution may be tolerated in Thailand, that's immaterial under the federal code, Trueman said.<\/p><p>\"Inducing and enticing? Isn't that what this guy's doing?\" said Trueman, former chief of the Justice Department's Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section in the Criminal Division.<\/p><p>Trueman, now a lawyer specializing in sex trafficking and child abuse cases, said there would likely be debate about whether talking about procuring prostitutes online and actually arranging prostitutes for a person should be treated differently under the law.<\/p><p>\"Given how lax the fed government is on these crimes, they may not charge somebody unless they are more directly involved,\" he said. \"That's not to say this person couldn't be charged, and as I read it they could be charged.\"<\/p><p>Beyond the legal implications, critics have already attacked Ng on moral grounds. John Foubert, an Oklahoma State University professor who researches sex trafficking, argues that women \u2013 often minors \u2013 are forced into the sex tourism industry and often have trouble escaping it. Even if Ng is operating within the bounds of the law, Northridge officials have an ethical problem they've yet to face, Foubert said.<\/p><p>\"Do they want to live with the blood on their hands of these girls that are being essentially raped by these men, who are going down and purchasing sex? I think that's a larger question,\" said Foubert, an associate professor of college student development.<\/p><p>Ng said he allows anything to be written on his site, so long as it doesn't involve pedophilia or underage sex. He does, however, write about how difficult it is to effectively negotiate with a \"half or sometimes fully naked teenage girl\" when she's \"expertly gyrating\" on a man's lap.<\/p><p>While his critics have been speaking out since fall, Ng said he has yet to hear from a student who expressed discomfort about his website.<\/p><p>\"The job of the university is to expose students to the world \u2013 not just a politically correct view of the world and not just the good parts of the world,\" he said. \"If a student reads that [site], I personally think it's good for them. They learn about something out there; maybe they disapprove of it and they don't think it's good.\"<\/p><p>You share in the USA TODAY community, so please keep your comments smart and civil.

Tight end Vernon Davis? He has eight targets in the past three games.<\/p><p>It's hard to argue with Kaepernick's pecking order, given the results.<\/p><p>In a 41-34 win over the Patriots on Sunday, Crabtree (7 catches, 107 yards, 2 TDs) was featured on the 49ers' first possession - a tone-setting 63-yard touchdown march - with drive-opening catches of 11 and 13 yards. Kaepernick also threw his final pass to Crabtree, a 38-yard game-winner on a play that wasn't designed for San Francisco's No. 1 wide receiver.<\/p><p>In his past three games, Crabtree has 23 catches for 301 yards and two touchdowns with 90-plus receiving yards in each game. Prior to his streak, he had 90-plus receiving yards in five of the first 53 games of his four-year career.<\/p><p>In his five starts, Kaepernick has a 113.6 rating when targeting Crabtree, who has helped earn his confidence with reliable hands. According to Pro Football Focus, Crabtree has three drops in Kaepernick's starts, an impressive figure given the heat the Howitzer-armed quarterback puts on his throws.<\/p><p>On KNBR Tuesday, Harbaugh, who famously declared in the offseason Crabtree had the best hands he'd ever seen, crowed a bit when asked if there was a special Kaepernick-Crabtree chemistry.<\/p><p>\"Yeah, I think there is,\" Harbaugh said. \"But Michael has been doing this all year now. Talked about it every week, the ability to catch, nobody catches the ball better than Michael Crabtree. I think back to last summer when we were talking about the same topic. It might have even been on this show. A lot of people 'What? The greatest hands you've ever seen?' Nobody mentions that any more. Boy, the evidence sure is there.\"<\/p><p>With at least 10 catches and 132 yards over the final two regular-season games, Crabtree (73 catches, 868 yards) would become the 49ers' first 1,000-yard receiver since Terrell Owens in 2003 and will have the most receptions since Owens hauled in 100 in 2002.<\/p><p>Davis, who had team-highs in targets (eight), receptions (six) and yards (83) in Kaepernick's first start against Chicago last month, has since become an afterthought. He had one catch for 10 yards against the Patriots, and four catches, 29 yards and nine targets over the last four games.<\/p><p>Davis said he's yet to establish a chemistry with Kaepernick that matches the connection he had with former starter Alex Smith.<\/p><p>\"You have to develop that chemistry, that bond so you can be on the same page,\" Davis said. \"That's something me and Kaep don't have right now. We don't have it. You have to expect it because he just stepped in. Me and Alex, we've been here.\"<\/p><p>Asked why Crabtree has been quick to get on the same page, Davis said the red-hot wide receiver has been running shorter routes. However, he also noted, as Kaepernick did Sunday night, that Crabtree has earned his targets by breaking free from coverage.<\/p><p>\"Crab is a pretty good route runner,\" Davis said. \"He's getting open and Kaep is finding him.\"<\/p><p>Eric Branch is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.

Fuel Tech also sells chemicals that are tossed into a coal burner to fight slag and thereby boost power plant efficiency.

Beginning with its shot of a Pontiac GTO pulling doughnuts in a high school parking lot to Aerosmith's \"Sweet Emotion,\" \"Dazed\" is such a humane approximation of what it was like to come of age in the mid-1970s that one wishes it would never end. On the evidence of \"Boyhood\" and the \"Before Sunrise\" trilogy, though, Linklater doesn't want any of his movies to end. Thus \"Everybody Wants Some!!\"<\/p><p>Which at first is different, sometimes jarringly so, before wading into the open-armed embrace of experience that marks this filmmaker's finest work. The tipoffs are those double exclamation points and an onscreen title font that recalls a Skinemax late-night movie circa 1981. What if you took one of that era's hormone-drenched stu-coms and put real people in it?<\/p><p>The year is 1980, actually, and Jake (Blake Jenner from \"Glee\") is arriving for his freshman year at (the fictional) Southeastern Texas State University. A high school pitching star and rangy college prospect, he's assigned an off-campus baseball dorm with the other players. It's a ready-made animal house, with rules laid down by a briefly seen coach (Jonathan Breck) that are immediately ignored. Occasionally we'll get an onscreen reminder of how many dwindling days and hours remain before classes begin. These, too, are ignored.<\/p><p>Instead, Linklater parks his cameras to observe, with indulgence and much good humor, the bonding rituals of young men who only think they have it figured out. Jake's housemates fall into general categories that re-sort themselves into individual personalities: The motor-mouthed ladies' man Finnegan (Glen Powell), the Zen surfer-stoner Willoughby (Wyatt Russell), uber-competitive McReynolds (Tyler Hoechlin), country rube Billy (Will Brittain), smartass Nesbit (Austin Amelio), na\u00efve Brumley (Tanner Kalina). And so on.<\/p><p>A few stand slightly outside the pack: the over-confident psycho-nerd pitcher Jay Niles (Juston Street, freakily funny) and the laconic second base star Dale Douglas (J. Quinton Johnson), whose blackness is rarely commented on. Where are the women? There to be chased and partied with and seduced. \"This is college, Jake,\" the hero is told early on. \"The girls can be as big sluts as the guys.\"<\/p><p>Oh, dear. Is \"Everybody Wants Some!!\" what happens when you people an entire Richard Linklater movie with Matthew McConaughey's horndog Wooderson from \"Dazed and Confused\"? Yes and no, or, rather, yes, but only at first. As the boys sprawl through the last days of summer, the swagger that borders on smug begins to mellow and melt away. Searching for good times and girls, they hop from a disco one night to a country and western bar the next to a punk mosh pit to an art-student costume party, minds open, adapting, ever-changing. After a while, the hero starts having a smallish identity crisis, confessing that \"it sort of begs the question of who we are.\"<\/p><p>Well, yes. This is college, Jake. Even a high school sports star can be anyone he wants.<\/p><p>The movie eventually spins him off from the crowd into the arms of Beverly (Zoey Deutch), a tartly ardent stage arts freshman with Joni Mitchell posters on her wall. She's unpretentious for a theater brat, he's smart and soulful for a jock, and the two stand dazzled in the Venn diagram overlap of their attraction. These scenes try a little too hard to be charming but they are anyway, and if Deutch has the freckles and immediacy of a classic Brat Pack heroine, it may be because her mother is Lea Thompson of \"Back to the Future\" and \"Some Kind of Wonderful\" and her father is Howard Deutch, who directed the latter.<\/p><p>More second-generation pleasures: Wyatt Russell, who plays the woolly baseball mystic Willoughby, is the son of Kurt Russell and Goldie Hawn, and he has a high old time \u2014 emphasis on high \u2014 explaining to his teammates why \"Fearless,\" from the 1971 album \"Meddle,\" is the best track that Pink Floyd ever recorded. Because he is correct, I am awarding \"Everybody Wants Some!!\" an extra half-star.<\/p><p>Linklater was a high school baseball player who went to Sam Houston State on a scholarship, and the movie is steeped in the lazy, rivalrous minutiae of college ball. Willoughby gets off a moment of bliss when he muses on the pleasures of pitching \u2014 \"It's lovely out there on the bump,\" he says \u2014 and we learn that it's the .230 hitters who are always the most superstitious. Also that it's possible to slice a pitched baseball in half with an ax. At one point, one of the characters gazes with incredulity at a crowd of fellow students and says, \"I know what we're doing here. We're playing baseball. What are they doing here?\"<\/p><p>\"Everybody Wants Some!!\" is a nice long soak in the Proustian detritus of its era. Beverly drives a Gremlin, Jake knows the secret of winning at \"Space Invaders,\" and people can still confidently begin sentences with the words, \"It's like Carl Sagan says. . .\" What \"Sweet Emotion\" was to \"Dazed and Confused,\" so the Knack's \"My Sharona\" is to this movie, and the soundtrack rolls forward from there: glorious junk from the days when Eddie Rabbitt, Eddie Money, Sniff 'n' the Tears, and the BusBoys meant something.<\/p><p>All that's missing is a plot. But Linklater doesn't do plot; he does life. Says Powell's garrulous Finnegan, summing up the art of both this movie and this moviemaker, \"I don't think at all. I just talk a lot. It's jazz improv. You're invited.\" And so are we.<\/p><p>Written and directed by Richard Linklater. Starring Blake Jenner, Zoey Deutch, Glen Powell, Wyatt Russell, Tyler Hoechlin, Juston Street.

The president's push is part of a larger American effort to further isolate and increase pressure on Iran after accusing it of a plot to assassinate Saudi Arabia's ambassador to the United States.<\/p><p>If the United Nations' watchdog group agrees to publicize the evidence, including new data from recent months, it would almost certainly revive a debate that has been dormant during the Arab Spring about how aggressively the United States and its allies, including Israel, should move to halt Iran's suspected weapons program.<\/p><p>Over the longer term, several senior Obama administration officials said in interviews, they are mulling a ban on financial transactions with Iran's central bank \u2014 a move that has been opposed by China and other Asian nations. Also being considered is an expansion of the ban on the purchase of petroleum products sold by companies controlled by the country's elite military force, the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps.<\/p><p>The Revolutionary Guards are also believed to oversee the military side of the nuclear program, and they are the parent of the Quds Force, which Washington has accused of directing the assassination plot.<\/p><p>The proposed sanctions come as administration officials confront skepticism around the world about their allegations that Iran was behind the plot and limited options about what they can do \u2014 as well as growing pressure from Republicans and some Democrats in Congress to take tougher action against Iran, with the central bank and the oil industry high on lawmakers' lists.<\/p><p>All of the proposed sanctions carry with them considerable political and economic risks. Yukiya Amano, the cautious director general of the United Nations group, the International Atomic Energy Agency, talked publicly in September about publishing some of the most delicate data suggesting Iran worked on nuclear triggers and warheads. But officials who have spoken with him say he is concerned that his inspectors could be ejected from Iran, shutting the best, though narrow, window into its nuclear activities.<\/p><p>Similarly, China and Russia, among other major Iranian trading partners, have resisted further oil and financial sanctions, saying the goal of isolating Iran is a poor strategy. Even inside the Obama administration, some officials say they fear any crackdown on Iranian oil exports could drive up oil prices when the United States and European economies are weak. As one senior official put it, \"You don't want to tip the U.S. into a downturn just to punish the Iranians.\"<\/p><p>Senior administration officials, who would not speak publicly about internal negotiations over the sanctions, say no recommendation on acting against the central bank has gone to Mr. Obama, who vowed last week to make sure Iran would face the \"toughest sanctions\" for what he said was its role in the sensational scheme to hire a Mexican drug cartel to kill the Saudi envoy.<\/p><p>The decision to press the International Atomic Energy Agency was brewing even before the plot against the Saudi ambassador was discovered, but that discovery prompted the White House to pursue a full-court, public press of the agency to release the sensitive intelligence.<\/p><p>Officials familiar with the evidence say it creates extraordinarily uncomfortable questions for the Iranians to answer, but does not definitively point to the construction of a weapon. Instead, it details work on individual technologies essential for designing and detonating a nuclear device, including how to turn uranium into bomb fuel, how to cast conventional explosives in a shape that can set off a nuclear blast, and how to make detonators, generate neutrons to spur a chain reaction, measure detonation waves and make nose cones for missiles.<\/p><p>Tommy Vietor, the spokesman for the National Security Council, said Saturday that \"the United States believes that a comprehensive assessment would be invaluable for the international community in its consideration of Iran's nuclear program and what to do about it.\" Iran has declared that all of the documents suggesting work on how to create a weapon that could fit atop an Iranian missile are \"fabrications\" intended to justify an attack. The country has been the target of covert attacks, including the assassinations of some nuclear scientists and a computer worm that disabled some of Iran's nuclear centrifuges.<\/p><p>The Obama administration, since coming to office, has never publicly presented detailed evidence to back up its claim that Iran is driving toward a weapon or creating the technology to assemble one quickly, should it need it. But it has discussed the evidence widely with allies.<\/p><p>In part the administration has hesitated to discuss the evidence because, after the failure to find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq in 2003, any American evidence is considered suspect. Widespread questions about the plot against the Saudis last week underscored how deep those suspicions run.<\/p><p>But Iran is a different kind of case. Inspectors visit regularly, measuring Iran's output of uranium, including recent production of the material, enriched to 20 percent purity, that takes it far closer to the kind of fuel needed for a weapon. Iran said recently that it would produce more of the 20 percent enriched material than it needs for a small medical research reactor, which prompted new concerns that it is building a stockpile that could be converted to weapons use.","201":"Though it may feel out of the way \u2014 far, far east on the Lower East Side \u2014 there's no missing American Realness once you get there.

Beginning with its shot of a Pontiac GTO pulling doughnuts in a high school parking lot to Aerosmith's \"Sweet Emotion,\" \"Dazed\" is such a humane approximation of what it was like to come of age in the mid-1970s that one wishes it would never end.

A high school pitching star and rangy college prospect, he's assigned an off-campus baseball dorm with the other players. It's a ready-made animal house, with rules laid down by a briefly seen coach (Jonathan Breck) that are immediately ignored.

These, too, are ignored.<\/p><p>Instead, Linklater parks his cameras to observe, with indulgence and much good humor, the bonding rituals of young men who only think they have it figured out.

Yes and no, or, rather, yes, but only at first. As the boys sprawl through the last days of summer, the swagger that borders on smug begins to mellow and melt away. Searching for good times and girls, they hop from a disco one night to a country and western bar the next to a punk mosh pit to an art-student costume party, minds open, adapting, ever-changing. After a while, the hero starts having a smallish identity crisis, confessing that \"it sort of begs the question of who we are.\"<\/p><p>Well, yes. This is college, Jake. Even a high school sports star can be anyone he wants.<\/p><p>The movie eventually spins him off from the crowd into the arms of Beverly (Zoey Deutch), a tartly ardent stage arts freshman with Joni Mitchell posters on her wall. She's unpretentious for a theater brat, he's smart and soulful for a jock, and the two stand dazzled in the Venn diagram overlap of their attraction. These scenes try a little too hard to be charming but they are anyway, and if Deutch has the freckles and immediacy of a classic Brat Pack heroine, it may be because her mother is Lea Thompson of \"Back to the Future\" and \"Some Kind of Wonderful\" and her father is Howard Deutch, who directed the latter.<\/p><p>More second-generation pleasures: Wyatt Russell, who plays the woolly baseball mystic Willoughby, is the son of Kurt Russell and Goldie Hawn, and he has a high old time \u2014 emphasis on high \u2014 explaining to his teammates why \"Fearless,\" from the 1971 album \"Meddle,\" is the best track that Pink Floyd ever recorded.

The president's push is part of a larger American effort to further isolate and increase pressure on Iran after accusing it of a plot to assassinate Saudi Arabia's ambassador to the United States.<\/p><p>If the United Nations' watchdog group agrees to publicize the evidence, including new data from recent months, it would almost certainly revive a debate that has been dormant during the Arab Spring about how aggressively the United States and its allies, including Israel, should move to halt Iran's suspected weapons program.<\/p><p>Over the longer term, several senior Obama administration officials said in interviews, they are mulling a ban on financial transactions with Iran's central bank \u2014 a move that has been opposed by China and other Asian nations. Also being considered is an expansion of the ban on the purchase of petroleum products sold by companies controlled by the country's elite military force, the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps.<\/p><p>The Revolutionary Guards are also believed to oversee the military side of the nuclear program, and they are the parent of the Quds Force, which Washington has accused of directing the assassination plot.<\/p><p>The proposed sanctions come as administration officials confront skepticism around the world about their allegations that Iran was behind the plot and limited options about what they can do \u2014 as well as growing pressure from Republicans and some Democrats in Congress to take tougher action against Iran, with the central bank and the oil industry high on lawmakers' lists.<\/p><p>All of the proposed sanctions carry with them considerable political and economic risks. Yukiya Amano, the cautious director general of the United Nations group, the International Atomic Energy Agency, talked publicly in September about publishing some of the most delicate data suggesting Iran worked on nuclear triggers and warheads. But officials who have spoken with him say he is concerned that his inspectors could be ejected from Iran, shutting the best, though narrow, window into its nuclear activities.<\/p><p>Similarly, China and Russia, among other major Iranian trading partners, have resisted further oil and financial sanctions, saying the goal of isolating Iran is a poor strategy. Even inside the Obama administration, some officials say they fear any crackdown on Iranian oil exports could drive up oil prices when the United States and European economies are weak. As one senior official put it, \"You don't want to tip the U.S. into a downturn just to punish the Iranians.\"<\/p><p>Senior administration officials, who would not speak publicly about internal negotiations over the sanctions, say no recommendation on acting against the central bank has gone to Mr. Obama, who vowed last week to make sure Iran would face the \"toughest sanctions\" for what he said was its role in the sensational scheme to hire a Mexican drug cartel to kill the Saudi envoy.<\/p><p>The decision to press the International Atomic Energy Agency was brewing even before the plot against the Saudi ambassador was discovered, but that discovery prompted the White House to pursue a full-court, public press of the agency to release the sensitive intelligence.<\/p><p>Officials familiar with the evidence say it creates extraordinarily uncomfortable questions for the Iranians to answer, but does not definitively point to the construction of a weapon. Instead, it details work on individual technologies essential for designing and detonating a nuclear device, including how to turn uranium into bomb fuel, how to cast conventional explosives in a shape that can set off a nuclear blast, and how to make detonators, generate neutrons to spur a chain reaction, measure detonation waves and make nose cones for missiles.<\/p><p>Tommy Vietor, the spokesman for the National Security Council, said Saturday that \"the United States believes that a comprehensive assessment would be invaluable for the international community in its consideration of Iran's nuclear program and what to do about it.\" Iran has declared that all of the documents suggesting work on how to create a weapon that could fit atop an Iranian missile are \"fabrications\" intended to justify an attack. The country has been the target of covert attacks, including the assassinations of some nuclear scientists and a computer worm that disabled some of Iran's nuclear centrifuges.<\/p><p>The Obama administration, since coming to office, has never publicly presented detailed evidence to back up its claim that Iran is driving toward a weapon or creating the technology to assemble one quickly, should it need it. But it has discussed the evidence widely with allies.<\/p><p>In part the administration has hesitated to discuss the evidence because, after the failure to find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq in 2003, any American evidence is considered suspect. Widespread questions about the plot against the Saudis last week underscored how deep those suspicions run.<\/p><p>But Iran is a different kind of case. Inspectors visit regularly, measuring Iran's output of uranium, including recent production of the material, enriched to 20 percent purity, that takes it far closer to the kind of fuel needed for a weapon. Iran said recently that it would produce more of the 20 percent enriched material than it needs for a small medical research reactor, which prompted new concerns that it is building a stockpile that could be converted to weapons use.","206":"Despite the firestorm over his comments about rape and pregnancy, Representative Todd Akin says he has no plans to drop out as the Republican Senate nominee in Missouri.<\/p><p>But what if he did?<\/p><p>The procedures in Missouri to change nominees midstream are complicated and intended to discourage just the sort of change that many in the Republican Party say they are eager to see happen.<\/p><p>\"As more time passes, you're starting to go up against deadlines,\" said Stacie Temple, a spokeswoman for Missouri's secretary of state, Robin Carnahan, a Democrat. Ms. Temple said the longer Mr. Akin waited, the more difficult it would get.<\/p><p>The first deadline for Mr. Akin to have easily withdrawn from the race was Tuesday evening. His decision to stay in the race means that he now has only a few weeks to reconsider before things get even harder.<\/p><p>Certification of the presidential ballots in Missouri will be no later than Sept. 17, and could be shortly after President Obama officially accepts the Democratic nomination on Sept. 5.<\/p><p>Once the ballots are printed, any candidate who seeks to withdraw must pay for the reprinting of new ballots. That could be prohibitively expensive for Mr. Akin, but presumably the Republican Party \u2014 which badly wants him to withdraw \u2014 would cover the cost.<\/p><p>Military overseas ballots begin shipping out Sept. 22. That might be the first firm deadline. But the drop-dead deadline is Sept. 25, when general absentee ballots are sent out.<\/p><p>Mel Carnahan, the former Missouri governor and Ms. Carnahan's father, died on Oct. 16, 2000, during his campaign for the Senate against the Republican incumbent, John Ashcroft. Mr. Carnahan's name nonetheless appeared on the ballot in November \u2014 and he won. (His widow, Jean, was appointed to the seat, and lost it in special election in 2002.)<\/p><p>Assuming that Mr. Akin bows to pressure from Republican leaders (or simply concludes that he isn't able to raise enough money to mount a credible campaign), Missouri law requires that he seek a court order allowing him to drop out of the race.<\/p><p>State officials say that issuing such court orders is routine. Mr. Akin would merely have to file the necessary papers with the court and his name would no longer be printed on the November ballot. Republicans could then quickly nominate someone else to run against Senator Claire McCaskill, the Democratic incumbent.<\/p><p>Democrats would no doubt like to see Mr. Akin \u2014 now politically weakened by his comments on rape and pregnancy \u2014 stay in the race. In theory, the Democratic officials who run the state's election offices could object to Mr. Akin's request for a court order, a move that would force a hearing before a judge.<\/p><p>The relevant statute says someone like Mr. Akin can withdraw \"pursuant to a court order, which, except for good cause shown by the election authority in opposition thereto, shall be freely given upon application by the candidate to the circuit court in the county of such candidate's residence.\"<\/p><p>Election officials say they can find no precedent at all for such an objection in the state's history. But Ms. Carnahan is herself a factor in Republican minds. As the Democratic Senate nominee in 2010, she lost to Representative Roy Blunt, and Republicans imagine she could put up a fight.<\/p><p>\"The secretary's job is to protect the rights of Missouri voters,\" Ms. Temple said when asked whether Ms. Carnahan would fight a court order to remove Mr. Akin's name from the ballot.<\/p><p>A further complication: Under state law, any election authority in Missouri can oppose a withdrawal order, down to the county and city level, and there are Democrats aplenty in Missouri. But Ms. Temple added that right now, it would be up to a Missouri court to determine whether Mr. Akin could withdraw, not the secretary of state.<\/p><p>\"It's completely in the hands of the court to decide the facts,\" she said.<\/p><p>Assuming Mr. Akin does manage to drop out, the state central committee of the Republican Party in Missouri would have to pick a new candidate within 28 days, or by Oct. 12, whichever comes first.","207":"Writer-director Richard Linklater has described his latest film, \"Everybody Wants Some!!,\" as a \"spiritual sequel\" to 1993's \"Dazed and Confused.\" That made my heart fibrillate a little, and maybe yours too.

Recently, the Los Angeles based-comedian started working one very personal, serious experience into her routine.<\/p><p>on Monday to open up about a violent relationship with an ex boyfriend, sharing photos of her bruised arms and legs and explaining why she has decided to include discussions of the abuse in her stand-up.<\/p><p>\"Same girl in all of these photos (me). I've had an amazing year, and you've seen the highlights here, so these photos are an uncommon thing to share but not an uncommon issue,\" Stelling captions a collage of photos of her bruises and her onstage smile.<\/p><p>The comic, who released her album<\/p><p>this fall and has a Comedy Central special, was hesitant to openly talk about the abuse, especially within her professional world.<\/p><p>\"There are many reasons not to make an abusive relationship public, mostly fear. Scared of what people will think, scared it makes me look weak or unprofessional,\" she writes.<\/p><p>\"When friends or comics ask why we broke up, it's not easy or comfortable to reply; it doesn't seem like the appropriate thing to say at a stand-up show, a party or a wedding. It's embarrassing. I feel stupid. After being verbally, physically abused and raped, I dated him for two more months. It's not simple.\"<\/p><p>Ultimately, Stelling couldn't exclude such a significant piece of her story from her onstage persona, even if it meant risking ridicule from the close-knit comedy community.<\/p><p>\"After I broke up with him, he said, 'You're very open and honest in your stand-up, and I just ask that you consider me when you talk about your ex because everyone knows who you're talking about.' And I abided. I wrote vague jokes because we both live in L.A., and I didn't want to hurt him, start a war, press charges, be interrogated or harassed by him or his friends and family. I wanted to move on and forget because I didn't understand,\" Stelling shares.<\/p><p>\"I don't want revenge or to hurt him now, but it's unhealthy to keep this inside because my stand-up is pulled directly from my life. It's how I make my living. My personal is my professional. That is how I've always been; I make dark, funny. So now I'm allowing this to be part of my story.\"<\/p><p>Stelling says she's already started joking about the relationship and asked her followers to \"have the courage to listen and accept.\"<\/p><p>So far, the funny lady has been getting a positive response to her openness at the mic.<\/p><p>\"Already since talking about this onstage, many women have come to me after shows asking me to keep doing it,\" she says on Instagram. \"Men have shown their solidarity.\"","211":"Talk to anyone involved in the action-movie glory days of the 1980s and the first thing they'll say is that it's time to bring those days back. \"In today's world. we need heroes,\" Aaron Norris, brother of Chuck and an important behind-the-scenes figure in that heyday, told us when we interviewed him recently. \"Our action movies have gotten too artsy.\"<\/p><p>Artsy sort of left the room this weekend, when Sylvester Stallone's \"The Expendables,\" which assembled a team of muscle-bound mercenaries to fight indisputably evil (but ideologically harmless) enemies in far-off lands, got audiences excited, to<\/p><p>Until this weekend, old-school action movies -- defined, for argument's sake, as films with a slew of explosions, a shortage of moral ambiguity and a triumph of physical effects over digital ones -- had seen better days. It's been nearly two decades since pictures of this sort were produced with any regularity by the studio system, and a lot longer since they were stateside successes. Many of the attempts in recent years have been, at best, mid-budget passion projects with circumscribed audiences (Stallone's own<\/p><p>which topped out at $42 million domestically) or post-modern winks (the French-language \"JCVD\" from 2008, a hostage movie in which Jean-Claude Van Damme plays a version of himself). The few large-scale attempts, like \"The A-Team,\" underperformed. (The biceps-and-bullets remake grossed $77 million domestically, a number that will likely be easily surpassed by \"The Expendables.\")<\/p><p>But the Stallone picture -- with its hard-charging, take-no-prisoners patriotism unbothered by the vagaries of the real world (it takes place in a fictional country, for starters) and its caricature of freedom-hating enemies (\"We will kill this American disease,\" as the TV spot enticed us) -- planted itself squarely in the old-school genre. And this weekend, the movie showed that there's life in that category yet. That \"Scott Pilgrim vs. the World,\" the tongue-in-cheek, pop-culture-referential, decidedly 2010 creation -- the one for, of and by arch fanboys -- trailed well behind \"The Expendables\" only drove home the point more loudly.<\/p><p>On one hand, it's understandable that a movie of easy American heroism (OK, first-world Western heroism) would catch on. In fact, it's surprising it didn't happen sooner. Apple-pie-patriotism already is behind the success of a cable news network and supports large sections of the contemporary country music industry. Why not a film hit too?<\/p><p>But among all the factors to which one might point in explaining the success of \"The Expendables\" -- a cast harvested from so many demographics and eras; a moviegoer backlash to 3-D and CG effects -- it somehow doesn't feel that the demand for neat heroes and villains is one of them.<\/p><p>Norris and his ilk would submit that in our current period of ideological and geopolitical upheaval, in a time of blurry lines between enemies and friends in places such as Afghanistan and Iraq, that black-and-white heroes slake a patriotic thirst (and that, indeed, the movie-going world can support a lot more of them). But history argues the opposite: Those movies succeed when the culture at large is filled with clear-cut distinctions. On the other hand, when the zeitgeist is more cloudy, an entirely different kind of cinema prospers.<\/p><p>The post-WWII era and its mainly straightforward distinctions between good and evil, to take an example of the former, yielded a flowering subgenre of movies with morally uncomplicated gunslingers. And 30 years later, the ideological simplicity of the Cold War and its larger-than-life Evil Empire gave rise to the very action movies on which \"Expendables\" is modeled (not to mention the ultimate in us-versus-them confections, \"Rocky IV.\" Yes, there's a Stallone-ishness to all of this). There are plenty of reasons why these types of movies faded from view in the 1990s, but the fall of the Berlin Wall and the the Soviet Union certainly played a part.<\/p><p>The examples are just as abundant on the other side. The ambiguities of the Vietnam War and the counterculture in the late 1960s and early 1970s undoubtedly offered up the moral murkiness of<\/p><p>\"Midnight Cowboy\" and scores of others. In the post-9\/11 world, meanwhile, movies like<\/p><p>-- with its themes of a destruction-bent enemy that can't be bargained with, and the question of what constitutes an acceptable ethical compromise in fighting that enemy -- have captured our imagination. You can throw<\/p><p>in there too, to the degree the movie was a contemplation of Western interests in the Middle East.<\/p><p>Political eras are, of course, rarely just one thing or another, and the movies we want to see in a given period are hardly monolithic. But as tempting as it is to infer that the success of \"The Expendables\" shows a deeper cultural need, it may well be the wrong inference. When times are confusing, we want movies to reflect that confusion, and even to make sense of it. But we probably don't want to pretend that confusion doesn't exist.<\/p><p>Photo: A scene from \"The Expendables.\" Credit: Lionsgate<\/p><p>Stallone: I'm contemplating an \"Expendables\" sequel<\/p><p>Hollywood wonders if Schwarzenegger will be back","212":"Tim Burrack, a northern Iowa farmer in his 44th growing season, has taken to keeping a wary eye out for unfamiliar vehicles around his 300 acres of genetically modified corn seeds.<\/p><p>Along with other farmers in this vast agricultural region, he has upped his vigilance ever since Mo Hailong and six other Chinese nationals were accused by U.S. authorities in 2013 of digging up seeds from Iowa farms and planning to send them back to China.<\/p><p>The case, in which Mo pleaded guilty in January, has laid bare the value\u2014and vulnerability\u2014of advanced food technology in a world with 7 billion mouths to feed, 1.36 billion of them Chinese.<\/p><p>Citing that case and others as evidence of a growing economic and national security threat to America's farm sector, U.S. law enforcement officials are urging agriculture executives and security officers to increase their vigilance and report any suspicious activity.<\/p><p>But on a March 30 visit to Iowa, Justice Department officials could offer little advice to ensure against similar thefts, underlining how agricultural technology lying in open fields can be more vulnerable than a computer network or a factory floor.<\/p><p>\"It may range down to traditional barriers like a fence and doing human patrols to making sure you get good visuals on what's occurring,\" Assistant Attorney General John Carlin, head of the Justice Department's national security division, said when touring Iowa State University.<\/p><p>But agriculture sector executives say fences and guards are not feasible, due to the high cost and impracticality of guarding hundreds of thousands of acres.<\/p><p>Tom McBride, intellectual property attorney at Monsanto\u2014one of the firms whose seeds were targeted by Mo\u2014said it safeguards its genetically modified organism (GMO) technology by protecting its computers, patenting seeds and keeping fields like Burrack's unmarked.

Over the past two years, U.S. companies, government research facilities and universities have all been targeted, according to the FBI.<\/p><p>Although prosecutors were unable to establish a Chinese government link to Mo's group, the case adds to U.S.-China frictions over what Washington says is increasing economic espionage and trade secret theft by Beijing and its proxies.<\/p><p>A U.S. law enforcement official told Reuters the agency looked for a connection between the Chinese government and the conspiracy carried out by Mo.<\/p><p>\"In cases like this, we can see connections, but proving to the threshold needed in court requires that we have documents that the government has directed this,\" the official said. \"It's almost impossible to get.\"<\/p><p>A Chinese embassy spokesman in Washington, Zhu Haiquan, said he did not have detailed information on the Mo case but that China \"stands firm\" on the protection of intellectual property and maintains \"constant communication and cooperation\" with the U.S. government on the issue.<\/p><p>On his visit to Washington last September, President Xi Jinping reiterated China's denial of any government role in the hacking of U.S. corporate secrets.<\/p><p>Mo, an employee of Chinese firm Kings Nower Seed, pleaded guilty to stealing seed grown by U.S. firms Monsanto, Dupont Pioneer dd and LG Seeds.<\/p><p>Prosecutors say he specifically targeted fields that grow the parent seeds needed to replicate GMO corn.

Five others charged in the case are still wanted by the FBI and are believed to have fled to China or Argentina. Charges were dropped against a sixth Chinese suspect.<\/p><p>The number of international economic espionage cases referred to the FBI is rising, up 15% each year between 2009 and 2014 and up 53% in 2015. The majority of cases reported involve Chinese nationals, the U.S. law enforcement official told Reuters. In the agriculture sector, organic insecticide, irrigation equipment and rice, along with corn, are all suspected to have been targeted, including by Chinese nationals, the official said.<\/p><p>Mo Hongjian, vice president of Kings Nower Seed's parent company, Beijing Dabeinong Technology Group, declined to comment on the case or on the company's connection with the Chinese government.<\/p><p>The parent firm is privately owned, but says it receives government money for research in \"science and technology.\"<\/p><p>China bans commercial growing of GMO grains due to public opposition to the technology and imports of GMO corn have to be approved by the agriculture ministry. Still, President Xi called in 2014 for China to innovate and dominate the technique, which promises high yields through resistance to drought, pests and disease.<\/p><p>In January, a Greenpeace report found some Chinese farmers are illegally growing GMO corn whose strains belong to companies including Monsanto, Syngenta syt and DuPont Pioneer.<\/p><p>Monsanto, which supplies Burrack's seed, said it can block foreign groups who request to tour their lab and learning center in Huxley, Iowa.

Burrack grows the corn in two fields in front of and behind his house where he can watch them, a small part of his 2,800-acre farm.<\/p><p>He said he is told by Monsanto where and when to plant the parent seed, but has never been told to keep what he is planting a secret.<\/p><p>\"What no one seems to understand is that they're stealing from people like me,\" Burrack said. \"They're stealing the research that farmers pay for when they buy Monsanto seed.\"","213":"Here are top moments from the House Select Committee hearing on Benghazi where former secretary of state Hillary Clinton testified.

The president's push is part of a larger American effort to further isolate and increase pressure on Iran after accusing it of a plot to assassinate Saudi Arabia's ambassador to the United States.<\/p><p>If the United Nations' watchdog group agrees to publicize the evidence, including new data from recent months, it would almost certainly revive a debate that has been dormant during the Arab Spring about how aggressively the United States and its allies, including Israel, should move to halt Iran's suspected weapons program.<\/p><p>Over the longer term, several senior Obama administration officials said in interviews, they are mulling a ban on financial transactions with Iran's central bank \u2014 a move that has been opposed by China and other Asian nations. Also being considered is an expansion of the ban on the purchase of petroleum products sold by companies controlled by the country's elite military force, the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps.<\/p><p>The Revolutionary Guards are also believed to oversee the military side of the nuclear program, and they are the parent of the Quds Force, which Washington has accused of directing the assassination plot.<\/p><p>The proposed sanctions come as administration officials confront skepticism around the world about their allegations that Iran was behind the plot and limited options about what they can do \u2014 as well as growing pressure from Republicans and some Democrats in Congress to take tougher action against Iran, with the central bank and the oil industry high on lawmakers' lists.<\/p><p>All of the proposed sanctions carry with them considerable political and economic risks. Yukiya Amano, the cautious director general of the United Nations group, the International Atomic Energy Agency, talked publicly in September about publishing some of the most delicate data suggesting Iran worked on nuclear triggers and warheads. But officials who have spoken with him say he is concerned that his inspectors could be ejected from Iran, shutting the best, though narrow, window into its nuclear activities.<\/p><p>Similarly, China and Russia, among other major Iranian trading partners, have resisted further oil and financial sanctions, saying the goal of isolating Iran is a poor strategy. Even inside the Obama administration, some officials say they fear any crackdown on Iranian oil exports could drive up oil prices when the United States and European economies are weak. As one senior official put it, \"You don't want to tip the U.S. into a downturn just to punish the Iranians.\"<\/p><p>Senior administration officials, who would not speak publicly about internal negotiations over the sanctions, say no recommendation on acting against the central bank has gone to Mr. Obama, who vowed last week to make sure Iran would face the \"toughest sanctions\" for what he said was its role in the sensational scheme to hire a Mexican drug cartel to kill the Saudi envoy.<\/p><p>The decision to press the International Atomic Energy Agency was brewing even before the plot against the Saudi ambassador was discovered, but that discovery prompted the White House to pursue a full-court, public press of the agency to release the sensitive intelligence.<\/p><p>Officials familiar with the evidence say it creates extraordinarily uncomfortable questions for the Iranians to answer, but does not definitively point to the construction of a weapon. Instead, it details work on individual technologies essential for designing and detonating a nuclear device, including how to turn uranium into bomb fuel, how to cast conventional explosives in a shape that can set off a nuclear blast, and how to make detonators, generate neutrons to spur a chain reaction, measure detonation waves and make nose cones for missiles.<\/p><p>Tommy Vietor, the spokesman for the National Security Council, said Saturday that \"the United States believes that a comprehensive assessment would be invaluable for the international community in its consideration of Iran's nuclear program and what to do about it.\" Iran has declared that all of the documents suggesting work on how to create a weapon that could fit atop an Iranian missile are \"fabrications\" intended to justify an attack. The country has been the target of covert attacks, including the assassinations of some nuclear scientists and a computer worm that disabled some of Iran's nuclear centrifuges.<\/p><p>The Obama administration, since coming to office, has never publicly presented detailed evidence to back up its claim that Iran is driving toward a weapon or creating the technology to assemble one quickly, should it need it. But it has discussed the evidence widely with allies.<\/p><p>In part the administration has hesitated to discuss the evidence because, after the failure to find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq in 2003, any American evidence is considered suspect. Widespread questions about the plot against the Saudis last week underscored how deep those suspicions run.<\/p><p>But Iran is a different kind of case. Inspectors visit regularly, measuring Iran's output of uranium, including recent production of the material, enriched to 20 percent purity, that takes it far closer to the kind of fuel needed for a weapon. Iran said recently that it would produce more of the 20 percent enriched material than it needs for a small medical research reactor, which prompted new concerns that it is building a stockpile that could be converted to weapons use.","217":"\"We don't want people coming back or visiting,\" Nugent said. The town is still in an \"imminent danger of fire,\" with several fires still burning nearby. \"I can see black smoke behind the courthouse,\" she said.<\/p><p>The fire in Presidio County has grown to 80,000 acres with only 10% containment, the Forest Service said early Monday.<\/p><p>That growth, according to fire operations chief Mark Sanford, came after the fire \"made a 12-mile run on Saturday.\" Officials still don't know what caused the fast-moving fire, he said.<\/p><p>Despite the damage, Nugent said things could be much worse. \"Tourism is huge\" in Fort Davis, she said, but none of the tourist structures have been burned. The downtown and the historic fort buildings are unscathed, she said.<\/p><p>The blaze, known as the Rock House fire, is currently the largest fire burning in the United States and is just one of 10 fires burning more than 312,000 acres in Texas.<\/p><p>Another 34 homes have burned in a fire in Midland County that has consumed over 16,500 acres and that the state agency on Sunday described as \"very active\" and not at all contained, officials said.<\/p><p>A Red Cross shelter has been set up at Midland College for those displaced or otherwise affected by this wildfire.<\/p><p>\"(Firefighters) can't outrun it,\" said Alan Craft, a spokesman for the state's Lone Star Incident Management Team.<\/p><p>Another large fire near Swenson has scorched some 103,000 acres in three counties, according to the state Forest Service. Spokeswoman April Saginor said officials believe the Swenson fire has been that large for a couple of days, but were not able to remap it until Monday.<\/p><p>As of Sunday night, the blaze across parts of Stonewall, Knox and King counties was totally uncontained despite the use of air resources, bulldozers, fire engines and other tools and personnel, a statement from the Forest Service said.<\/p><p>Official say this fire was caused by a man cutting a pipe.","218":"The Coworking Resources Series is supported by join.me.

Just gather at join.me.<\/p><p>If you've decided that it's time to leave your bathrobe at home, let your favorite coffee shop have its corner table back, and join a coworking space, you're only halfway there. Though coworking can have a lot of perks, how you take advantage of them and shape your experience is up to you.<\/p><p>\"We've had people who within the first week they've kind of immersed themselves [in]to events and socializing with other people here, or they're just here, they do their work, and then they take off,\" says Jeff Park, who manages the Ravenswood Coworking Group in Chicago. \"We know that they come in, but I think for them that's enough for them. They just want to be around other people in a productive environment.\"<\/p><p>Whether you're aiming to be as productive as possible without a lot of socializing or trying to build a strong professional community that you can turn to for resources and support, these five tips can help you get the most out of your coworking experience.<\/p><p>Green Spaces, a coworking space in Tribeca, specializes in environmentally focused businesses. Mountain View-based Cubes & Crayons combines childcare and coworking. WorkBar in Boston is hosted in a 2,500-square-foot space and has separate areas for cafe-like and quieter working styles. Coworking Brooklyn uses a small room that functions as an art gallery by night.<\/p><p>The coworking experience varies drastically depending on which space you're using. Different spaces have different levels of interaction with other workers, formality and general vibe. While some spaces, like Green Spaces and Cubes & Crayons, state their niche upfront, you'll only be able to gauge what the environment is like by dropping in. Most spaces have daily drop-in rates. Try a couple of different spaces to see what works best for you before you commit. You can find a list of space around the world on the Coworking Wiki.<\/p><p>\"See if the people in the space are people who you could go and see every day\u2026if it's not, then go to the next space,\" says Jay Catalan, the co-founder of a coworking space in Vancouver called The Network Hub.<\/p><p>It's less awkward to introduce yourself on the first day than to work alongside someone for months before asking their name. Even if you're not usually outgoing, try to make a special effort for the first week or two when you start in a new coworking space.<\/p><p>\"Just make introductions and it goes a long way\u2026We've had some people they wish they had met sooner because it turns out they did similar lines of work and just talking about it or actually sharing work, it's not something you want to find out when you only have a couple more months left on your project or something,\" Park says.<\/p><p>If you're shy about meeting people, try getting creative (like, for instance, bringing food). Bill Jacobson and Dave Ulrich, who co-founded WorkBar, said that one new coworker at WorkBar Boston showed up with a big box of doughnuts. \"He got to know everybody pretty quick,\" Jacobson says.<\/p><p>Don't stop interacting with your coworkers after you introduce yourself. One of the biggest benefits of coworking is the built-in community of professionals working across different industries.<\/p><p>\"It may not seem directly 'productive' to chat with your coworker for 10 minutes mid-day, but indirectly, it yields greater results than almost anything else you could spend time on,\" says Parker Whitney, office manager for Philadelphia coworking space Independents Hall, though he says, \"Invest in your community by taking (not faking) interest in what its members do, and it will take you with it\u2026The people you've always wanted to know are sitting all around you. Ask questions. Learn. Most importantly, help them when you can.\"<\/p><p>If you are too busy during the workday for water cooler conversation, most coworking spaces host happy hours, seminars or other events that are prime opportunities for learning more about your coworkers.<\/p><p>\"Even when you work for yourself, it's important to realize your limitations,\" says Dave Martorana, a freelance Python & iPhone developer who works at Independents Hall. \"If you're a software developer, you're not necessarily a designer, product manager, or marketer as well.

In its seventh edition, this annual festival of contemporary performance announces itself boldly, its name projected in big block letters on the facade of Abrons Arts Center, home to most of the festival's 18 boundary-blurring productions.<\/p><p>It doesn't take much to inject new life into an event sometimes at risk of stagnating, even as it champions the fresh, the unseen, the unexpected. At opening night on Thursday, visitors were guided from show to show through stairwells and hallways generally closed to the public. For anyone well acquainted with Abrons, as many Realness-goers are, this proved a simple, effective way to reinvent familiar spaces.<\/p><p>Masterminded by Thomas Benjamin Snapp Pryor, Realness coincides with the citywide conference of the Association of Performing Arts Presenters \u2014 international curators and producers in the market for new work \u2014 which returns each year like a recurring dream, or nightmare, depending on your relationship to the idea of shopping for live art. Last year's festival was full of work bemoaning the economic plight of performers; this year's first two productions struck out in less sullen directions, while still folding in some self-reflexive critique (also available in the form of Realness swag declaring, \"I Suffer From Realness\").<\/p><p>First was \"Culture Administration & Trembling,\" a biodiverse collaboration among the performers Jennifer Lacey, Antonija Livingstone, Dominique P\u00e9trin and Stephen Thompson. Ticket holders were instructed to remove their shoes, then led to the second floor of the arts complex, where a usually drab lobby had been transformed with geometric and botanical designs on the floor and walls.<\/p><p>Ms. Lacey, Ms. Livingstone, Mr. Thompson and Dana Michel crawled languidly around the asymmetrical room, the audience huddled around the perimeter, to a soundscape of intermittent bird song. Ms. P\u00e9trin appeared just as calmly immersed in her task of adorning the ground with origami squares. Three live snakes, delivered from offstage, soon joined in. Humans and reptiles slid over and around one another.<\/p><p>This was just the first of many tenuously related, increasingly chaotic episodes, including the arrival of two Chihuahuas (the snakes, not to worry, had exited) and a migration into the adjacent black-box theater for a ritualistic ringing of hand-held bells. A mysterious voice, accompanying a video projection, pronounced, \"This piece will not save us.\" Ms. Lacey, cradling a small, three-legged dog while bending and stretching her limbs, told a story about an artist and an institution (Realness, perhaps) trying to spice up their relationship like old lovers. What to do with all this information? I thought of dance as undomesticated wildlife, of the predators and prey involved in buying and selling performance.<\/p><p>Down one set of stairs and up another, in a tucked-away dance studio not often used for performances, the choreographer Heather Kravas, visiting from Seattle, offered the New York premiere of \"dead, disappears.\" Ms. Kravas was her own predator and protector in this stark, self-punishing solo, as she put herself through perilous paces inspired by the sculptor Richard Serra's \"Verb List,\" a series of actions that he associated with making his pieces.<\/p><p>What seemed at first like arbitrary acts of masochism \u2014 walking on tiptoe with a trash bag over her head while barking two-syllable phrases \u2014 deepened into a formidable exploration of language, the female body and the power play between them. Having duct-taped a pillow to a chair, as if it were a prisoner, Ms. Kravas pounded it with a long pole, shouting a list of alphabetized verbs, one per swipe. By the end, in whatever this struggle had been, she had secured the upper hand.<\/p><p>American Realness continues through Jan. 17.

Within two days on the market, however, there were 10 offers. \"Our was not the highest,\" Stephanie said. \"We wrote a letter to the owners about why we liked the house.\"<\/p><p>The letter, along with a photograph of the family, worked. What drew the Stahlbergs to the house were the solar panels and the trees and bushes \u2014 raspberries, blueberries, blackberries, strawberries, grapes, apples, plums and currants \u2014 growing organically on the property. The Stahlbergs also envisioned finishing the basement bedroom and bathroom for an au pair.<\/p><p>They also fell in love with the neighborhood. They would be within walking distance to a park and two libraries with story time for children.<\/p><p>\"We were trying to look at homes where we can walk to the Metro, or bike to the city or to the Metro,\" said Stephanie, 27.<\/p><p>Sears and Montgomery Ward kit houses: Cherrydale, once abundant with cherry orchards, is a family neighborhood dating to 1893. While many neighbors have lived in the area for as long as 60 years, newcomers move in and out these days, said Kathryn Holt Springston, who worked for the Smithsonian American History Tours Office as an educational specialist and historian for 28 years. She also served as curator and director of the Arlington Historical Museum and editor of the Cherrydale Citizens' Association newsletter.<\/p><p>Single-family homes, the Arlington public schools, access to bike trails and proximity to the District draw people to the neighborhood. Sometimes, though, they move in but stay only a few years. Finding a house in Cherrydale can involve the competitive process the Stahlbergs experienced.<\/p><p>About half a mile north of the Virginia Square and Ballston Metro stations on the Orange and Silver lines, Cherrydale has a variety of residences ranging from farmhouses to bungalows to Sears and Montgomery Ward kit homes with two to five or bedrooms or sometimes more. Many date from 1900 to 1930, though some of the older houses were purchased to be torn down and replaced with larger homes, including some built as recently as this year.<\/p><p>Living there: Cherrydale lies north of Interstate 66 and south of Lorcom Lane, stretching roughly from Utah Street on the west to the northward-curving interstate on the east. The Maywood neighborhood claims the eastern half of those boundaries north of Lee Highway, lending something of an arrowhead shape to Cherrydale. Since 1908, the Cherrydale Citizens' Association has planned activities and resolved neighborhood concerns. In the 1970s and 1980s, people often referred to the neighborhood as Mayberry, according to Springston, 63. In 1948, her parents bought the house where she lives with her husband and son. It dates to 1890, Springston said.<\/p><p>In the neighborhood, 49 properties sold in the past year, according to Billy Buck, an associate broker at Buck & Associates. The lowest priced was a one-bedroom, one-bath condominium for $200,000; the highest priced was a five-bedroom, five-bath farmhouse at $1.63 million. Twelve properties are on the market now, ranging from a one-bedroom, two-bath condo for $274,900 to a new five-bedroom, five-bath Craftsman house at $1.799 million.<\/p><p>Welcome wagon: The five-points intersection \u2014 Lee Highway, Old Dominion Drive, Quincy Street, Military Road and Quebec Street \u2014 is dotted with at least two car dealerships and other commercial establishments while nearby is a Safeway and the Cherrydale Hardware, which opened in 1938.<\/p><p>The Cherrydale Volunteer Fire House, built in 1919, is home to such events as the annual spaghetti dinner, concerts and for 90 years each December there is a visit from Santa Claus for children under 12. Other community events are the annual Fourth of July party and picnic at 21st and Stafford streets. A neighborhood with its own \"welcome wagon,\" Cherrydale has approximately 1,400 households and three parks as well as the Martha Custis Trail for biking, running and walking.<\/p><p>Schools: Glebe Elementary, Taylor Elementary, Swanson Middle, Kenmore Middle and Washington-Lee High.<\/p><p>Transit: The neighborhood is close to the Virginia Square or Ballston Metro stops on the Orange and Silver lines. Metro and Arlington Transit buses connect at Ballston and Virginia Square. Capital Bikeshare also is available.<\/p><p>Crime: From July 2014 through June 2015, according to Arlington County police, one robbery and two burglaries were reported in the area.<\/p><p>Harriet Edleson is a freelance writer.","221":"Here are top moments from the House Select Committee hearing on Benghazi where former secretary of state Hillary Clinton testified. (Sarah Parnass\/The Washington Post)<\/p><p>The House Select Committee on Blumenthal, as some are now calling it, came to order at 10 a.m. Lawmakers didn't finish questioning Hillary Clinton until 11 hours later \u2014 just after the Democratic presidential candidate succumbed to a coughing fit.<\/p><p>In that period of time, the name of Sidney Blumenthal was invoked more than 75 times, and scores of questions were asked about the longtime Clinton friend. By lunchtime, Blumenthal had been invoked 49 times \u2014 exactly the number of mentions of J. Christopher Stevens, the ambassador to Libya whose death in Benghazi is the supposed subject of the congressional probe. The other three Americans slain in Benghazi \u2014 Sean Smith, Glen Doherty, Tyrone Woods \u2014 got seven or eight mentions apiece, then-CIA director David Petraeus and former defense secretary Robert Gates each got two, and then-Defense Secretary Leon Panetta had none.<\/p><p>Dana Milbank writes about political theater in the nation's capital. He joined the Post as a political reporter in 2000.<\/p><p>Chairman Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.), reading from Blumenthal's e-mails to Clinton as if he were the teacher who had intercepted a note passed between two high school kids, said Blumenthal referred to Gates as \"a mean, vicious little\"\u2014 Gowdy paused. \"I'm not going to say the word, but he did.\"<\/p><p>He also quoted Blumenthal referring to then- national security adviser Thomas E. Donilon's \"babbling rhetoric,\" and he said Blumenthal had referred to \"Obama\" (he \"left the 'president' part out\") and \"his political cronies in the White House and Chicago.\"<\/p><p>Clinton refused to get riled. \"I don't know what this line of questioning does to help us get to the bottom of deaths of four Americans,\" she said.<\/p><p>But Gowdy knew. A couple of minutes later, he announced: \"I'll tell you what: If you think you've heard about Sidney Blumenthal so far, wait until the next round.\"<\/p><p>He and his colleagues made good on that statement, posing questions on a Blumenthal visit to Clinton's home, about his work for the Clinton Foundation, his business interests, his attempt to get a job at the State Department and his communication with the former secretary of state over matters as mundane as her new iPad. They were particularly concerned with whether Blumenthal's advice to Clinton on Libya was \"unsolicited.\"<\/p><p>The Blumenthal focus shows that, after 17 months of probing Clinton, the Benghazi committee hasn't come up with much. Blumenthal has been a Clinton hatchet man for years, and he has an unsavory reputation. The very mention of his name (he was prominent during the Monica Lewinsky scandal) lends a whiff of skulduggery to any situation.<\/p><p>But injecting Blumenthal as a central character in the Benghazi probe doesn't help Republicans demonstrate that Clinton did wrong. And the justification for invoking him \u2014 to demonstrate that Clinton had more contact with him than with Stevens \u2014 is a stretch. Whatever else one thinks of the former journalist \u2014 I've clashed with him over the years \u2014 he had nothing to do with what happened in Libya on Sept. 11 and 12, 2012.<\/p><p>Rep. Mike Pompeo (R-Kan.) acted as if he had found a video of Blumenthal attacking the compound himself. Pompeo, who had previously made the false allegation that Clinton got \"most of her intelligence\" on Libya from Blumenthal, asked whether Stevens had Clinton's personal e-mail, her cellphone number, fax or home address or visited her at home. \"Mr. Blumenthal had each of those and did each of those things,\" Pompeo concluded.<\/p><p>Rep. Peter J. Roskam (R-Ill.) thought he saw a smoking gun in an e-mail correspondence from August 2011 in which Blumenthal encouraged Clinton to \"make a public statement before the cameras\" when Libyan leader Moammar Gaddafi was deposed.<\/p><p>\"Two months before the end of the Gaddafi regime and you're already planning on how to make your statement dramatic to maximize political gain,\" Roskam scolded.<\/p><p>Relevance to the Benghazi attack? None.<\/p><p>Gowdy, for his part, found it damning that Clinton aides passed along some of Blumenthal's advice (which he got from a former intelligence official) to people including Stevens. \"It's relevant because our ambassador was asked to read and respond to Sidney Blumenthal's drivel,\" the chairman said, \"in some instances on the very same day he was asking for security.\"<\/p><p>Rep.

Dotted with pictures of scantily clad women, the website, BigBabyKenny, advises would-be Johns on the art of negotiating with prostitutes. \"Start with a compliment,\" Ng advises.<\/p><p>Needless to say, Ng's website is causing headaches for Northridge administrators. First publicized by the Los Angeles Daily News, the economics professor's site has drawn a wave of unwelcome attention, forcing administrators to at once criticize its content and defend Ng's right to publish freely on his own time without university resources.<\/p><p>\"Until we find representative evidence that it infringes upon the work he does at the university itself, there's not much we can do about it,\" said Harold Hellenbrand, Northridge's provost.<\/p><p>There may be subtlety in Hellenbrand's words, but his message is clear: If BigBabyKenny infringes on Ng's ability to effectively do his job, then Northridge's position will change. Ng has already said his site is run through a separate server not connected to the university, but Northridge officials might still make a case that the site has interfered with his job. Asked if students complaining that they were no longer comfortable in Ng's class would compel Northridge to demand the site be taken down, Hellenbrand said \"I'm not inviting complaints, but you just hit on the key issue.\"<\/p><p>\"If [running the site is] what he wants to do, and at the same time he wants to educate students and students flock away, then that would create a problem,\" Hellenbrand said.<\/p><p>How Ng came to be identified as the author of BigBabyKenny is a story in itself. A frequent tourist of Thailand, Ng took to blogging on the website of a Bangkok bar called Big Mango Bar. In one controversial post, Ng advised men to seek women near a particular Buddhist shrine.<\/p><p>\"The naysayers will say its creepy to be hanging around the Muariti Shrine, hitting on the emotionally vulnerable girls desperately praying and paying Buddha for a better love life but I beg to differ. Buddha works in mysterious ways,\" he wrote.<\/p><p>Perturbed by the post, the bar owners removed it. That led Ng to start his own site, prompting what Ng describes as a concerted effort by the owners to publicize his penchant for writing about prostitutes. They sent mass e-mails to faculty listed in Northridge's directory, and also posted on RateMyProfessor.com, warning students about Ng, he said.<\/p><p>Ng readily defends the content of his site and says he has no intention of taking it down.<\/p><p>\"The university has no stake in this one way or the other, and besides, professors can say whatever they want,\" said Ng, a tenured associate professor of economics.<\/p><p>Some question whether Ng has crossed a gray legal line, however, by advising men on sex tourism. Patrick Trueman, a former U.S. justice department official, notes that there are several federal statutes that could come into play. Within U.S. Code 18 are two sections \u2013 2422 (a) and 2422 (b) \u2013 that specifically prohibit anyone from \"enticing or coercing a person\" to travel internationally in pursuit of prostitutes. Moreover, one section specifically prohibits the use of the Internet to lure people.<\/p><p>While prostitution may be tolerated in Thailand, that's immaterial under the federal code, Trueman said.<\/p><p>\"Inducing and enticing?

John Foubert, an Oklahoma State University professor who researches sex trafficking, argues that women \u2013 often minors \u2013 are forced into the sex tourism industry and often have trouble escaping it. Even if Ng is operating within the bounds of the law, Northridge officials have an ethical problem they've yet to face, Foubert said.<\/p><p>\"Do they want to live with the blood on their hands of these girls that are being essentially raped by these men, who are going down and purchasing sex? I think that's a larger question,\" said Foubert, an associate professor of college student development.<\/p><p>Ng said he allows anything to be written on his site, so long as it doesn't involve pedophilia or underage sex. He does, however, write about how difficult it is to effectively negotiate with a \"half or sometimes fully naked teenage girl\" when she's \"expertly gyrating\" on a man's lap.<\/p><p>While his critics have been speaking out since fall, Ng said he has yet to hear from a student who expressed discomfort about his website.<\/p><p>\"The job of the university is to expose students to the world \u2013 not just a politically correct view of the world and not just the good parts of the world,\" he said. \"If a student reads that [site], I personally think it's good for them.

When the shoebox-shaped and nearly shoebox-size panini shop opened on Bedford Street 15 years ago, there was nothing quite like it in New York, a restaurant that kept things simple and kept prices low, serving flavorful food in a room that was just adorable enough that you could decide, midmeal, that maybe the two of you squeezed into the counter were there on a date, and not just grabbing a bite.<\/p><p>You have to fire up the Wayback Machine to better understand how 'ino helped change how this city eats. Fifteen years ago, New York was a bistro town. There was the old guard: Blue Ribbon, Le Gamin, Jules, Lucky Strike, Raoul's and a dozen others. Then in 1997, a newcomer opened in SoHo named Balthazar, which raised the stakes with its set direction and unlisted reservation line. Balthazar was white-hot: it had perfectly distressed mirrors, fresh and crusty bread, and although it was impossible to get a table unless you knew somebody who knew somebody, you could always go at midnight and eat at the bar.<\/p><p>Soon, New York was lousy with bistros. It was a good era if you wanted a kir, steak frites, escargot, fris\u00e9e lardon, profiteroles. Authenticity, or some version of it, was the point. Everybody was pressing butter into little ramekins to be served at room temperature, changing the paper covering the tablecloths before serving dessert.<\/p><p>Honestly, it was really fun. The restaurants were lively, intimate, sexy. So what if you could recite the menu before you set foot in the door? But if you were a young chef with a measure of vision and creativity, you were stuck either making onion soup and beet salad with goat cheese. Or you worked on the line executing the vision and creativity of an older chef in Midtown or TriBeCa. Prune hadn't yet opened. Neither had Diner. Brooklyn didn't have much of a food scene outside the restaurant row on Smith Street, which was anchored by Patois, a bistro. If you went to Williamsburg, it was to go to a party or to go dancing, not to eat. This was the landscape when Jason and Jennifer Denton opened 'ino on a quiet street in the West Village. The kitchen in the back was the size of a D.J. booth and used the technology of induction burners, which was novel at the time: it was a paninoteca that looked as if it belonged in New York rather than being shipped, tile by mirrored tile, from Milan.<\/p><p>The culinary vocabulary was Italian, but it wasn't sepia-toned and sentimental. Instead, there was a focus on ingredients at a time when, in New York at least, few people cared. It had simple food done well, and sometimes you encountered flavors that weren't lifted out of the songbook. I still have a 13-year-old memory of sharing a shredded duck sandwich with sweet relish, a combination that is about as authentically Italian as a functioning parliament. You could go to 'ino to get something familiar (prosciutto and cheese will never get old), but you could also try something new.<\/p><p>'Ino was a casual joint with integrity, an easygoing place where you could eat well as long as you didn't mind the wait. Today, we take this combination for granted, and expect all kitchens to put some effort into sourcing and display a little creativity no matter how limited the resources. That we do owes a little bit to 'ino.","226":"Termed a \"man of enough words\" recently by Jim Harbaugh, 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick needed just three syllables Sunday to explain why wide receiver Michael Crabtree has emerged as his favorite target.<\/p><p>In San Francisco's past three games, Crabtree has been targeted 34 times, 20 more than wide receiver Randy Moss, who is second in targets over that span. Tight end Vernon Davis? He has eight targets in the past three games.<\/p><p>It's hard to argue with Kaepernick's pecking order, given the results.<\/p><p>In a 41-34 win over the Patriots on Sunday, Crabtree (7 catches, 107 yards, 2 TDs) was featured on the 49ers' first possession - a tone-setting 63-yard touchdown march - with drive-opening catches of 11 and 13 yards. Kaepernick also threw his final pass to Crabtree, a 38-yard game-winner on a play that wasn't designed for San Francisco's No. 1 wide receiver.<\/p><p>In his past three games, Crabtree has 23 catches for 301 yards and two touchdowns with 90-plus receiving yards in each game. Prior to his streak, he had 90-plus receiving yards in five of the first 53 games of his four-year career.<\/p><p>In his five starts, Kaepernick has a 113.6 rating when targeting Crabtree, who has helped earn his confidence with reliable hands. According to Pro Football Focus, Crabtree has three drops in Kaepernick's starts, an impressive figure given the heat the Howitzer-armed quarterback puts on his throws.<\/p><p>On KNBR Tuesday, Harbaugh, who famously declared in the offseason Crabtree had the best hands he'd ever seen, crowed a bit when asked if there was a special Kaepernick-Crabtree chemistry.<\/p><p>\"Yeah, I think there is,\" Harbaugh said. \"But Michael has been doing this all year now. Talked about it every week, the ability to catch, nobody catches the ball better than Michael Crabtree. I think back to last summer when we were talking about the same topic. It might have even been on this show. A lot of people 'What? The greatest hands you've ever seen?' Nobody mentions that any more. Boy, the evidence sure is there.\"<\/p><p>With at least 10 catches and 132 yards over the final two regular-season games, Crabtree (73 catches, 868 yards) would become the 49ers' first 1,000-yard receiver since Terrell Owens in 2003 and will have the most receptions since Owens hauled in 100 in 2002.<\/p><p>Davis, who had team-highs in targets (eight), receptions (six) and yards (83) in Kaepernick's first start against Chicago last month, has since become an afterthought. He had one catch for 10 yards against the Patriots, and four catches, 29 yards and nine targets over the last four games.<\/p><p>Davis said he's yet to establish a chemistry with Kaepernick that matches the connection he had with former starter Alex Smith.<\/p><p>\"You have to develop that chemistry, that bond so you can be on the same page,\" Davis said. \"That's something me and Kaep don't have right now. We don't have it. You have to expect it because he just stepped in. Me and Alex, we've been here.\"<\/p><p>Asked why Crabtree has been quick to get on the same page, Davis said the red-hot wide receiver has been running shorter routes. However, he also noted, as Kaepernick did Sunday night, that Crabtree has earned his targets by breaking free from coverage.<\/p><p>\"Crab is a pretty good route runner,\" Davis said. \"He's getting open and Kaep is finding him.\"<\/p><p>Eric Branch is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.

Within six weeks of the firing on Fort Sumter, Gen. Benjamin Butler was forced to decide what to do with three slaves who escaped to Fortress Monroe on the north shore of Virginia's James River. Butler, certainly no abolitionist, nonetheless refused to return the three to their owner, labeling them \"contrabands of war.\"<\/p><p>The term, suitably ambiguous for an administration that as yet had no policy on how to handle the fugitives, found immediate acceptance. As one Union officer wrote, \"Never was a word so speedily adopted by so many people in so short a time.\" Within weeks hundreds of \"contrabands\" \u2014 men, women and children \u2014 flocked to Fortress Monroe and other Union Army positions. Unsure what might greet them, the escaped slaves were yet confident that life under federal control must surely represent an improvement.<\/p><p>It took the federal government more than a year to devise a policy in answer to this thirst for freedom. In August 1861, the First Confiscation Act stripped slaveholders of their claim of ownership, but it failed to clarify whether the slaves were themselves free. The following March Congress prohibited the military from sending escaped slaves back into slavery, and in July the Second Confiscation Act decreed that all slaves that took refuge in Union areas were \"captives of war\" and would be set free.<\/p><p>These legislative actions took on ever greater significance as Union forces moved deeper and deeper into Confederate territory. The growing number of contrabands reaching federal lines necessitated the establishment of dozens of impromptu contraband camps. A draft map compiled by the National Park Service illustrates how the network of these generally transitory camps mirrored the advance of the Union Army along the Mississippi, Tennessee and Cumberland River systems. Grant's Army of the Tennessee spent the summer of 1862 protecting supply lines in western Tennessee and northern Mississippi. Victories at the Battle of Iuka in September and the Battle of Corinth in early October solidified Union control of the area.<\/p><p>Lincoln's announcement of the preliminary Emancipation Proclamation on Sept. 22, 1862, produced an even greater flood of refugees. How best to use and care for these contrabands proved particularly vexing for military leaders under Grant's command. \"You have no idea of the consternation Old Abe's Proclamation is making,\" wrote Gen. Grenville Dodge to his brother in September. The contrabands \"will not even wait until 1st January. I do not know what we shall do with them.\"<\/p><p>Many of these fugitives arrived in an appalling condition. \"There were men, women, and children in every stage of disease or decrepitude often nearly naked, with flesh torn by the terrible experiences of their escape,\" wrote one observer. \"Often the slaves met prejudices against their color more bitter than any they had left behind.\"<\/p><p>On Nov. 11, 1862, Grant took the first step toward addressing the crisis: he named John Eaton, a former high school principal and chaplain of the 27th Ohio Infantry, as superintendent of contrabands and set him at work \"organizing them into suitable companies for working.\" A month later he went further. \"The negroes will be clothed, and in every way provided for, out of their earnings\" \u2014 about 12.5 cents for each pound of cotton picked \u2014 \"so far as practicable,\" he ordered. \"In no case will negroes be forced into the service of the Government, or be enticed away from their homes except when it becomes a military necessity.\"<\/p><p>Grant's policies lent the contraband camps an official status and began to define what a freedman could and could not do once within the Union lines. Personally, Grant appears to have had no particular sympathy for the refugees. He seems to have recognized that, in the words of one observer, \"The soldiers of our army were a good deal opposed to serving the Negro in any manner.\" Nevertheless, the Union commander unreservedly supported Eaton's work and in the process enabled the creation of one of the war's most successful contraband camps, located at Corinth, Miss.<\/p><p>Although formally organized under the direction of General Dodge in early December 1862 and placed under the command of James M. Alexander, chaplain of the 66th Illinois, the Corinth camp likely came into existence as early as September. Initially housed in army tents no longer considered serviceable for Union troops, the freedmen were soon set to work downing trees and clearing land on which to build cabins and lay out streets, which were named for Union generals. Eventually the freedmen also built a four-room school, a commissary, a hospital, a church and an office. The entire camp was divided into wards, complete with ward masters and a police force.<\/p><p>In late 1862 the American Missionary Association sent its first volunteers to Corinth to help care for, educate and minister to the freedmen. In a memoir written years after the war, one such missionary recalled her experience. \"When brought face to face with the slaves,\" she wrote, \"it was like the discovery of a new race.\" The men and women who came to Corinth generally shared a paternalistic optimism and viewed the freedmen as childlike in their enthusiasm for both education and salvation.<\/p><p>The freedmen's thirst for knowledge was undeniable. \"You will find them every hour of daylight, at their books,\" observed the Rev. Edward Pierce in March of 1863. \"We cannot enter a cabin, or tent, but that we see from one to three with books.\" Within no time Pierce and his wife had more than 150 students, and by the end of the summer, the addition of more missionaries enabled the school to accommodate between 300 and 400 children as well as 60 adults at a night school. In August, one of the teachers estimated that as many as 1,000 freedmen had learned to read in the Corinth camp.<\/p><p>Organized religion followed closely on the heels of formal education. Reverend Olds \"saw an earnestness in reference to the Christian life that I have seldom seen. And as I saw their deep earnestness & heard their hearty responses,\" he said, \"I was led to ask where can we find a more impressible people than these?\"<\/p><p>The population of the camp fluctuated between 1,500 and 6,000, as large groups undertook assignments for the Union Army or contracted to work on local plantations. In March 1863, for example, the camp was home to 658 men, 1,440 women and 1,559 children. Among the men were 36 blacksmiths, 48 carpenters, 180 teamsters and 200 cooks. The female ranks included 80 seamstresses, 150 laundresses and 600 cooks. Two-thirds of the men and three-quarters of the women were married, and seven in eight women had children. According to John Eaton's records, the camp had experienced 900 cases of illness, 189 deaths and 45 births.<\/p><p>Life at Corinth changed dramatically after a May 1863 visit by Adj. Gen. Lorenzo Thomas, who was intent on recruiting thousands of contrabands for his newly formed black regiments. With the organization of the 1st Alabama Infantry of African Descent, later renamed the 55th United States Colored Troops, the camp lost most of its able-bodied men.<\/p><p>Their departure to fight left only the women, the young, the old and the infirm to carry on Eaton's ambitious agricultural program, which rested on the cooperative farming of large tracts of abandoned and confiscated land. The program put 400 acres under cultivation, 300 for cotton and 100 for vegetables. Each cabin also had its own subsistence garden. By May 1863, the success of the agricultural program and the presence of a multitude of skilled artisans produced a clear monthly profit of $4,000 to $5,000 for the government, as well as an admirably independent community that Eaton hoped might serve as a model for other camps.<\/p><p>Unfortunately, the success of the Corinth camp proved short-lived. Plans for a winter campaign by Union forces in January 1864 provided a grim reminder that the fate of the freedmen was always secondary to the triumph of the Union cause. The order to relocate the camp's inhabitants 93 miles westward, to Memphis, \"fell like a bomb-shell among our contented people,\" lamented one missionary, \"but military orders are preemptory,\" and they \"must be obeyed.\" The freedmen left their \"well-organized village,\" gardens and farms to tdiv><\/p><p>The move from Corinth destroyed the spirit that had animated the freedmen's success. Some of the new refugees found work on confiscated plantations or in Memphis, but most lived in one of several camps surrounding the city.<\/p><p>\"The destruction of the Corinth camp,\" noted one historian, \"was one of the tragedies of the Civil War.\" Eaton's plan for large-scale cooperative farming fell victim to a bitter struggle between the War and Treasury departments over the leasing of plantations and was never implemented elsewhere. And no more than one or two other camps were able to replicate the strong civilian leadership, well-planned and policed living environment, and emphasis on education that made Corinth a success.<\/p><p>Had the government learned from the model fashioned in northern Mississippi between the fall of 1862 and early 1864, the newly freed slaves might well have enjoyed a far easier transition to life in postwar America.<\/p><p>Sources: Joseph E.

The president's push is part of a larger American effort to further isolate and increase pressure on Iran after accusing it of a plot to assassinate Saudi Arabia's ambassador to the United States.<\/p><p>If the United Nations' watchdog group agrees to publicize the evidence, including new data from recent months, it would almost certainly revive a debate that has been dormant during the Arab Spring about how aggressively the United States and its allies, including Israel, should move to halt Iran's suspected weapons program.<\/p><p>Over the longer term, several senior Obama administration officials said in interviews, they are mulling a ban on financial transactions with Iran's central bank \u2014 a move that has been opposed by China and other Asian nations. Also being considered is an expansion of the ban on the purchase of petroleum products sold by companies controlled by the country's elite military force, the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps.<\/p><p>The Revolutionary Guards are also believed to oversee the military side of the nuclear program, and they are the parent of the Quds Force, which Washington has accused of directing the assassination plot.<\/p><p>The proposed sanctions come as administration officials confront skepticism around the world about their allegations that Iran was behind the plot and limited options about what they can do \u2014 as well as growing pressure from Republicans and some Democrats in Congress to take tougher action against Iran, with the central bank and the oil industry high on lawmakers' lists.<\/p><p>All of the proposed sanctions carry with them considerable political and economic risks. Yukiya Amano, the cautious director general of the United Nations group, the International Atomic Energy Agency, talked publicly in September about publishing some of the most delicate data suggesting Iran worked on nuclear triggers and warheads. But officials who have spoken with him say he is concerned that his inspectors could be ejected from Iran, shutting the best, though narrow, window into its nuclear activities.<\/p><p>Similarly, China and Russia, among other major Iranian trading partners, have resisted further oil and financial sanctions, saying the goal of isolating Iran is a poor strategy. Even inside the Obama administration, some officials say they fear any crackdown on Iranian oil exports could drive up oil prices when the United States and European economies are weak. As one senior official put it, \"You don't want to tip the U.S. into a downturn just to punish the Iranians.\"<\/p><p>Senior administration officials, who would not speak publicly about internal negotiations over the sanctions, say no recommendation on acting against the central bank has gone to Mr. Obama, who vowed last week to make sure Iran would face the \"toughest sanctions\" for what he said was its role in the sensational scheme to hire a Mexican drug cartel to kill the Saudi envoy.<\/p><p>The decision to press the International Atomic Energy Agency was brewing even before the plot against the Saudi ambassador was discovered, but that discovery prompted the White House to pursue a full-court, public press of the agency to release the sensitive intelligence.<\/p><p>Officials familiar with the evidence say it creates extraordinarily uncomfortable questions for the Iranians to answer, but does not definitively point to the construction of a weapon. Instead, it details work on individual technologies essential for designing and detonating a nuclear device, including how to turn uranium into bomb fuel, how to cast conventional explosives in a shape that can set off a nuclear blast, and how to make detonators, generate neutrons to spur a chain reaction, measure detonation waves and make nose cones for missiles.<\/p><p>Tommy Vietor, the spokesman for the National Security Council, said Saturday that \"the United States believes that a comprehensive assessment would be invaluable for the international community in its consideration of Iran's nuclear program and what to do about it.\" Iran has declared that all of the documents suggesting work on how to create a weapon that could fit atop an Iranian missile are \"fabrications\" intended to justify an attack. The country has been the target of covert attacks, including the assassinations of some nuclear scientists and a computer worm that disabled some of Iran's nuclear centrifuges.<\/p><p>The Obama administration, since coming to office, has never publicly presented detailed evidence to back up its claim that Iran is driving toward a weapon or creating the technology to assemble one quickly, should it need it. But it has discussed the evidence widely with allies.<\/p><p>In part the administration has hesitated to discuss the evidence because, after the failure to find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq in 2003, any American evidence is considered suspect. Widespread questions about the plot against the Saudis last week underscored how deep those suspicions run.<\/p><p>But Iran is a different kind of case. Inspectors visit regularly, measuring Iran's output of uranium, including recent production of the material, enriched to 20 percent purity, that takes it far closer to the kind of fuel needed for a weapon. Iran said recently that it would produce more of the 20 percent enriched material than it needs for a small medical research reactor, which prompted new concerns that it is building a stockpile that could be converted to weapons use.","232":"\"We don't want people coming back or visiting,\" Nugent said.

Beginning with its shot of a Pontiac GTO pulling doughnuts in a high school parking lot to Aerosmith's \"Sweet Emotion,\" \"Dazed\" is such a humane approximation of what it was like to come of age in the mid-1970s that one wishes it would never end. On the evidence of \"Boyhood\" and the \"Before Sunrise\" trilogy, though, Linklater doesn't want any of his movies to end. Thus \"Everybody Wants Some!!\"<\/p><p>Which at first is different, sometimes jarringly so, before wading into the open-armed embrace of experience that marks this filmmaker's finest work. The tipoffs are those double exclamation points and an onscreen title font that recalls a Skinemax late-night movie circa 1981. What if you took one of that era's hormone-drenched stu-coms and put real people in it?<\/p><p>The year is 1980, actually, and Jake (Blake Jenner from \"Glee\") is arriving for his freshman year at (the fictional) Southeastern Texas State University. A high school pitching star and rangy college prospect, he's assigned an off-campus baseball dorm with the other players. It's a ready-made animal house, with rules laid down by a briefly seen coach (Jonathan Breck) that are immediately ignored. Occasionally we'll get an onscreen reminder of how many dwindling days and hours remain before classes begin. These, too, are ignored.<\/p><p>Instead, Linklater parks his cameras to observe, with indulgence and much good humor, the bonding rituals of young men who only think they have it figured out. Jake's housemates fall into general categories that re-sort themselves into individual personalities: The motor-mouthed ladies' man Finnegan (Glen Powell), the Zen surfer-stoner Willoughby (Wyatt Russell), uber-competitive McReynolds (Tyler Hoechlin), country rube Billy (Will Brittain), smartass Nesbit (Austin Amelio), na\u00efve Brumley (Tanner Kalina). And so on.<\/p><p>A few stand slightly outside the pack: the over-confident psycho-nerd pitcher Jay Niles (Juston Street, freakily funny) and the laconic second base star Dale Douglas (J. Quinton Johnson), whose blackness is rarely commented on. Where are the women? There to be chased and partied with and seduced. \"This is college, Jake,\" the hero is told early on. \"The girls can be as big sluts as the guys.\"<\/p><p>Oh, dear. Is \"Everybody Wants Some!!\" what happens when you people an entire Richard Linklater movie with Matthew McConaughey's horndog Wooderson from \"Dazed and Confused\"? Yes and no, or, rather, yes, but only at first. As the boys sprawl through the last days of summer, the swagger that borders on smug begins to mellow and melt away. Searching for good times and girls, they hop from a disco one night to a country and western bar the next to a punk mosh pit to an art-student costume party, minds open, adapting, ever-changing. After a while, the hero starts having a smallish identity crisis, confessing that \"it sort of begs the question of who we are.\"<\/p><p>Well, yes. This is college, Jake. Even a high school sports star can be anyone he wants.<\/p><p>The movie eventually spins him off from the crowd into the arms of Beverly (Zoey Deutch), a tartly ardent stage arts freshman with Joni Mitchell posters on her wall. She's unpretentious for a theater brat, he's smart and soulful for a jock, and the two stand dazzled in the Venn diagram overlap of their attraction. These scenes try a little too hard to be charming but they are anyway, and if Deutch has the freckles and immediacy of a classic Brat Pack heroine, it may be because her mother is Lea Thompson of \"Back to the Future\" and \"Some Kind of Wonderful\" and her father is Howard Deutch, who directed the latter.<\/p><p>More second-generation pleasures: Wyatt Russell, who plays the woolly baseball mystic Willoughby, is the son of Kurt Russell and Goldie Hawn, and he has a high old time \u2014 emphasis on high \u2014 explaining to his teammates why \"Fearless,\" from the 1971 album \"Meddle,\" is the best track that Pink Floyd ever recorded. Because he is correct, I am awarding \"Everybody Wants Some!!\" an extra half-star.<\/p><p>Linklater was a high school baseball player who went to Sam Houston State on a scholarship, and the movie is steeped in the lazy, rivalrous minutiae of college ball. Willoughby gets off a moment of bliss when he muses on the pleasures of pitching \u2014 \"It's lovely out there on the bump,\" he says \u2014 and we learn that it's the .230 hitters who are always the most superstitious. Also that it's possible to slice a pitched baseball in half with an ax. At one point, one of the characters gazes with incredulity at a crowd of fellow students and says, \"I know what we're doing here. We're playing baseball. What are they doing here?\"<\/p><p>\"Everybody Wants Some!!\" is a nice long soak in the Proustian detritus of its era. Beverly drives a Gremlin, Jake knows the secret of winning at \"Space Invaders,\" and people can still confidently begin sentences with the words, \"It's like Carl Sagan says. . .\" What \"Sweet Emotion\" was to \"Dazed and Confused,\" so the Knack's \"My Sharona\" is to this movie, and the soundtrack rolls forward from there: glorious junk from the days when Eddie Rabbitt, Eddie Money, Sniff 'n' the Tears, and the BusBoys meant something.<\/p><p>All that's missing is a plot. But Linklater doesn't do plot; he does life. Says Powell's garrulous Finnegan, summing up the art of both this movie and this moviemaker, \"I don't think at all. I just talk a lot. It's jazz improv. You're invited.\" And so are we.<\/p><p>Written and directed by Richard Linklater. Starring Blake Jenner, Zoey Deutch, Glen Powell, Wyatt Russell, Tyler Hoechlin, Juston Street.

Small businesses and families starving for credit will eventually get relief as the funding props up banks and they increase lending, but Rajoy didn't offer guidance on when.<\/p><p>Spain on Saturday became the fourth \u2014 and largest \u2014 of the 17 countries that use Europe's common currency to request a bailout \u2014 a big blow to a nation that a few years ago took pride as the continent's economic superstar only to see it become the hot spot in the eurozone debt crisis. Its economy is the eurozone's fourth largest after Germany, France and Italy.<\/p><p>Across the country, Spaniards reacted with a mixture of anger and relief to the news. The amount of the rescue fund, if all is tapped, amounts to \u20ac21,000 of new debt for each person in the nation of 47 million where the average annual salary for those with work is about the same amount and the unemployment rate for those under age 25 is 52 percent.<\/p><p>The country is already reeling from deep austerity cuts Rajoy has imposed over the last six months that have raised taxes, made it easier to hire and fire workers, and cut deep into cherished government programs including education and national health care.<\/p><p>\"It's obviously a shame,\" said civil servant Luisa Saraguren, 44, as she strolled on a sunny Sunday morning with her young daughter. \"But this bailout was fully predictable, and the consequences of this help are going to be a lot bigger compared to the cuts we've been living with already.\"<\/p><p>Rajoy took pains to avoid the word bailout Sunday, saying Spain's rescue package is a line of credit that its most troubled banks will be able to tap. The assistance will not come with the outside control over government macroeconomic policy like that imposed Greece, Ireland and Portugal when their public finances were bailed out.<\/p><p>He said interest rates on the loans will be considerably lower than the rate near 7 percent that Spain has been forced to pay recently on the international debt markets, a level that forced the other countries to seek bailouts.<\/p><p>Spain will regain the economic credibility it has lost by shoring up its banks, which will result in credit being restored so businesses and individuals shut off from loans can start borrowing and the economy will grow again, Rajoy insisted, again without saying when.<\/p><p>Europe's widening recession and financial crisis has hurt companies and investors around the world. Providing a financial lifeline to Spanish banks is likely to relieve anxiety on the Spanish economy \u2014 which is five times larger than Greece's \u2014 and on markets concerned about the country's ability to pay its way.<\/p><p>Spain's financial problems are not due to Greek-style government over-spending. The country's banks particularly its savings banks or \"cajas,\" got caught up in the collapse of a real estate bubble in 2008 that got worse over the past four years. However, as Spain's leaders have struggled for a solution to their banking crisis, the country's borrowing costs have soared close to the level that forced the governments of Greece, Portugal and Ireland to seek rescues.<\/p><p>Some of Spain's banks are struggling with by toxic real estate loans and assets amid fears the problem will get worse as more jobless people can't pay their mortgages. The Bank of Spain says the toxic loans and assets total around \u20ac180 billion. Nationalized lender Bankia SA, which has requested \u20ac19 billion in aid, has \u20ac32 billion in toxic assets. Around four other banks serving the domestic market are considered prime candidates for bailouts.<\/p><p>\"I could never get my mind round the scale of consumption in Spain over the past 20 years, having known it in the 1960s when it was still extremely poor,\" said Paul Preston, a history professor and expert on Spain with the London School of Economics. \"Lots of people enjoyed the consumer boom, but not everybody. Now everybody's having to pay for it.\"<\/p><p>Rajoy blamed Spain's woes on the previous Socialist administration of Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero without mentioning him or his government by name. Zapatero was ousted by Rajoy in a landslide last November by voters outraged over the Socialist handling of the economy.<\/p><p>\"Last year Spain's public administration spent \u20ac90 billion more than it took in, this can't be maintained, we can't live like that,\" Rajoy said.<\/p><p>But Socialist Party leader Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba said Rajoy should acknowledge that Spain is now in bailout territory.<\/p><p>\"The government is trying to make us believe that we've won the lottery, that the Three Kings of Orient have arrived, and that isn't so,\" Rubalcaba said.<\/p><p>After his press conference, Rajoy defended his decision to jet off an hour later to Poland to see Spain's famed national football team take on Italy in the Euro 2012 competition. He said he would be on the ground in Gdansk only for the game before flying back to Madrid Sunday night.<\/p><p>\"I'll be there two and a half hours and then I'll leave,\" Rajoy said. \"I think the national team deserves it.\"","237":"Some things are more important than football, and Leah Still is doing something that's much harder than anything that can be done on a football field.<\/p><p>Former Cincinnati Bengals defensive lineman Devon Still announced on Instagram that his daughter Leah is cancer-free.<\/p><p>Leah Still, 5, was diagnosed with cancer in June 2014 and given a 50-50 chance to live.<\/p><p>The Bengals kept Still on their practice squad after cutting him last year, according to SI.com, and he eventually made the active roster and appeared in 12 games.<\/p><p>Still again was cut in September and is currently a free agent, but he'll take Leah kicking cancer over signing with a team any day.<\/p><p>More from The Sports Daily:","238":"Though it may feel out of the way \u2014 far, far east on the Lower East Side \u2014 there's no missing American Realness once you get there.

Small businesses and families starving for credit will eventually get relief as the funding props up banks and they increase lending, but Rajoy didn't offer guidance on when.<\/p><p>Spain on Saturday became the fourth \u2014 and largest \u2014 of the 17 countries that use Europe's common currency to request a bailout \u2014 a big blow to a nation that a few years ago took pride as the continent's economic superstar only to see it become the hot spot in the eurozone debt crisis. Its economy is the eurozone's fourth largest after Germany, France and Italy.<\/p><p>Across the country, Spaniards reacted with a mixture of anger and relief to the news. The amount of the rescue fund, if all is tapped, amounts to \u20ac21,000 of new debt for each person in the nation of 47 million where the average annual salary for those with work is about the same amount and the unemployment rate for those under age 25 is 52 percent.<\/p><p>The country is already reeling from deep austerity cuts Rajoy has imposed over the last six months that have raised taxes, made it easier to hire and fire workers, and cut deep into cherished government programs including education and national health care.<\/p><p>\"It's obviously a shame,\" said civil servant Luisa Saraguren, 44, as she strolled on a sunny Sunday morning with her young daughter. \"But this bailout was fully predictable, and the consequences of this help are going to be a lot bigger compared to the cuts we've been living with already.\"<\/p><p>Rajoy took pains to avoid the word bailout Sunday, saying Spain's rescue package is a line of credit that its most troubled banks will be able to tap. The assistance will not come with the outside control over government macroeconomic policy like that imposed Greece, Ireland and Portugal when their public finances were bailed out.<\/p><p>He said interest rates on the loans will be considerably lower than the rate near 7 percent that Spain has been forced to pay recently on the international debt markets, a level that forced the other countries to seek bailouts.<\/p><p>Spain will regain the economic credibility it has lost by shoring up its banks, which will result in credit being restored so businesses and individuals shut off from loans can start borrowing and the economy will grow again, Rajoy insisted, again without saying when.<\/p><p>Europe's widening recession and financial crisis has hurt companies and investors around the world. Providing a financial lifeline to Spanish banks is likely to relieve anxiety on the Spanish economy \u2014 which is five times larger than Greece's \u2014 and on markets concerned about the country's ability to pay its way.<\/p><p>Spain's financial problems are not due to Greek-style government over-spending. The country's banks particularly its savings banks or \"cajas,\" got caught up in the collapse of a real estate bubble in 2008 that got worse over the past four years. However, as Spain's leaders have struggled for a solution to their banking crisis, the country's borrowing costs have soared close to the level that forced the governments of Greece, Portugal and Ireland to seek rescues.<\/p><p>Some of Spain's banks are struggling with by toxic real estate loans and assets amid fears the problem will get worse as more jobless people can't pay their mortgages. The Bank of Spain says the toxic loans and assets total around \u20ac180 billion. Nationalized lender Bankia SA, which has requested \u20ac19 billion in aid, has \u20ac32 billion in toxic assets. Around four other banks serving the domestic market are considered prime candidates for bailouts.<\/p><p>\"I could never get my mind round the scale of consumption in Spain over the past 20 years, having known it in the 1960s when it was still extremely poor,\" said Paul Preston, a history professor and expert on Spain with the London School of Economics. \"Lots of people enjoyed the consumer boom, but not everybody. Now everybody's having to pay for it.\"<\/p><p>Rajoy blamed Spain's woes on the previous Socialist administration of Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero without mentioning him or his government by name. Zapatero was ousted by Rajoy in a landslide last November by voters outraged over the Socialist handling of the economy.<\/p><p>\"Last year Spain's public administration spent \u20ac90 billion more than it took in, this can't be maintained, we can't live like that,\" Rajoy said.<\/p><p>But Socialist Party leader Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba said Rajoy should acknowledge that Spain is now in bailout territory.<\/p><p>\"The government is trying to make us believe that we've won the lottery, that the Three Kings of Orient have arrived, and that isn't so,\" Rubalcaba said.<\/p><p>After his press conference, Rajoy defended his decision to jet off an hour later to Poland to see Spain's famed national football team take on Italy in the Euro 2012 competition. He said he would be on the ground in Gdansk only for the game before flying back to Madrid Sunday night.<\/p><p>\"I'll be there two and a half hours and then I'll leave,\" Rajoy said. \"I think the national team deserves it.\"","240":"Now that Newt Gingrich has vaulted into the lead in the Republican presidential stakes, he's going to be seeing a lot more of this:<\/p><p>Calling it the \"dumbest thing\" he has done in recent years isn't enough. This is not going away.<\/p><p>But, Newt can turn his pas-de-deux on the loveseat with Nancy into an opportunity to promote a consistent and electable political message.<\/p><p>Because he will be asked about this at every turn, Newt will have the air time and the opportunity to tell the truth on climate change\u2014based upon real science\u2014and to interface it with a limited-government philosophy. The two are easy to do.<\/p><p>Start with the obvious. Instead of waffling on the subject, he could just point out that earth's surface temperature is about 1\u00b0C warmer than it was a century ago. There were two periods of warming, the first from about 1910 through 1945, and the second from the mid-1970s to the late-1990s. They were both roughly the same magnitude. Because the first one was long before we put the majority of fossil carbon into the atmosphere, Newt can say\u2014with scientific authority\u2014that the magnitude of 'natural' climate change is likely to be at least as large as what humans have done.<\/p><p>Then Newt should proceed to the future. It's not the heat, it's the sensitivity. How much it will warm in the future is a function of how sensitive the atmosphere is to doubling atmospheric carbon dioxide. There are a number of independent arguments now coming together showing that this value may have been overestimated. The reference for the most recent is a November issue of Science.<\/p><p>Next, a little refreshing honesty: in 2009, the House of Representatives passed a cap-and-trade bill (which the Senate did not) commanding that the average american\u201438 years from now\u2014be allowed the carbon dioxide emissions of the average citizen in 1867. Prior to its passage, Newt was undeniably for such a system. Newt could call that that the \"second dumbest thing\" he has done and be finished with it.<\/p><p>After setting the record straight, how about interjecting his own political philosophy? When asked what to do about global warming, he should give the honest answer: if the atmosphere indeed is not as sensitive to carbon dioxide changes as previously thought, the correct response is nothing.<\/p><p>That's because \"nothing\" really means something. Newt should channel his historian. When markets are free, capital supports innovation more efficiently than when they aren't. Think about the remarkable changes in energy and technology in the last 100 years. Isn't it rather obvious that the same will occur in the next century, if only we don't hinder capital development? Newt might even use the catchy saw (first sloganed by Northern Illinois Gas in 1972) the future belongs to the efficient, and that there are impressive market forces that advantage those who produce things efficiently or produce efficient things.<\/p><p>When the doomsayers say Newt is believing in a Deus ex machine to dramatically cut carbon dioxide emissions, he might point out that those were the same folks who, only a very few years ago, told us we were running out of natural gas. Innovation and capital revolutionized drilling and fracturing shale, and we now know we have literally hundreds of years of it under our feet. There are a lot more voters and delegates around the country who will benefit from the shale revolution than there are in ethanol-addicted Iowa.","241":"WASHINGTON \u2014 President Obama is pressing United Nations nuclear inspectors to release classified intelligence information showing that Iran is designing and experimenting with nuclear weapons technology. The president's push is part of a larger American effort to further isolate and increase pressure on Iran after accusing it of a plot to assassinate Saudi Arabia's ambassador to the United States.<\/p><p>If the United Nations' watchdog group agrees to publicize the evidence, including new data from recent months, it would almost certainly revive a debate that has been dormant during the Arab Spring about how aggressively the United States and its allies, including Israel, should move to halt Iran's suspected weapons program.<\/p><p>Over the longer term, several senior Obama administration officials said in interviews, they are mulling a ban on financial transactions with Iran's central bank \u2014 a move that has been opposed by China and other Asian nations. Also being considered is an expansion of the ban on the purchase of petroleum products sold by companies controlled by the country's elite military force, the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps.<\/p><p>The Revolutionary Guards are also believed to oversee the military side of the nuclear program, and they are the parent of the Quds Force, which Washington has accused of directing the assassination plot.<\/p><p>The proposed sanctions come as administration officials confront skepticism around the world about their allegations that Iran was behind the plot and limited options about what they can do \u2014 as well as growing pressure from Republicans and some Democrats in Congress to take tougher action against Iran, with the central bank and the oil industry high on lawmakers' lists.<\/p><p>All of the proposed sanctions carry with them considerable political and economic risks. Yukiya Amano, the cautious director general of the United Nations group, the International Atomic Energy Agency, talked publicly in September about publishing some of the most delicate data suggesting Iran worked on nuclear triggers and warheads. But officials who have spoken with him say he is concerned that his inspectors could be ejected from Iran, shutting the best, though narrow, window into its nuclear activities.<\/p><p>Similarly, China and Russia, among other major Iranian trading partners, have resisted further oil and financial sanctions, saying the goal of isolating Iran is a poor strategy. Even inside the Obama administration, some officials say they fear any crackdown on Iranian oil exports could drive up oil prices when the United States and European economies are weak. As one senior official put it, \"You don't want to tip the U.S. into a downturn just to punish the Iranians.\"<\/p><p>Senior administration officials, who would not speak publicly about internal negotiations over the sanctions, say no recommendation on acting against the central bank has gone to Mr. Obama, who vowed last week to make sure Iran would face the \"toughest sanctions\" for what he said was its role in the sensational scheme to hire a Mexican drug cartel to kill the Saudi envoy.<\/p><p>The decision to press the International Atomic Energy Agency was brewing even before the plot against the Saudi ambassador was discovered, but that discovery prompted the White House to pursue a full-court, public press of the agency to release the sensitive intelligence.<\/p><p>Officials familiar with the evidence say it creates extraordinarily uncomfortable questions for the Iranians to answer, but does not definitively point to the construction of a weapon. Instead, it details work on individual technologies essential for designing and detonating a nuclear device, including how to turn uranium into bomb fuel, how to cast conventional explosives in a shape that can set off a nuclear blast, and how to make detonators, generate neutrons to spur a chain reaction, measure detonation waves and make nose cones for missiles.<\/p><p>Tommy Vietor, the spokesman for the National Security Council, said Saturday that \"the United States believes that a comprehensive assessment would be invaluable for the international community in its consideration of Iran's nuclear program and what to do about it.\" Iran has declared that all of the documents suggesting work on how to create a weapon that could fit atop an Iranian missile are \"fabrications\" intended to justify an attack. The country has been the target of covert attacks, including the assassinations of some nuclear scientists and a computer worm that disabled some of Iran's nuclear centrifuges.<\/p><p>The Obama administration, since coming to office, has never publicly presented detailed evidence to back up its claim that Iran is driving toward a weapon or creating the technology to assemble one quickly, should it need it. But it has discussed the evidence widely with allies.<\/p><p>In part the administration has hesitated to discuss the evidence because, after the failure to find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq in 2003, any American evidence is considered suspect. Widespread questions about the plot against the Saudis last week underscored how deep those suspicions run.<\/p><p>But Iran is a different kind of case. Inspectors visit regularly, measuring Iran's output of uranium, including recent production of the material, enriched to 20 percent purity, that takes it far closer to the kind of fuel needed for a weapon. Iran said recently that it would produce more of the 20 percent enriched material than it needs for a small medical research reactor, which prompted new concerns that it is building a stockpile that could be converted to weapons use.","242":"Jess Quinn is training for a 10km race. (Instagram)<\/p><p>A young woman who lost her leg after a battle with bone cancer, has set her sights on stamping out beauty norms and expectations.<\/p><p>Jess Quinn, 23, lost her right leg when she was just nine years old.<\/p><p>\"Growing up and not being able to do the things I wanted, it got me down. I've had to find new ways of doing things,\" Ms Quinn told the Daily Mail.<\/p><p>Ms Quinn, who is now preparing for a 10km race at the end of the year, said getting used to prosthesis was overwhelming.<\/p><p>\"It was hard getting used to the prosthetic, I had expected to jump on it and be sweet. I didn't realise the amount of work going into it, it was quite shocking.<\/p><p>\"I'm still trying to figure it out now; it's one of those ongoing things.\"<\/p><p>Having never run more than 600 metres, Ms Quinn is now undergoing intense training with her new blade runners in her quest to conquer the 10km race \u2013 challenging herself to \"go big or go home\".<\/p><p>\"I've always been really into health and fitness, even as a kid. After the surgery I wasn't sure whether I'd be able to run again.\"<\/p><p>Ms Quinn now counts herself as a social media influencer, with more than 55,000 Instagram followers who throw their support behind her every step of the way.<\/p><p>\"I've never considered my cancer story any different but I am starting to realise how my outlook on life can help, people thrive on the real stories.<\/p><p>\"I want to reach out, not just people with disabilities but also anyone living with insecurities.<\/p><p>\"That's my goal, to help everyone from young and old to male or female. I don't want to put myself in a category.\"","243":"NEW YORK -- Ruben Tejada thinks Chase Utley's late slide that broke his right leg was dirty.<\/p><p>Speaking about the play for the first time since Utley ended Tejada's season in Game 2 of the NL Division Series against the Los Angeles Dodgers, the Mets shortstop said he's no longer upset over it.<\/p><p>Using a blue cane adorned with a Mets logo giving to him by the team's owners, Tejada hung out with teammates in the dugout before Game 4 of the World Series.<\/p><p>He says he's come to terms with what happened, even though he never responded to the message Utley sent him through captain David Wright. Tejada might never respond to Utley. But he's not angry.<\/p><p>''I'm really happy we're here and he's home,'' Tejada said.<\/p><p>Tejada said he needs to be in a walking boot for two more weeks, but vows he'll be ready for spring training.","244":"Though it may feel out of the way \u2014 far, far east on the Lower East Side \u2014 there's no missing American Realness once you get there.

Beginning with its shot of a Pontiac GTO pulling doughnuts in a high school parking lot to Aerosmith's \"Sweet Emotion,\" \"Dazed\" is such a humane approximation of what it was like to come of age in the mid-1970s that one wishes it would never end. On the evidence of \"Boyhood\" and the \"Before Sunrise\" trilogy, though, Linklater doesn't want any of his movies to end. Thus \"Everybody Wants Some!!\"<\/p><p>Which at first is different, sometimes jarringly so, before wading into the open-armed embrace of experience that marks this filmmaker's finest work. The tipoffs are those double exclamation points and an onscreen title font that recalls a Skinemax late-night movie circa 1981. What if you took one of that era's hormone-drenched stu-coms and put real people in it?<\/p><p>The year is 1980, actually, and Jake (Blake Jenner from \"Glee\") is arriving for his freshman year at (the fictional) Southeastern Texas State University. A high school pitching star and rangy college prospect, he's assigned an off-campus baseball dorm with the other players. It's a ready-made animal house, with rules laid down by a briefly seen coach (Jonathan Breck) that are immediately ignored. Occasionally we'll get an onscreen reminder of how many dwindling days and hours remain before classes begin. These, too, are ignored.<\/p><p>Instead, Linklater parks his cameras to observe, with indulgence and much good humor, the bonding rituals of young men who only think they have it figured out. Jake's housemates fall into general categories that re-sort themselves into individual personalities: The motor-mouthed ladies' man Finnegan (Glen Powell), the Zen surfer-stoner Willoughby (Wyatt Russell), uber-competitive McReynolds (Tyler Hoechlin), country rube Billy (Will Brittain), smartass Nesbit (Austin Amelio), na\u00efve Brumley (Tanner Kalina). And so on.<\/p><p>A few stand slightly outside the pack: the over-confident psycho-nerd pitcher Jay Niles (Juston Street, freakily funny) and the laconic second base star Dale Douglas (J. Quinton Johnson), whose blackness is rarely commented on. Where are the women? There to be chased and partied with and seduced. \"This is college, Jake,\" the hero is told early on. \"The girls can be as big sluts as the guys.\"<\/p><p>Oh, dear. Is \"Everybody Wants Some!!\" what happens when you people an entire Richard Linklater movie with Matthew McConaughey's horndog Wooderson from \"Dazed and Confused\"? Yes and no, or, rather, yes, but only at first. As the boys sprawl through the last days of summer, the swagger that borders on smug begins to mellow and melt away. Searching for good times and girls, they hop from a disco one night to a country and western bar the next to a punk mosh pit to an art-student costume party, minds open, adapting, ever-changing. After a while, the hero starts having a smallish identity crisis, confessing that \"it sort of begs the question of who we are.\"<\/p><p>Well, yes. This is college, Jake. Even a high school sports star can be anyone he wants.<\/p><p>The movie eventually spins him off from the crowd into the arms of Beverly (Zoey Deutch), a tartly ardent stage arts freshman with Joni Mitchell posters on her wall. She's unpretentious for a theater brat, he's smart and soulful for a jock, and the two stand dazzled in the Venn diagram overlap of their attraction. These scenes try a little too hard to be charming but they are anyway, and if Deutch has the freckles and immediacy of a classic Brat Pack heroine, it may be because her mother is Lea Thompson of \"Back to the Future\" and \"Some Kind of Wonderful\" and her father is Howard Deutch, who directed the latter.<\/p><p>More second-generation pleasures: Wyatt Russell, who plays the woolly baseball mystic Willoughby, is the son of Kurt Russell and Goldie Hawn, and he has a high old time \u2014 emphasis on high \u2014 explaining to his teammates why \"Fearless,\" from the 1971 album \"Meddle,\" is the best track that Pink Floyd ever recorded. Because he is correct, I am awarding \"Everybody Wants Some!!\" an extra half-star.<\/p><p>Linklater was a high school baseball player who went to Sam Houston State on a scholarship, and the movie is steeped in the lazy, rivalrous minutiae of college ball.

It's been nearly two decades since pictures of this sort were produced with any regularity by the studio system, and a lot longer since they were stateside successes. Many of the attempts in recent years have been, at best, mid-budget passion projects with circumscribed audiences (Stallone's own<\/p><p>which topped out at $42 million domestically) or post-modern winks (the French-language \"JCVD\" from 2008, a hostage movie in which Jean-Claude Van Damme plays a version of himself). The few large-scale attempts, like \"The A-Team,\" underperformed. (The biceps-and-bullets remake grossed $77 million domestically, a number that will likely be easily surpassed by \"The Expendables.\")<\/p><p>But the Stallone picture -- with its hard-charging, take-no-prisoners patriotism unbothered by the vagaries of the real world (it takes place in a fictional country, for starters) and its caricature of freedom-hating enemies (\"We will kill this American disease,\" as the TV spot enticed us) -- planted itself squarely in the old-school genre. And this weekend, the movie showed that there's life in that category yet. That \"Scott Pilgrim vs. the World,\" the tongue-in-cheek, pop-culture-referential, decidedly 2010 creation -- the one for, of and by arch fanboys -- trailed well behind \"The Expendables\" only drove home the point more loudly.<\/p><p>On one hand, it's understandable that a movie of easy American heroism (OK, first-world Western heroism) would catch on. In fact, it's surprising it didn't happen sooner. Apple-pie-patriotism already is behind the success of a cable news network and supports large sections of the contemporary country music industry. Why not a film hit too?<\/p><p>But among all the factors to which one might point in explaining the success of \"The Expendables\" -- a cast harvested from so many demographics and eras; a moviegoer backlash to 3-D and CG effects -- it somehow doesn't feel that the demand for neat heroes and villains is one of them.<\/p><p>Norris and his ilk would submit that in our current period of ideological and geopolitical upheaval, in a time of blurry lines between enemies and friends in places such as Afghanistan and Iraq, that black-and-white heroes slake a patriotic thirst (and that, indeed, the movie-going world can support a lot more of them). But history argues the opposite: Those movies succeed when the culture at large is filled with clear-cut distinctions. On the other hand, when the zeitgeist is more cloudy, an entirely different kind of cinema prospers.<\/p><p>The post-WWII era and its mainly straightforward distinctions between good and evil, to take an example of the former, yielded a flowering subgenre of movies with morally uncomplicated gunslingers. And 30 years later, the ideological simplicity of the Cold War and its larger-than-life Evil Empire gave rise to the very action movies on which \"Expendables\" is modeled (not to mention the ultimate in us-versus-them confections, \"Rocky IV.\" Yes, there's a Stallone-ishness to all of this). There are plenty of reasons why these types of movies faded from view in the 1990s, but the fall of the Berlin Wall and the the Soviet Union certainly played a part.<\/p><p>The examples are just as abundant on the other side. The ambiguities of the Vietnam War and the counterculture in the late 1960s and early 1970s undoubtedly offered up the moral murkiness of<\/p><p>\"Midnight Cowboy\" and scores of others. In the post-9\/11 world, meanwhile, movies like<\/p><p>-- with its themes of a destruction-bent enemy that can't be bargained with, and the question of what constitutes an acceptable ethical compromise in fighting that enemy -- have captured our imagination. You can throw<\/p><p>in there too, to the degree the movie was a contemplation of Western interests in the Middle East.<\/p><p>Political eras are, of course, rarely just one thing or another, and the movies we want to see in a given period are hardly monolithic. But as tempting as it is to infer that the success of \"The Expendables\" shows a deeper cultural need, it may well be the wrong inference. When times are confusing, we want movies to reflect that confusion, and even to make sense of it. But we probably don't want to pretend that confusion doesn't exist.<\/p><p>Photo: A scene from \"The Expendables.\" Credit: Lionsgate<\/p><p>Stallone: I'm contemplating an \"Expendables\" sequel<\/p><p>Hollywood wonders if Schwarzenegger will be back","248":"I think there's a real possibility that there's going to be a substantial realignment in the political scene in this country, especially if nothing is done to satisfy these dissatisfied people.<\/p><p>The Trump phenomenon is really a reflection of what happened in the referendum, to some extent, and so is Podemos and so is Syriza and so is the Front National in France.<\/p><p>Unless the western world can somehow or other satisfy large numbers of its people that it can run the economy and the country in a way which is in their interests, I think you are going to finish up with this discontent.<\/p><p>If we are going to save liberal democracy, it's very important that something is done to get it back on track again.","249":"In a Facebook post on Sunday, 'ino announced that it had closed. When the shoebox-shaped and nearly shoebox-size panini shop opened on Bedford Street 15 years ago, there was nothing quite like it in New York, a restaurant that kept things simple and kept prices low, serving flavorful food in a room that was just adorable enough that you could decide, midmeal, that maybe the two of you squeezed into the counter were there on a date, and not just grabbing a bite.<\/p><p>You have to fire up the Wayback Machine to better understand how 'ino helped change how this city eats. Fifteen years ago, New York was a bistro town. There was the old guard: Blue Ribbon, Le Gamin, Jules, Lucky Strike, Raoul's and a dozen others. Then in 1997, a newcomer opened in SoHo named Balthazar, which raised the stakes with its set direction and unlisted reservation line. Balthazar was white-hot: it had perfectly distressed mirrors, fresh and crusty bread, and although it was impossible to get a table unless you knew somebody who knew somebody, you could always go at midnight and eat at the bar.<\/p><p>Soon, New York was lousy with bistros. It was a good era if you wanted a kir, steak frites, escargot, fris\u00e9e lardon, profiteroles. Authenticity, or some version of it, was the point. Everybody was pressing butter into little ramekins to be served at room temperature, changing the paper covering the tablecloths before serving dessert.<\/p><p>Honestly, it was really fun. The restaurants were lively, intimate, sexy. So what if you could recite the menu before you set foot in the door? But if you were a young chef with a measure of vision and creativity, you were stuck either making onion soup and beet salad with goat cheese. Or you worked on the line executing the vision and creativity of an older chef in Midtown or TriBeCa. Prune hadn't yet opened. Neither had Diner. Brooklyn didn't have much of a food scene outside the restaurant row on Smith Street, which was anchored by Patois, a bistro. If you went to Williamsburg, it was to go to a party or to go dancing, not to eat. This was the landscape when Jason and Jennifer Denton opened 'ino on a quiet street in the West Village. The kitchen in the back was the size of a D.J. booth and used the technology of induction burners, which was novel at the time: it was a paninoteca that looked as if it belonged in New York rather than being shipped, tile by mirrored tile, from Milan.<\/p><p>The culinary vocabulary was Italian, but it wasn't sepia-toned and sentimental. Instead, there was a focus on ingredients at a time when, in New York at least, few people cared. It had simple food done well, and sometimes you encountered flavors that weren't lifted out of the songbook. I still have a 13-year-old memory of sharing a shredded duck sandwich with sweet relish, a combination that is about as authentically Italian as a functioning parliament. You could go to 'ino to get something familiar (prosciutto and cheese will never get old), but you could also try something new.<\/p><p>'Ino was a casual joint with integrity, an easygoing place where you could eat well as long as you didn't mind the wait. Today, we take this combination for granted, and expect all kitchens to put some effort into sourcing and display a little creativity no matter how limited the resources. That we do owes a little bit to 'ino.","250":"Jess Quinn is training for a 10km race.

(The head-lopping is apparently his signature, like the mark of Zorro.)<\/p><p>In director Ridley Scott's thrilling, burnished epic, Maximus no sooner serves the empire by leveling Germania during a snowstorm than Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) tosses him a promotion he doesn't want - to succeed the aged emperor and whip Rome back into shape. All Maximus wants is to go home to his wife and child in the suburbs.<\/p><p>The careworn Russell Crowe is physically and temperamentally perfect for the part of Maximus. Still carrying some of the weight he packed on for \"The Insider,\" he's no gym-toned pretty boy. He's solid, beefy, rough-hewn, creaking along in his heavy leather costume, with a look on his puss of weary disdain.<\/p><p>What makes him sexy is his sense of honor and loyalty: \"What we do in life echoes in eternity!\" Anyway, it can't be his hygiene, although he is frequently bathed in a sanctifying golden glow.<\/p><p>After a coup by the emperor's weak-kneed son, Commodus (a whiny, surprisingly fleshy Joaquin Phoenix), Maximus' fortunes change. He winds up being thrown to the tigers, two shows daily, in Rome's Colosseum, the entertainment complex of its day.<\/p><p>Crowe, like his character, must grimly come to terms with the fact that, actor or gladiator, it's all about showmanship. Give the crowd what it wants, either at the multiplex or in the arena, and you can write your own ticket.<\/p><p>\"I have power only to amuse the mob,\" he spits contemptuously like a Shakespearean actor reduced to dinner theater.<\/p><p>The plot, about avenging honor, provides brief respite between an array of hand-to-hand battles that are pitched so furiously that individual components barely register; they're subliminal suggestions of computer-assisted carnage, with Jackson Pollock sprays of blood. For fans of the genre, yes, this is a good thing.<\/p><p>Connie Nielsen plays Commodus' sister and possible love interest for Maximus once his family is dispatched (politics, you know). Nielsen's costumes are laced up like bondage gear, and there is a tantalizing hint of romance past.<\/p><p>But the camera only has eyes for Crowe. The glowering! The seething! The hooded gaze! The quiet suffering! (Watch him carve away a tattoo he no longer has use for. No anesthetic! No disinfectant!)<\/p><p>The supporting cast makes for a gauntlet of worthy friends and adversaries, all of them thinkers, including Derek Jacobi (\"I, Claudius\") as a senator, Djimon Hounsou (\"Amistad\") as a fellow gladiator and Oliver Reed, who died with two days to go on the shoot, looking a little woozy as a gladiator entrepreneur.<\/p><p>Reed's character is the one most in touch with the movie's premise - that entertainment is the goal, and a worthy one at that.","255":"Writer-director Richard Linklater has described his latest film, \"Everybody Wants Some!!,\" as a \"spiritual sequel\" to 1993's \"Dazed and Confused.\" That made my heart fibrillate a little, and maybe yours too.

Dotted with pictures of scantily clad women, the website, BigBabyKenny, advises would-be Johns on the art of negotiating with prostitutes. \"Start with a compliment,\" Ng advises.<\/p><p>Needless to say, Ng's website is causing headaches for Northridge administrators. First publicized by the Los Angeles Daily News, the economics professor's site has drawn a wave of unwelcome attention, forcing administrators to at once criticize its content and defend Ng's right to publish freely on his own time without university resources.<\/p><p>\"Until we find representative evidence that it infringes upon the work he does at the university itself, there's not much we can do about it,\" said Harold Hellenbrand, Northridge's provost.<\/p><p>There may be subtlety in Hellenbrand's words, but his message is clear: If BigBabyKenny infringes on Ng's ability to effectively do his job, then Northridge's position will change. Ng has already said his site is run through a separate server not connected to the university, but Northridge officials might still make a case that the site has interfered with his job. Asked if students complaining that they were no longer comfortable in Ng's class would compel Northridge to demand the site be taken down, Hellenbrand said \"I'm not inviting complaints, but you just hit on the key issue.\"<\/p><p>\"If [running the site is] what he wants to do, and at the same time he wants to educate students and students flock away, then that would create a problem,\" Hellenbrand said.<\/p><p>How Ng came to be identified as the author of BigBabyKenny is a story in itself. A frequent tourist of Thailand, Ng took to blogging on the website of a Bangkok bar called Big Mango Bar. In one controversial post, Ng advised men to seek women near a particular Buddhist shrine.<\/p><p>\"The naysayers will say its creepy to be hanging around the Muariti Shrine, hitting on the emotionally vulnerable girls desperately praying and paying Buddha for a better love life but I beg to differ. Buddha works in mysterious ways,\" he wrote.<\/p><p>Perturbed by the post, the bar owners removed it. That led Ng to start his own site, prompting what Ng describes as a concerted effort by the owners to publicize his penchant for writing about prostitutes. They sent mass e-mails to faculty listed in Northridge's directory, and also posted on RateMyProfessor.com, warning students about Ng, he said.<\/p><p>Ng readily defends the content of his site and says he has no intention of taking it down.<\/p><p>\"The university has no stake in this one way or the other, and besides, professors can say whatever they want,\" said Ng, a tenured associate professor of economics.<\/p><p>Some question whether Ng has crossed a gray legal line, however, by advising men on sex tourism. Patrick Trueman, a former U.S. justice department official, notes that there are several federal statutes that could come into play. Within U.S. Code 18 are two sections \u2013 2422 (a) and 2422 (b) \u2013 that specifically prohibit anyone from \"enticing or coercing a person\" to travel internationally in pursuit of prostitutes. Moreover, one section specifically prohibits the use of the Internet to lure people.<\/p><p>While prostitution may be tolerated in Thailand, that's immaterial under the federal code, Trueman said.<\/p><p>\"Inducing and enticing? Isn't that what this guy's doing?\" said Trueman, former chief of the Justice Department's Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section in the Criminal Division.<\/p><p>Trueman, now a lawyer specializing in sex trafficking and child abuse cases, said there would likely be debate about whether talking about procuring prostitutes online and actually arranging prostitutes for a person should be treated differently under the law.<\/p><p>\"Given how lax the fed government is on these crimes, they may not charge somebody unless they are more directly involved,\" he said. \"That's not to say this person couldn't be charged, and as I read it they could be charged.\"<\/p><p>Beyond the legal implications, critics have already attacked Ng on moral grounds. John Foubert, an Oklahoma State University professor who researches sex trafficking, argues that women \u2013 often minors \u2013 are forced into the sex tourism industry and often have trouble escaping it. Even if Ng is operating within the bounds of the law, Northridge officials have an ethical problem they've yet to face, Foubert said.<\/p><p>\"Do they want to live with the blood on their hands of these girls that are being essentially raped by these men, who are going down and purchasing sex? I think that's a larger question,\" said Foubert, an associate professor of college student development.<\/p><p>Ng said he allows anything to be written on his site, so long as it doesn't involve pedophilia or underage sex. He does, however, write about how difficult it is to effectively negotiate with a \"half or sometimes fully naked teenage girl\" when she's \"expertly gyrating\" on a man's lap.<\/p><p>While his critics have been speaking out since fall, Ng said he has yet to hear from a student who expressed discomfort about his website.<\/p><p>\"The job of the university is to expose students to the world \u2013 not just a politically correct view of the world and not just the good parts of the world,\" he said. \"If a student reads that [site], I personally think it's good for them. They learn about something out there; maybe they disapprove of it and they don't think it's good.\"<\/p><p>You share in the USA TODAY community, so please keep your comments smart and civil.

It's been nearly two decades since pictures of this sort were produced with any regularity by the studio system, and a lot longer since they were stateside successes. Many of the attempts in recent years have been, at best, mid-budget passion projects with circumscribed audiences (Stallone's own<\/p><p>which topped out at $42 million domestically) or post-modern winks (the French-language \"JCVD\" from 2008, a hostage movie in which Jean-Claude Van Damme plays a version of himself). The few large-scale attempts, like \"The A-Team,\" underperformed. (The biceps-and-bullets remake grossed $77 million domestically, a number that will likely be easily surpassed by \"The Expendables.\")<\/p><p>But the Stallone picture -- with its hard-charging, take-no-prisoners patriotism unbothered by the vagaries of the real world (it takes place in a fictional country, for starters) and its caricature of freedom-hating enemies (\"We will kill this American disease,\" as the TV spot enticed us) -- planted itself squarely in the old-school genre. And this weekend, the movie showed that there's life in that category yet. That \"Scott Pilgrim vs. the World,\" the tongue-in-cheek, pop-culture-referential, decidedly 2010 creation -- the one for, of and by arch fanboys -- trailed well behind \"The Expendables\" only drove home the point more loudly.<\/p><p>On one hand, it's understandable that a movie of easy American heroism (OK, first-world Western heroism) would catch on. In fact, it's surprising it didn't happen sooner. Apple-pie-patriotism already is behind the success of a cable news network and supports large sections of the contemporary country music industry. Why not a film hit too?<\/p><p>But among all the factors to which one might point in explaining the success of \"The Expendables\" -- a cast harvested from so many demographics and eras; a moviegoer backlash to 3-D and CG effects -- it somehow doesn't feel that the demand for neat heroes and villains is one of them.<\/p><p>Norris and his ilk would submit that in our current period of ideological and geopolitical upheaval, in a time of blurry lines between enemies and friends in places such as Afghanistan and Iraq, that black-and-white heroes slake a patriotic thirst (and that, indeed, the movie-going world can support a lot more of them). But history argues the opposite: Those movies succeed when the culture at large is filled with clear-cut distinctions. On the other hand, when the zeitgeist is more cloudy, an entirely different kind of cinema prospers.<\/p><p>The post-WWII era and its mainly straightforward distinctions between good and evil, to take an example of the former, yielded a flowering subgenre of movies with morally uncomplicated gunslingers. And 30 years later, the ideological simplicity of the Cold War and its larger-than-life Evil Empire gave rise to the very action movies on which \"Expendables\" is modeled (not to mention the ultimate in us-versus-them confections, \"Rocky IV.\" Yes, there's a Stallone-ishness to all of this). There are plenty of reasons why these types of movies faded from view in the 1990s, but the fall of the Berlin Wall and the the Soviet Union certainly played a part.<\/p><p>The examples are just as abundant on the other side. The ambiguities of the Vietnam War and the counterculture in the late 1960s and early 1970s undoubtedly offered up the moral murkiness of<\/p><p>\"Midnight Cowboy\" and scores of others. In the post-9\/11 world, meanwhile, movies like<\/p><p>-- with its themes of a destruction-bent enemy that can't be bargained with, and the question of what constitutes an acceptable ethical compromise in fighting that enemy -- have captured our imagination. You can throw<\/p><p>in there too, to the degree the movie was a contemplation of Western interests in the Middle East.<\/p><p>Political eras are, of course, rarely just one thing or another, and the movies we want to see in a given period are hardly monolithic. But as tempting as it is to infer that the success of \"The Expendables\" shows a deeper cultural need, it may well be the wrong inference. When times are confusing, we want movies to reflect that confusion, and even to make sense of it. But we probably don't want to pretend that confusion doesn't exist.<\/p><p>Photo: A scene from \"The Expendables.\" Credit: Lionsgate<\/p><p>Stallone: I'm contemplating an \"Expendables\" sequel<\/p><p>Hollywood wonders if Schwarzenegger will be back","258":"Tim Burrack, a northern Iowa farmer in his 44th growing season, has taken to keeping a wary eye out for unfamiliar vehicles around his 300 acres of genetically modified corn seeds.<\/p><p>Along with other farmers in this vast agricultural region, he has upped his vigilance ever since Mo Hailong and six other Chinese nationals were accused by U.S. authorities in 2013 of digging up seeds from Iowa farms and planning to send them back to China.<\/p><p>The case, in which Mo pleaded guilty in January, has laid bare the value\u2014and vulnerability\u2014of advanced food technology in a world with 7 billion mouths to feed, 1.36 billion of them Chinese.<\/p><p>Citing that case and others as evidence of a growing economic and national security threat to America's farm sector, U.S. law enforcement officials are urging agriculture executives and security officers to increase their vigilance and report any suspicious activity.<\/p><p>But on a March 30 visit to Iowa, Justice Department officials could offer little advice to ensure against similar thefts, underlining how agricultural technology lying in open fields can be more vulnerable than a computer network or a factory floor.<\/p><p>\"It may range down to traditional barriers like a fence and doing human patrols to making sure you get good visuals on what's occurring,\" Assistant Attorney General John Carlin, head of the Justice Department's national security division, said when touring Iowa State University.<\/p><p>But agriculture sector executives say fences and guards are not feasible, due to the high cost and impracticality of guarding hundreds of thousands of acres.<\/p><p>Tom McBride, intellectual property attorney at Monsanto\u2014one of the firms whose seeds were targeted by Mo\u2014said it safeguards its genetically modified organism (GMO) technology by protecting its computers, patenting seeds and keeping fields like Burrack's unmarked.

Small businesses and families starving for credit will eventually get relief as the funding props up banks and they increase lending, but Rajoy didn't offer guidance on when.<\/p><p>Spain on Saturday became the fourth \u2014 and largest \u2014 of the 17 countries that use Europe's common currency to request a bailout \u2014 a big blow to a nation that a few years ago took pride as the continent's economic superstar only to see it become the hot spot in the eurozone debt crisis. Its economy is the eurozone's fourth largest after Germany, France and Italy.<\/p><p>Across the country, Spaniards reacted with a mixture of anger and relief to the news. The amount of the rescue fund, if all is tapped, amounts to \u20ac21,000 of new debt for each person in the nation of 47 million where the average annual salary for those with work is about the same amount and the unemployment rate for those under age 25 is 52 percent.<\/p><p>The country is already reeling from deep austerity cuts Rajoy has imposed over the last six months that have raised taxes, made it easier to hire and fire workers, and cut deep into cherished government programs including education and national health care.<\/p><p>\"It's obviously a shame,\" said civil servant Luisa Saraguren, 44, as she strolled on a sunny Sunday morning with her young daughter. \"But this bailout was fully predictable, and the consequences of this help are going to be a lot bigger compared to the cuts we've been living with already.\"<\/p><p>Rajoy took pains to avoid the word bailout Sunday, saying Spain's rescue package is a line of credit that its most troubled banks will be able to tap. The assistance will not come with the outside control over government macroeconomic policy like that imposed Greece, Ireland and Portugal when their public finances were bailed out.<\/p><p>He said interest rates on the loans will be considerably lower than the rate near 7 percent that Spain has been forced to pay recently on the international debt markets, a level that forced the other countries to seek bailouts.<\/p><p>Spain will regain the economic credibility it has lost by shoring up its banks, which will result in credit being restored so businesses and individuals shut off from loans can start borrowing and the economy will grow again, Rajoy insisted, again without saying when.<\/p><p>Europe's widening recession and financial crisis has hurt companies and investors around the world. Providing a financial lifeline to Spanish banks is likely to relieve anxiety on the Spanish economy \u2014 which is five times larger than Greece's \u2014 and on markets concerned about the country's ability to pay its way.<\/p><p>Spain's financial problems are not due to Greek-style government over-spending. The country's banks particularly its savings banks or \"cajas,\" got caught up in the collapse of a real estate bubble in 2008 that got worse over the past four years. However, as Spain's leaders have struggled for a solution to their banking crisis, the country's borrowing costs have soared close to the level that forced the governments of Greece, Portugal and Ireland to seek rescues.<\/p><p>Some of Spain's banks are struggling with by toxic real estate loans and assets amid fears the problem will get worse as more jobless people can't pay their mortgages. The Bank of Spain says the toxic loans and assets total around \u20ac180 billion. Nationalized lender Bankia SA, which has requested \u20ac19 billion in aid, has \u20ac32 billion in toxic assets. Around four other banks serving the domestic market are considered prime candidates for bailouts.<\/p><p>\"I could never get my mind round the scale of consumption in Spain over the past 20 years, having known it in the 1960s when it was still extremely poor,\" said Paul Preston, a history professor and expert on Spain with the London School of Economics. \"Lots of people enjoyed the consumer boom, but not everybody. Now everybody's having to pay for it.\"<\/p><p>Rajoy blamed Spain's woes on the previous Socialist administration of Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero without mentioning him or his government by name. Zapatero was ousted by Rajoy in a landslide last November by voters outraged over the Socialist handling of the economy.<\/p><p>\"Last year Spain's public administration spent \u20ac90 billion more than it took in, this can't be maintained, we can't live like that,\" Rajoy said.<\/p><p>But Socialist Party leader Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba said Rajoy should acknowledge that Spain is now in bailout territory.<\/p><p>\"The government is trying to make us believe that we've won the lottery, that the Three Kings of Orient have arrived, and that isn't so,\" Rubalcaba said.<\/p><p>After his press conference, Rajoy defended his decision to jet off an hour later to Poland to see Spain's famed national football team take on Italy in the Euro 2012 competition. He said he would be on the ground in Gdansk only for the game before flying back to Madrid Sunday night.<\/p><p>\"I'll be there two and a half hours and then I'll leave,\" Rajoy said. \"I think the national team deserves it.\"","260":"WASHINGTON \u2014 President Obama is pressing United Nations nuclear inspectors to release classified intelligence information showing that Iran is designing and experimenting with nuclear weapons technology. The president's push is part of a larger American effort to further isolate and increase pressure on Iran after accusing it of a plot to assassinate Saudi Arabia's ambassador to the United States.<\/p><p>If the United Nations' watchdog group agrees to publicize the evidence, including new data from recent months, it would almost certainly revive a debate that has been dormant during the Arab Spring about how aggressively the United States and its allies, including Israel, should move to halt Iran's suspected weapons program.<\/p><p>Over the longer term, several senior Obama administration officials said in interviews, they are mulling a ban on financial transactions with Iran's central bank \u2014 a move that has been opposed by China and other Asian nations. Also being considered is an expansion of the ban on the purchase of petroleum products sold by companies controlled by the country's elite military force, the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps.<\/p><p>The Revolutionary Guards are also believed to oversee the military side of the nuclear program, and they are the parent of the Quds Force, which Washington has accused of directing the assassination plot.<\/p><p>The proposed sanctions come as administration officials confront skepticism around the world about their allegations that Iran was behind the plot and limited options about what they can do \u2014 as well as growing pressure from Republicans and some Democrats in Congress to take tougher action against Iran, with the central bank and the oil industry high on lawmakers' lists.<\/p><p>All of the proposed sanctions carry with them considerable political and economic risks. Yukiya Amano, the cautious director general of the United Nations group, the International Atomic Energy Agency, talked publicly in September about publishing some of the most delicate data suggesting Iran worked on nuclear triggers and warheads. But officials who have spoken with him say he is concerned that his inspectors could be ejected from Iran, shutting the best, though narrow, window into its nuclear activities.<\/p><p>Similarly, China and Russia, among other major Iranian trading partners, have resisted further oil and financial sanctions, saying the goal of isolating Iran is a poor strategy. Even inside the Obama administration, some officials say they fear any crackdown on Iranian oil exports could drive up oil prices when the United States and European economies are weak. As one senior official put it, \"You don't want to tip the U.S. into a downturn just to punish the Iranians.\"<\/p><p>Senior administration officials, who would not speak publicly about internal negotiations over the sanctions, say no recommendation on acting against the central bank has gone to Mr. Obama, who vowed last week to make sure Iran would face the \"toughest sanctions\" for what he said was its role in the sensational scheme to hire a Mexican drug cartel to kill the Saudi envoy.<\/p><p>The decision to press the International Atomic Energy Agency was brewing even before the plot against the Saudi ambassador was discovered, but that discovery prompted the White House to pursue a full-court, public press of the agency to release the sensitive intelligence.<\/p><p>Officials familiar with the evidence say it creates extraordinarily uncomfortable questions for the Iranians to answer, but does not definitively point to the construction of a weapon. Instead, it details work on individual technologies essential for designing and detonating a nuclear device, including how to turn uranium into bomb fuel, how to cast conventional explosives in a shape that can set off a nuclear blast, and how to make detonators, generate neutrons to spur a chain reaction, measure detonation waves and make nose cones for missiles.<\/p><p>Tommy Vietor, the spokesman for the National Security Council, said Saturday that \"the United States believes that a comprehensive assessment would be invaluable for the international community in its consideration of Iran's nuclear program and what to do about it.\" Iran has declared that all of the documents suggesting work on how to create a weapon that could fit atop an Iranian missile are \"fabrications\" intended to justify an attack. The country has been the target of covert attacks, including the assassinations of some nuclear scientists and a computer worm that disabled some of Iran's nuclear centrifuges.<\/p><p>The Obama administration, since coming to office, has never publicly presented detailed evidence to back up its claim that Iran is driving toward a weapon or creating the technology to assemble one quickly, should it need it. But it has discussed the evidence widely with allies.<\/p><p>In part the administration has hesitated to discuss the evidence because, after the failure to find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq in 2003, any American evidence is considered suspect. Widespread questions about the plot against the Saudis last week underscored how deep those suspicions run.<\/p><p>But Iran is a different kind of case. Inspectors visit regularly, measuring Iran's output of uranium, including recent production of the material, enriched to 20 percent purity, that takes it far closer to the kind of fuel needed for a weapon. Iran said recently that it would produce more of the 20 percent enriched material than it needs for a small medical research reactor, which prompted new concerns that it is building a stockpile that could be converted to weapons use.","261":"A worker sets up a polling station the morning of the GOP primary in Florida. Fewer voters than expected turned out.<\/p><p>Editor's note: John Avlon is a CNN contributor and senior political columnist for Newsweek and The Daily Beast. He is co-editor of the book \"Deadline Artists: America's Greatest Newspaper Columns.\"<\/p><p>(CNN) -- Beneath Rick Santorum's stunning three-state sweep on Tuesday stands another stubborn sign of dissatisfaction with the status quo: Republican turnout is down.<\/p><p>I'm talking embarrassingly, disturbingly, hey-don't-you-know-it's-an-election-year bad. It is a sign of a serious enthusiasm gap among the rank and file, and a particularly bad omen for Mitt Romney and the GOP in the general election.<\/p><p>Here's the tale of the tape, state by state, beginning with Tuesday night: Minnesota had just more than 47,000 people turn out for its caucuses this year -- four years ago it was nearly 63,000 -- and Romney came in first, not a distant third as he did Tuesday night. In Colorado, more than 70,000 people turned out for its caucus in 2008 -- but in 2012 it was 65,000. And Missouri -- even making a generous discount for the fact that this was an entirely symbolic contest -- had 232,000 people turn out, less than half the number who did four years ago.<\/p><p>Even with months of pre-primary hype and attention solely devoted to the Republican field, turnout in this election cycle essentially flat-lined. In Iowa, a little more than 121,000 people voted, compared with nearly 119,000 four years before, when action in the Democratic caucuses absorbed most of the attention.<\/p><p>In New Hampshire, the same dynamic applied -- 245,000 voters turned out in 2012, compared with 241,000 four years before, despite Republicans being the only game in town and independents making up 47% of the total turnout in 2012, according to CNN exit polls. Take out the independent voters and you've got a deep net decline.<\/p><p>Always proudly rebellious, South Carolina has been the great outlier in this election cycle. With Newt Gingrich making an all-out push for conservatives in a conservative state, turnout was up almost 150,000 over four years before.<\/p><p>But in Florida, the decline became unmistakable. Maybe it decreased because the Romney and Gingrich campaigns, plus super PACS, spent more than $18 million in the Sunshine State on TV ads, of which 93% were negative in the last week alone, according to the Campaign Media Analysis Group. After all, negative ads depress turnout. But after all the mud was thrown, 1.6 million people turned out in the nation's fourth largest state, which might sound impressive until you compare it with the nearly 2 million who turned out in 2008.<\/p><p>Nevada was even worse, with 32,894 people turning out to vote in a state with more than 465,000 registered Republicans. Four years before, more than 44,300 participated in the caucus. Turnout was down more than 25% despite the GOP caucuses being the only game in town. Party officials were expecting a turnout of more than 70,000.<\/p><p>All this should be a wake-up call for the GOP. Despite an enormous amount of national media attention devoted to each of the states to date, the response has been a notable yawn among the Republican rank and file.<\/p><p>The turnout numbers are even worse when you compare them with the number of registered Republicans in each state that has voted to date.<\/p><p>The caucuses in particular bring out an unrepresentative sample of a state's Republican Party. For all the grass-roots romanticism, there has got to be a better way to pick a presidential nominee.<\/p><p>But the news is worst for Romney, long the presumptive front-runner in a party that tends to reward the man next in line.<\/p><p>\"Reluctantly Romney\" could be a bumper sticker, even for his supporters. The former Massachusetts governor has found it difficult to climb above 35% in national polls, meaning that a majority of Republicans still support someone else in a notably weak field.

When the shoebox-shaped and nearly shoebox-size panini shop opened on Bedford Street 15 years ago, there was nothing quite like it in New York, a restaurant that kept things simple and kept prices low, serving flavorful food in a room that was just adorable enough that you could decide, midmeal, that maybe the two of you squeezed into the counter were there on a date, and not just grabbing a bite.<\/p><p>You have to fire up the Wayback Machine to better understand how 'ino helped change how this city eats. Fifteen years ago, New York was a bistro town. There was the old guard: Blue Ribbon, Le Gamin, Jules, Lucky Strike, Raoul's and a dozen others. Then in 1997, a newcomer opened in SoHo named Balthazar, which raised the stakes with its set direction and unlisted reservation line. Balthazar was white-hot: it had perfectly distressed mirrors, fresh and crusty bread, and although it was impossible to get a table unless you knew somebody who knew somebody, you could always go at midnight and eat at the bar.<\/p><p>Soon, New York was lousy with bistros. It was a good era if you wanted a kir, steak frites, escargot, fris\u00e9e lardon, profiteroles. Authenticity, or some version of it, was the point. Everybody was pressing butter into little ramekins to be served at room temperature, changing the paper covering the tablecloths before serving dessert.<\/p><p>Honestly, it was really fun. The restaurants were lively, intimate, sexy. So what if you could recite the menu before you set foot in the door? But if you were a young chef with a measure of vision and creativity, you were stuck either making onion soup and beet salad with goat cheese. Or you worked on the line executing the vision and creativity of an older chef in Midtown or TriBeCa. Prune hadn't yet opened. Neither had Diner. Brooklyn didn't have much of a food scene outside the restaurant row on Smith Street, which was anchored by Patois, a bistro. If you went to Williamsburg, it was to go to a party or to go dancing, not to eat. This was the landscape when Jason and Jennifer Denton opened 'ino on a quiet street in the West Village. The kitchen in the back was the size of a D.J. booth and used the technology of induction burners, which was novel at the time: it was a paninoteca that looked as if it belonged in New York rather than being shipped, tile by mirrored tile, from Milan.<\/p><p>The culinary vocabulary was Italian, but it wasn't sepia-toned and sentimental. Instead, there was a focus on ingredients at a time when, in New York at least, few people cared. It had simple food done well, and sometimes you encountered flavors that weren't lifted out of the songbook. I still have a 13-year-old memory of sharing a shredded duck sandwich with sweet relish, a combination that is about as authentically Italian as a functioning parliament. You could go to 'ino to get something familiar (prosciutto and cheese will never get old), but you could also try something new.<\/p><p>'Ino was a casual joint with integrity, an easygoing place where you could eat well as long as you didn't mind the wait. Today, we take this combination for granted, and expect all kitchens to put some effort into sourcing and display a little creativity no matter how limited the resources. That we do owes a little bit to 'ino.","264":"\"We don't want people coming back or visiting,\" Nugent said. The town is still in an \"imminent danger of fire,\" with several fires still burning nearby. \"I can see black smoke behind the courthouse,\" she said.<\/p><p>The fire in Presidio County has grown to 80,000 acres with only 10% containment, the Forest Service said early Monday.<\/p><p>That growth, according to fire operations chief Mark Sanford, came after the fire \"made a 12-mile run on Saturday.\" Officials still don't know what caused the fast-moving fire, he said.<\/p><p>Despite the damage, Nugent said things could be much worse. \"Tourism is huge\" in Fort Davis, she said, but none of the tourist structures have been burned. The downtown and the historic fort buildings are unscathed, she said.<\/p><p>The blaze, known as the Rock House fire, is currently the largest fire burning in the United States and is just one of 10 fires burning more than 312,000 acres in Texas.<\/p><p>Another 34 homes have burned in a fire in Midland County that has consumed over 16,500 acres and that the state agency on Sunday described as \"very active\" and not at all contained, officials said.<\/p><p>A Red Cross shelter has been set up at Midland College for those displaced or otherwise affected by this wildfire.<\/p><p>\"(Firefighters) can't outrun it,\" said Alan Craft, a spokesman for the state's Lone Star Incident Management Team.<\/p><p>Another large fire near Swenson has scorched some 103,000 acres in three counties, according to the state Forest Service. Spokeswoman April Saginor said officials believe the Swenson fire has been that large for a couple of days, but were not able to remap it until Monday.<\/p><p>As of Sunday night, the blaze across parts of Stonewall, Knox and King counties was totally uncontained despite the use of air resources, bulldozers, fire engines and other tools and personnel, a statement from the Forest Service said.<\/p><p>Official say this fire was caused by a man cutting a pipe.","265":"The Coworking Resources Series is supported by join.me.

Blacksberg, boboroshi, steveyb","266":"Most people, asked to identify the most universal shift in law enforcement over the past 15 years, would likely think of militarization, calls for community policing, or perhaps the slow decline of \"broken windows\".<\/p><p>But from the turn of the millennium to date, arguably no development has been more widespread in law enforcement than the adoption of so called \"less-lethal\" electric control devices (ECD), which many people know by the name of their most prolific manufacturer: Taser International. The company currently supplies their weapons to 17,800 of the United States' roughly 18,000 law enforcement agencies.<\/p><p>The brand name Taser has become as synonymous with these devices as Kleenex or Xerox have to photocopies and tissues \u2013 a quirk of language known as a \"proprietary eponym\". The word has even become a verb, as people commonly speak of being \"Tased\" or \"Tasered\".<\/p><p>The word Taser, though, didn't start with the company: it's actually a loose acronym of the book Tom Swift and His Electric Rifle. Jack Cover, the inventor of the modern ECD, named his prototype after the YA sci-fi novel he loved, and the very idea for a less-lethal electric gun was largely inspired by the fictional one described in the book.<\/p><p>And while this quirky history is known among some in law enforcement and engineering circles, the innocence with which it's told \u2013 a curious inventor culling inspiration from the literature of his youth \u2013 belies a more sinister truth: the book itself is boldly racist.<\/p><p>Tom Swift and His Electric Rifle, published in New York in 1911 under the pen name Victor Appleton, is typical of the literature of its time: an imperialist adventure tale set against the backdrop of a wild and dark African continent. In it, the protagonist, Tom Swift, develops an electric rifle \u2013 a totally novel idea in 1911 \u2013 and decides to test it in Africa in the hunt for ivory.<\/p><p>Africa, in the context of the book, exists only as a frontier of underexploited resources ripe for the wealth accumulation of white men daring enough to attempt. \"Elephant shooting in Africa! My! With my new electric rifle ... what a fellow couldn't do in the dark continent!\"<\/p><p>\"With the price of ivory soaring,\" says Swift's veteran hunting companion, \"there's a chance for us all to get a lot of money.\"<\/p><p>While this unabashed entrepreneurial imperialism tends to read as a relic of a bygone age, today disproportionately white police departments in places like Ferguson, Missouri, often function similarly as the adventurers sent to do the dangerous work of this kind of wealth generation. Like in the book, black communities are often seen not as dynamic places where people live lives, but as sites for plunder.<\/p><p>Take, for example, the Department of Justice's March report on the prevalence of predatory, revenue-based policing in St Louis County: entire municipalities there, as elsewhere in the US, float their operating budgets and justify their own existence on the racially biased extraction of statutory fees from primarily black residents. This scheme has only begun to decline because of the protests and organizing that defined Ferguson in the wake of Mike Brown's death.<\/p><p>In the book, as in America today, the black people are rendered as either passive, simple and childlike, or animalistic and capable of unimaginable violence. They are described in the book at various points as \"hideous in their savagery, wearing only the loin cloth, and with their kinky hair stuck full of sticks\", and as \"wild, savage and ferocious ... like little red apes\".<\/p><p>Swift and his travel companions quickly determine the blacks, scarcely human, need to be controlled, guided or killed as determined by the more \"civilized\" white outsiders.<\/p><p>Consider then how quickly the black people of Ferguson were rendered something less than fully human in the wake of Mike Brown's killing: an on-duty Ferguson police officer, a former NYPD commissioner and a popular actor all spared no time in invoking the discourse of \"animals\" in reference to black protesters. Near and far, incredulous commentators sought to cast the police as the sole defenders of black communities, and the only thing standing between those communities and self-destruction.<\/p><p>\"White police officers wouldn't be there if you weren't killing each other,\" former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani said on Meet the Press last November. Echoing Swift's rank paternalism, he later added: \"I probably saved more black lives as mayor of New York City than any mayor in the history of this city.\"<\/p><p>In the book, when Swift and his companions proudly use their advanced weapons \u2013 particularly the electric rifle \u2013 to dispatch with an incoming buffalo stampede, they too happily celebrate themselves as saviors.<\/p><p>\"Had it not been for the white men, the native village, which consisted of only frail huts, would have been completely wiped out by the animals,\" the novel reads.<\/p><p>Being named after a racist book doesn't make a company or device racist, any more than a person being named after a racist relative makes them so. A name is just that \u2013 and a Taser on its face is no more racist than the city or state of Washington are, simply for being named after our slaveholding first president.<\/p><p>But as recent campus activism in places such as Harvard and Princeton have demonstrated, there is real value in coming to terms with the bigotry embedded in the seemingly innocuous names and symbols of even our most ordinary, and aspirationally colorblind, institutions.<\/p><p>Being aware of the history of the word Taser should make us pause and consider that, every day, predominantly white police officers walk into predominantly black communities armed with weapons first imagined in a book in which \"civilized\" whites entered the black wilds for the purpose of plunder, only to cast themselves as the saviors of the natives. It isn't meaningless that today that sequence sometimes appears to persist in reverse.","267":"A worker sets up a polling station the morning of the GOP primary in Florida. Fewer voters than expected turned out.<\/p><p>Editor's note: John Avlon is a CNN contributor and senior political columnist for Newsweek and The Daily Beast. He is co-editor of the book \"Deadline Artists: America's Greatest Newspaper Columns.\"<\/p><p>(CNN) -- Beneath Rick Santorum's stunning three-state sweep on Tuesday stands another stubborn sign of dissatisfaction with the status quo: Republican turnout is down.<\/p><p>I'm talking embarrassingly, disturbingly, hey-don't-you-know-it's-an-election-year bad. It is a sign of a serious enthusiasm gap among the rank and file, and a particularly bad omen for Mitt Romney and the GOP in the general election.<\/p><p>Here's the tale of the tape, state by state, beginning with Tuesday night: Minnesota had just more than 47,000 people turn out for its caucuses this year -- four years ago it was nearly 63,000 -- and Romney came in first, not a distant third as he did Tuesday night. In Colorado, more than 70,000 people turned out for its caucus in 2008 -- but in 2012 it was 65,000. And Missouri -- even making a generous discount for the fact that this was an entirely symbolic contest -- had 232,000 people turn out, less than half the number who did four years ago.<\/p><p>Even with months of pre-primary hype and attention solely devoted to the Republican field, turnout in this election cycle essentially flat-lined. In Iowa, a little more than 121,000 people voted, compared with nearly 119,000 four years before, when action in the Democratic caucuses absorbed most of the attention.<\/p><p>In New Hampshire, the same dynamic applied -- 245,000 voters turned out in 2012, compared with 241,000 four years before, despite Republicans being the only game in town and independents making up 47% of the total turnout in 2012, according to CNN exit polls. Take out the independent voters and you've got a deep net decline.<\/p><p>Always proudly rebellious, South Carolina has been the great outlier in this election cycle. With Newt Gingrich making an all-out push for conservatives in a conservative state, turnout was up almost 150,000 over four years before.<\/p><p>But in Florida, the decline became unmistakable. Maybe it decreased because the Romney and Gingrich campaigns, plus super PACS, spent more than $18 million in the Sunshine State on TV ads, of which 93% were negative in the last week alone, according to the Campaign Media Analysis Group. After all, negative ads depress turnout. But after all the mud was thrown, 1.6 million people turned out in the nation's fourth largest state, which might sound impressive until you compare it with the nearly 2 million who turned out in 2008.<\/p><p>Nevada was even worse, with 32,894 people turning out to vote in a state with more than 465,000 registered Republicans. Four years before, more than 44,300 participated in the caucus. Turnout was down more than 25% despite the GOP caucuses being the only game in town. Party officials were expecting a turnout of more than 70,000.<\/p><p>All this should be a wake-up call for the GOP. Despite an enormous amount of national media attention devoted to each of the states to date, the response has been a notable yawn among the Republican rank and file.<\/p><p>The turnout numbers are even worse when you compare them with the number of registered Republicans in each state that has voted to date.<\/p><p>The caucuses in particular bring out an unrepresentative sample of a state's Republican Party. For all the grass-roots romanticism, there has got to be a better way to pick a presidential nominee.<\/p><p>But the news is worst for Romney, long the presumptive front-runner in a party that tends to reward the man next in line.<\/p><p>\"Reluctantly Romney\" could be a bumper sticker, even for his supporters. The former Massachusetts governor has found it difficult to climb above 35% in national polls, meaning that a majority of Republicans still support someone else in a notably weak field. His vote margins and totals lag behind those of four years before, when he lost the nomination to John McCain in a crowded and comparatively competent field, although Minnesota is the first state he won in '08 and lost in 2012.<\/p><p>You reap what you sow, and part of the reason turnout is down is directly related to the problem of polarization. The Republican Party is more ideologically polarized than at any time in recent history. Therefore, it put up more purely right-wing candidates than it did four years before, when center-right leaders such as McCain and Rudy Giuliani were also in the race. A bigger tent inspired bigger turnout.<\/p><p>But the other reason is simple dissatisfaction with the candidates.<\/p><p>Republicans seem united in their anger against the president -- like the Democrats in 2004 -- but they are uninspired by their options. Draft movements for fantasy candidates ranging from Chris Christie to Mitch Daniels to Paul Ryan and even Jeb Bush have started and failed. Some party leaders show more enthusiasm for a hypothetical 2016 crop of candidates, including Marco Rubio and Bobby Jindal, than they do for the flawed choices before them in this election. Divided and dispirited is an odd place for the Republican Party to be so soon after the enthusiasms of the 2010 tea party-driven election.<\/p><p>The bottom line is that voter turnout matters. And what should be most troubling for Republicans is that this enthusiasm gap among the conservative base is accompanied by a lack of candidates who might appeal to independents and centrist swing voters in the general election. It is a double barrel of bad news for the Republican Party.

Because the first one was long before we put the majority of fossil carbon into the atmosphere, Newt can say\u2014with scientific authority\u2014that the magnitude of 'natural' climate change is likely to be at least as large as what humans have done.<\/p><p>Then Newt should proceed to the future. It's not the heat, it's the sensitivity. How much it will warm in the future is a function of how sensitive the atmosphere is to doubling atmospheric carbon dioxide. There are a number of independent arguments now coming together showing that this value may have been overestimated. The reference for the most recent is a November issue of Science.<\/p><p>Next, a little refreshing honesty: in 2009, the House of Representatives passed a cap-and-trade bill (which the Senate did not) commanding that the average american\u201438 years from now\u2014be allowed the carbon dioxide emissions of the average citizen in 1867. Prior to its passage, Newt was undeniably for such a system. Newt could call that that the \"second dumbest thing\" he has done and be finished with it.<\/p><p>After setting the record straight, how about interjecting his own political philosophy? When asked what to do about global warming, he should give the honest answer: if the atmosphere indeed is not as sensitive to carbon dioxide changes as previously thought, the correct response is nothing.<\/p><p>That's because \"nothing\" really means something. Newt should channel his historian. When markets are free, capital supports innovation more efficiently than when they aren't. Think about the remarkable changes in energy and technology in the last 100 years. Isn't it rather obvious that the same will occur in the next century, if only we don't hinder capital development? Newt might even use the catchy saw (first sloganed by Northern Illinois Gas in 1972) the future belongs to the efficient, and that there are impressive market forces that advantage those who produce things efficiently or produce efficient things.<\/p><p>When the doomsayers say Newt is believing in a Deus ex machine to dramatically cut carbon dioxide emissions, he might point out that those were the same folks who, only a very few years ago, told us we were running out of natural gas. Innovation and capital revolutionized drilling and fracturing shale, and we now know we have literally hundreds of years of it under our feet. There are a lot more voters and delegates around the country who will benefit from the shale revolution than there are in ethanol-addicted Iowa.","269":"Most people, asked to identify the most universal shift in law enforcement over the past 15 years, would likely think of militarization, calls for community policing, or perhaps the slow decline of \"broken windows\".<\/p><p>But from the turn of the millennium to date, arguably no development has been more widespread in law enforcement than the adoption of so called \"less-lethal\" electric control devices (ECD), which many people know by the name of their most prolific manufacturer: Taser International. The company currently supplies their weapons to 17,800 of the United States' roughly 18,000 law enforcement agencies.<\/p><p>The brand name Taser has become as synonymous with these devices as Kleenex or Xerox have to photocopies and tissues \u2013 a quirk of language known as a \"proprietary eponym\". The word has even become a verb, as people commonly speak of being \"Tased\" or \"Tasered\".<\/p><p>The word Taser, though, didn't start with the company: it's actually a loose acronym of the book Tom Swift and His Electric Rifle. Jack Cover, the inventor of the modern ECD, named his prototype after the YA sci-fi novel he loved, and the very idea for a less-lethal electric gun was largely inspired by the fictional one described in the book.<\/p><p>And while this quirky history is known among some in law enforcement and engineering circles, the innocence with which it's told \u2013 a curious inventor culling inspiration from the literature of his youth \u2013 belies a more sinister truth: the book itself is boldly racist.<\/p><p>Tom Swift and His Electric Rifle, published in New York in 1911 under the pen name Victor Appleton, is typical of the literature of its time: an imperialist adventure tale set against the backdrop of a wild and dark African continent. In it, the protagonist, Tom Swift, develops an electric rifle \u2013 a totally novel idea in 1911 \u2013 and decides to test it in Africa in the hunt for ivory.<\/p><p>Africa, in the context of the book, exists only as a frontier of underexploited resources ripe for the wealth accumulation of white men daring enough to attempt. \"Elephant shooting in Africa! My! With my new electric rifle ... what a fellow couldn't do in the dark continent!\"<\/p><p>\"With the price of ivory soaring,\" says Swift's veteran hunting companion, \"there's a chance for us all to get a lot of money.\"<\/p><p>While this unabashed entrepreneurial imperialism tends to read as a relic of a bygone age, today disproportionately white police departments in places like Ferguson, Missouri, often function similarly as the adventurers sent to do the dangerous work of this kind of wealth generation. Like in the book, black communities are often seen not as dynamic places where people live lives, but as sites for plunder.<\/p><p>Take, for example, the Department of Justice's March report on the prevalence of predatory, revenue-based policing in St Louis County: entire municipalities there, as elsewhere in the US, float their operating budgets and justify their own existence on the racially biased extraction of statutory fees from primarily black residents. This scheme has only begun to decline because of the protests and organizing that defined Ferguson in the wake of Mike Brown's death.<\/p><p>In the book, as in America today, the black people are rendered as either passive, simple and childlike, or animalistic and capable of unimaginable violence. They are described in the book at various points as \"hideous in their savagery, wearing only the loin cloth, and with their kinky hair stuck full of sticks\", and as \"wild, savage and ferocious ... like little red apes\".<\/p><p>Swift and his travel companions quickly determine the blacks, scarcely human, need to be controlled, guided or killed as determined by the more \"civilized\" white outsiders.<\/p><p>Consider then how quickly the black people of Ferguson were rendered something less than fully human in the wake of Mike Brown's killing: an on-duty Ferguson police officer, a former NYPD commissioner and a popular actor all spared no time in invoking the discourse of \"animals\" in reference to black protesters. Near and far, incredulous commentators sought to cast the police as the sole defenders of black communities, and the only thing standing between those communities and self-destruction.<\/p><p>\"White police officers wouldn't be there if you weren't killing each other,\" former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani said on Meet the Press last November. Echoing Swift's rank paternalism, he later added: \"I probably saved more black lives as mayor of New York City than any mayor in the history of this city.\"<\/p><p>In the book, when Swift and his companions proudly use their advanced weapons \u2013 particularly the electric rifle \u2013 to dispatch with an incoming buffalo stampede, they too happily celebrate themselves as saviors.<\/p><p>\"Had it not been for the white men, the native village, which consisted of only frail huts, would have been completely wiped out by the animals,\" the novel reads.<\/p><p>Being named after a racist book doesn't make a company or device racist, any more than a person being named after a racist relative makes them so. A name is just that \u2013 and a Taser on its face is no more racist than the city or state of Washington are, simply for being named after our slaveholding first president.<\/p><p>But as recent campus activism in places such as Harvard and Princeton have demonstrated, there is real value in coming to terms with the bigotry embedded in the seemingly innocuous names and symbols of even our most ordinary, and aspirationally colorblind, institutions.<\/p><p>Being aware of the history of the word Taser should make us pause and consider that, every day, predominantly white police officers walk into predominantly black communities armed with weapons first imagined in a book in which \"civilized\" whites entered the black wilds for the purpose of plunder, only to cast themselves as the saviors of the natives. It isn't meaningless that today that sequence sometimes appears to persist in reverse.","270":"Jacksonville, Ark., police arrested reality TV stars Joshua Rendon and Ebony Jackson-Rendon this week after police found their filthy home contained drug paraphernalia and synthetic marijuana. The state took custody of the couple's young child.<\/p><p>The 19-year-olds, who currently live at the Little Rock Air Force base, appeared on the first season of MTV's \"16 and Pregnant\" in a plot line that included Joshua Rendon enlisting in the Air Force.<\/p><p>Mug shots of Ebony Jackson-Rendon and Joshua Rendon provided by Jacksonville, Ark., Police Department.<\/p><p>When the police executed a search warrant of the Rendons' home Tuesday, detectives described its condition as \"deplorable.

Beginning with its shot of a Pontiac GTO pulling doughnuts in a high school parking lot to Aerosmith's \"Sweet Emotion,\" \"Dazed\" is such a humane approximation of what it was like to come of age in the mid-1970s that one wishes it would never end. On the evidence of \"Boyhood\" and the \"Before Sunrise\" trilogy, though, Linklater doesn't want any of his movies to end. Thus \"Everybody Wants Some!!\"<\/p><p>Which at first is different, sometimes jarringly so, before wading into the open-armed embrace of experience that marks this filmmaker's finest work. The tipoffs are those double exclamation points and an onscreen title font that recalls a Skinemax late-night movie circa 1981. What if you took one of that era's hormone-drenched stu-coms and put real people in it?<\/p><p>The year is 1980, actually, and Jake (Blake Jenner from \"Glee\") is arriving for his freshman year at (the fictional) Southeastern Texas State University. A high school pitching star and rangy college prospect, he's assigned an off-campus baseball dorm with the other players. It's a ready-made animal house, with rules laid down by a briefly seen coach (Jonathan Breck) that are immediately ignored. Occasionally we'll get an onscreen reminder of how many dwindling days and hours remain before classes begin. These, too, are ignored.<\/p><p>Instead, Linklater parks his cameras to observe, with indulgence and much good humor, the bonding rituals of young men who only think they have it figured out. Jake's housemates fall into general categories that re-sort themselves into individual personalities: The motor-mouthed ladies' man Finnegan (Glen Powell), the Zen surfer-stoner Willoughby (Wyatt Russell), uber-competitive McReynolds (Tyler Hoechlin), country rube Billy (Will Brittain), smartass Nesbit (Austin Amelio), na\u00efve Brumley (Tanner Kalina). And so on.<\/p><p>A few stand slightly outside the pack: the over-confident psycho-nerd pitcher Jay Niles (Juston Street, freakily funny) and the laconic second base star Dale Douglas (J. Quinton Johnson), whose blackness is rarely commented on. Where are the women? There to be chased and partied with and seduced. \"This is college, Jake,\" the hero is told early on. \"The girls can be as big sluts as the guys.\"<\/p><p>Oh, dear. Is \"Everybody Wants Some!!\" what happens when you people an entire Richard Linklater movie with Matthew McConaughey's horndog Wooderson from \"Dazed and Confused\"? Yes and no, or, rather, yes, but only at first. As the boys sprawl through the last days of summer, the swagger that borders on smug begins to mellow and melt away. Searching for good times and girls, they hop from a disco one night to a country and western bar the next to a punk mosh pit to an art-student costume party, minds open, adapting, ever-changing. After a while, the hero starts having a smallish identity crisis, confessing that \"it sort of begs the question of who we are.\"<\/p><p>Well, yes. This is college, Jake. Even a high school sports star can be anyone he wants.<\/p><p>The movie eventually spins him off from the crowd into the arms of Beverly (Zoey Deutch), a tartly ardent stage arts freshman with Joni Mitchell posters on her wall. She's unpretentious for a theater brat, he's smart and soulful for a jock, and the two stand dazzled in the Venn diagram overlap of their attraction. These scenes try a little too hard to be charming but they are anyway, and if Deutch has the freckles and immediacy of a classic Brat Pack heroine, it may be because her mother is Lea Thompson of \"Back to the Future\" and \"Some Kind of Wonderful\" and her father is Howard Deutch, who directed the latter.<\/p><p>More second-generation pleasures: Wyatt Russell, who plays the woolly baseball mystic Willoughby, is the son of Kurt Russell and Goldie Hawn, and he has a high old time \u2014 emphasis on high \u2014 explaining to his teammates why \"Fearless,\" from the 1971 album \"Meddle,\" is the best track that Pink Floyd ever recorded. Because he is correct, I am awarding \"Everybody Wants Some!!\" an extra half-star.<\/p><p>Linklater was a high school baseball player who went to Sam Houston State on a scholarship, and the movie is steeped in the lazy, rivalrous minutiae of college ball. Willoughby gets off a moment of bliss when he muses on the pleasures of pitching \u2014 \"It's lovely out there on the bump,\" he says \u2014 and we learn that it's the .230 hitters who are always the most superstitious. Also that it's possible to slice a pitched baseball in half with an ax. At one point, one of the characters gazes with incredulity at a crowd of fellow students and says, \"I know what we're doing here. We're playing baseball. What are they doing here?\"<\/p><p>\"Everybody Wants Some!!\" is a nice long soak in the Proustian detritus of its era. Beverly drives a Gremlin, Jake knows the secret of winning at \"Space Invaders,\" and people can still confidently begin sentences with the words, \"It's like Carl Sagan says. . .\" What \"Sweet Emotion\" was to \"Dazed and Confused,\" so the Knack's \"My Sharona\" is to this movie, and the soundtrack rolls forward from there: glorious junk from the days when Eddie Rabbitt, Eddie Money, Sniff 'n' the Tears, and the BusBoys meant something.<\/p><p>All that's missing is a plot. But Linklater doesn't do plot; he does life. Says Powell's garrulous Finnegan, summing up the art of both this movie and this moviemaker, \"I don't think at all. I just talk a lot. It's jazz improv. You're invited.\" And so are we.<\/p><p>Written and directed by Richard Linklater. Starring Blake Jenner, Zoey Deutch, Glen Powell, Wyatt Russell, Tyler Hoechlin, Juston Street.

Ms. Temple said the longer Mr. Akin waited, the more difficult it would get.<\/p><p>The first deadline for Mr. Akin to have easily withdrawn from the race was Tuesday evening. His decision to stay in the race means that he now has only a few weeks to reconsider before things get even harder.<\/p><p>Certification of the presidential ballots in Missouri will be no later than Sept. 17, and could be shortly after President Obama officially accepts the Democratic nomination on Sept. 5.<\/p><p>Once the ballots are printed, any candidate who seeks to withdraw must pay for the reprinting of new ballots. That could be prohibitively expensive for Mr. Akin, but presumably the Republican Party \u2014 which badly wants him to withdraw \u2014 would cover the cost.<\/p><p>Military overseas ballots begin shipping out Sept. 22. That might be the first firm deadline. But the drop-dead deadline is Sept. 25, when general absentee ballots are sent out.<\/p><p>Mel Carnahan, the former Missouri governor and Ms. Carnahan's father, died on Oct. 16, 2000, during his campaign for the Senate against the Republican incumbent, John Ashcroft. Mr. Carnahan's name nonetheless appeared on the ballot in November \u2014 and he won. (His widow, Jean, was appointed to the seat, and lost it in special election in 2002.)<\/p><p>Assuming that Mr. Akin bows to pressure from Republican leaders (or simply concludes that he isn't able to raise enough money to mount a credible campaign), Missouri law requires that he seek a court order allowing him to drop out of the race.<\/p><p>State officials say that issuing such court orders is routine. Mr. Akin would merely have to file the necessary papers with the court and his name would no longer be printed on the November ballot. Republicans could then quickly nominate someone else to run against Senator Claire McCaskill, the Democratic incumbent.<\/p><p>Democrats would no doubt like to see Mr. Akin \u2014 now politically weakened by his comments on rape and pregnancy \u2014 stay in the race. In theory, the Democratic officials who run the state's election offices could object to Mr. Akin's request for a court order, a move that would force a hearing before a judge.<\/p><p>The relevant statute says someone like Mr. Akin can withdraw \"pursuant to a court order, which, except for good cause shown by the election authority in opposition thereto, shall be freely given upon application by the candidate to the circuit court in the county of such candidate's residence.\"<\/p><p>Election officials say they can find no precedent at all for such an objection in the state's history. But Ms. Carnahan is herself a factor in Republican minds. As the Democratic Senate nominee in 2010, she lost to Representative Roy Blunt, and Republicans imagine she could put up a fight.<\/p><p>\"The secretary's job is to protect the rights of Missouri voters,\" Ms. Temple said when asked whether Ms. Carnahan would fight a court order to remove Mr. Akin's name from the ballot.<\/p><p>A further complication: Under state law, any election authority in Missouri can oppose a withdrawal order, down to the county and city level, and there are Democrats aplenty in Missouri. But Ms. Temple added that right now, it would be up to a Missouri court to determine whether Mr. Akin could withdraw, not the secretary of state.<\/p><p>\"It's completely in the hands of the court to decide the facts,\" she said.<\/p><p>Assuming Mr. Akin does manage to drop out, the state central committee of the Republican Party in Missouri would have to pick a new candidate within 28 days, or by Oct. 12, whichever comes first.","273":"Kenneth Ng calls his website a primer for tourists headed to<\/p><p>, but Fodor's it ain't.<\/p><p>The California State University at Northridge professor's site is a one-stop shop for men drawn to the country's sex tourism industry. Dotted with pictures of scantily clad women, the website, BigBabyKenny, advises would-be Johns on the art of negotiating with prostitutes. \"Start with a compliment,\" Ng advises.<\/p><p>Needless to say, Ng's website is causing headaches for Northridge administrators. First publicized by the Los Angeles Daily News, the economics professor's site has drawn a wave of unwelcome attention, forcing administrators to at once criticize its content and defend Ng's right to publish freely on his own time without university resources.<\/p><p>\"Until we find representative evidence that it infringes upon the work he does at the university itself, there's not much we can do about it,\" said Harold Hellenbrand, Northridge's provost.<\/p><p>There may be subtlety in Hellenbrand's words, but his message is clear: If BigBabyKenny infringes on Ng's ability to effectively do his job, then Northridge's position will change. Ng has already said his site is run through a separate server not connected to the university, but Northridge officials might still make a case that the site has interfered with his job. Asked if students complaining that they were no longer comfortable in Ng's class would compel Northridge to demand the site be taken down, Hellenbrand said \"I'm not inviting complaints, but you just hit on the key issue.\"<\/p><p>\"If [running the site is] what he wants to do, and at the same time he wants to educate students and students flock away, then that would create a problem,\" Hellenbrand said.<\/p><p>How Ng came to be identified as the author of BigBabyKenny is a story in itself. A frequent tourist of Thailand, Ng took to blogging on the website of a Bangkok bar called Big Mango Bar. In one controversial post, Ng advised men to seek women near a particular Buddhist shrine.<\/p><p>\"The naysayers will say its creepy to be hanging around the Muariti Shrine, hitting on the emotionally vulnerable girls desperately praying and paying Buddha for a better love life but I beg to differ. Buddha works in mysterious ways,\" he wrote.<\/p><p>Perturbed by the post, the bar owners removed it. That led Ng to start his own site, prompting what Ng describes as a concerted effort by the owners to publicize his penchant for writing about prostitutes. They sent mass e-mails to faculty listed in Northridge's directory, and also posted on RateMyProfessor.com, warning students about Ng, he said.<\/p><p>Ng readily defends the content of his site and says he has no intention of taking it down.<\/p><p>\"The university has no stake in this one way or the other, and besides, professors can say whatever they want,\" said Ng, a tenured associate professor of economics.<\/p><p>Some question whether Ng has crossed a gray legal line, however, by advising men on sex tourism. Patrick Trueman, a former U.S. justice department official, notes that there are several federal statutes that could come into play. Within U.S. Code 18 are two sections \u2013 2422 (a) and 2422 (b) \u2013 that specifically prohibit anyone from \"enticing or coercing a person\" to travel internationally in pursuit of prostitutes. Moreover, one section specifically prohibits the use of the Internet to lure people.<\/p><p>While prostitution may be tolerated in Thailand, that's immaterial under the federal code, Trueman said.<\/p><p>\"Inducing and enticing? Isn't that what this guy's doing?\" said Trueman, former chief of the Justice Department's Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section in the Criminal Division.<\/p><p>Trueman, now a lawyer specializing in sex trafficking and child abuse cases, said there would likely be debate about whether talking about procuring prostitutes online and actually arranging prostitutes for a person should be treated differently under the law.<\/p><p>\"Given how lax the fed government is on these crimes, they may not charge somebody unless they are more directly involved,\" he said. \"That's not to say this person couldn't be charged, and as I read it they could be charged.\"<\/p><p>Beyond the legal implications, critics have already attacked Ng on moral grounds. John Foubert, an Oklahoma State University professor who researches sex trafficking, argues that women \u2013 often minors \u2013 are forced into the sex tourism industry and often have trouble escaping it. Even if Ng is operating within the bounds of the law, Northridge officials have an ethical problem they've yet to face, Foubert said.<\/p><p>\"Do they want to live with the blood on their hands of these girls that are being essentially raped by these men, who are going down and purchasing sex? I think that's a larger question,\" said Foubert, an associate professor of college student development.<\/p><p>Ng said he allows anything to be written on his site, so long as it doesn't involve pedophilia or underage sex. He does, however, write about how difficult it is to effectively negotiate with a \"half or sometimes fully naked teenage girl\" when she's \"expertly gyrating\" on a man's lap.<\/p><p>While his critics have been speaking out since fall, Ng said he has yet to hear from a student who expressed discomfort about his website.<\/p><p>\"The job of the university is to expose students to the world \u2013 not just a politically correct view of the world and not just the good parts of the world,\" he said. \"If a student reads that [site], I personally think it's good for them. They learn about something out there; maybe they disapprove of it and they don't think it's good.\"<\/p><p>You share in the USA TODAY community, so please keep your comments smart and civil.

When the shoebox-shaped and nearly shoebox-size panini shop opened on Bedford Street 15 years ago, there was nothing quite like it in New York, a restaurant that kept things simple and kept prices low, serving flavorful food in a room that was just adorable enough that you could decide, midmeal, that maybe the two of you squeezed into the counter were there on a date, and not just grabbing a bite.<\/p><p>You have to fire up the Wayback Machine to better understand how 'ino helped change how this city eats. Fifteen years ago, New York was a bistro town. There was the old guard: Blue Ribbon, Le Gamin, Jules, Lucky Strike, Raoul's and a dozen others. Then in 1997, a newcomer opened in SoHo named Balthazar, which raised the stakes with its set direction and unlisted reservation line. Balthazar was white-hot: it had perfectly distressed mirrors, fresh and crusty bread, and although it was impossible to get a table unless you knew somebody who knew somebody, you could always go at midnight and eat at the bar.<\/p><p>Soon, New York was lousy with bistros. It was a good era if you wanted a kir, steak frites, escargot, fris\u00e9e lardon, profiteroles. Authenticity, or some version of it, was the point.

The restaurants were lively, intimate, sexy. So what if you could recite the menu before you set foot in the door?

Or you worked on the line executing the vision and creativity of an older chef in Midtown or TriBeCa. Prune hadn't yet opened. Neither had Diner.

The president's push is part of a larger American effort to further isolate and increase pressure on Iran after accusing it of a plot to assassinate Saudi Arabia's ambassador to the United States.<\/p><p>If the United Nations' watchdog group agrees to publicize the evidence, including new data from recent months, it would almost certainly revive a debate that has been dormant during the Arab Spring about how aggressively the United States and its allies, including Israel, should move to halt Iran's suspected weapons program.<\/p><p>Over the longer term, several senior Obama administration officials said in interviews, they are mulling a ban on financial transactions with Iran's central bank \u2014 a move that has been opposed by China and other Asian nations. Also being considered is an expansion of the ban on the purchase of petroleum products sold by companies controlled by the country's elite military force, the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps.<\/p><p>The Revolutionary Guards are also believed to oversee the military side of the nuclear program, and they are the parent of the Quds Force, which Washington has accused of directing the assassination plot.<\/p><p>The proposed sanctions come as administration officials confront skepticism around the world about their allegations that Iran was behind the plot and limited options about what they can do \u2014 as well as growing pressure from Republicans and some Democrats in Congress to take tougher action against Iran, with the central bank and the oil industry high on lawmakers' lists.<\/p><p>All of the proposed sanctions carry with them considerable political and economic risks. Yukiya Amano, the cautious director general of the United Nations group, the International Atomic Energy Agency, talked publicly in September about publishing some of the most delicate data suggesting Iran worked on nuclear triggers and warheads. But officials who have spoken with him say he is concerned that his inspectors could be ejected from Iran, shutting the best, though narrow, window into its nuclear activities.<\/p><p>Similarly, China and Russia, among other major Iranian trading partners, have resisted further oil and financial sanctions, saying the goal of isolating Iran is a poor strategy. Even inside the Obama administration, some officials say they fear any crackdown on Iranian oil exports could drive up oil prices when the United States and European economies are weak. As one senior official put it, \"You don't want to tip the U.S. into a downturn just to punish the Iranians.\"<\/p><p>Senior administration officials, who would not speak publicly about internal negotiations over the sanctions, say no recommendation on acting against the central bank has gone to Mr. Obama, who vowed last week to make sure Iran would face the \"toughest sanctions\" for what he said was its role in the sensational scheme to hire a Mexican drug cartel to kill the Saudi envoy.<\/p><p>The decision to press the International Atomic Energy Agency was brewing even before the plot against the Saudi ambassador was discovered, but that discovery prompted the White House to pursue a full-court, public press of the agency to release the sensitive intelligence.<\/p><p>Officials familiar with the evidence say it creates extraordinarily uncomfortable questions for the Iranians to answer, but does not definitively point to the construction of a weapon. Instead, it details work on individual technologies essential for designing and detonating a nuclear device, including how to turn uranium into bomb fuel, how to cast conventional explosives in a shape that can set off a nuclear blast, and how to make detonators, generate neutrons to spur a chain reaction, measure detonation waves and make nose cones for missiles.<\/p><p>Tommy Vietor, the spokesman for the National Security Council, said Saturday that \"the United States believes that a comprehensive assessment would be invaluable for the international community in its consideration of Iran's nuclear program and what to do about it.\" Iran has declared that all of the documents suggesting work on how to create a weapon that could fit atop an Iranian missile are \"fabrications\" intended to justify an attack. The country has been the target of covert attacks, including the assassinations of some nuclear scientists and a computer worm that disabled some of Iran's nuclear centrifuges.<\/p><p>The Obama administration, since coming to office, has never publicly presented detailed evidence to back up its claim that Iran is driving toward a weapon or creating the technology to assemble one quickly, should it need it. But it has discussed the evidence widely with allies.<\/p><p>In part the administration has hesitated to discuss the evidence because, after the failure to find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq in 2003, any American evidence is considered suspect. Widespread questions about the plot against the Saudis last week underscored how deep those suspicions run.<\/p><p>But Iran is a different kind of case. Inspectors visit regularly, measuring Iran's output of uranium, including recent production of the material, enriched to 20 percent purity, that takes it far closer to the kind of fuel needed for a weapon. Iran said recently that it would produce more of the 20 percent enriched material than it needs for a small medical research reactor, which prompted new concerns that it is building a stockpile that could be converted to weapons use.","279":"Talk to anyone involved in the action-movie glory days of the 1980s and the first thing they'll say is that it's time to bring those days back. \"In today's world. we need heroes,\" Aaron Norris, brother of Chuck and an important behind-the-scenes figure in that heyday, told us when we interviewed him recently. \"Our action movies have gotten too artsy.\"<\/p><p>Artsy sort of left the room this weekend, when Sylvester Stallone's \"The Expendables,\" which assembled a team of muscle-bound mercenaries to fight indisputably evil (but ideologically harmless) enemies in far-off lands, got audiences excited, to<\/p><p>Until this weekend, old-school action movies -- defined, for argument's sake, as films with a slew of explosions, a shortage of moral ambiguity and a triumph of physical effects over digital ones -- had seen better days. It's been nearly two decades since pictures of this sort were produced with any regularity by the studio system, and a lot longer since they were stateside successes. Many of the attempts in recent years have been, at best, mid-budget passion projects with circumscribed audiences (Stallone's own<\/p><p>which topped out at $42 million domestically) or post-modern winks (the French-language \"JCVD\" from 2008, a hostage movie in which Jean-Claude Van Damme plays a version of himself). The few large-scale attempts, like \"The A-Team,\" underperformed. (The biceps-and-bullets remake grossed $77 million domestically, a number that will likely be easily surpassed by \"The Expendables.\")<\/p><p>But the Stallone picture -- with its hard-charging, take-no-prisoners patriotism unbothered by the vagaries of the real world (it takes place in a fictional country, for starters) and its caricature of freedom-hating enemies (\"We will kill this American disease,\" as the TV spot enticed us) -- planted itself squarely in the old-school genre. And this weekend, the movie showed that there's life in that category yet. That \"Scott Pilgrim vs. the World,\" the tongue-in-cheek, pop-culture-referential, decidedly 2010 creation -- the one for, of and by arch fanboys -- trailed well behind \"The Expendables\" only drove home the point more loudly.<\/p><p>On one hand, it's understandable that a movie of easy American heroism (OK, first-world Western heroism) would catch on. In fact, it's surprising it didn't happen sooner. Apple-pie-patriotism already is behind the success of a cable news network and supports large sections of the contemporary country music industry. Why not a film hit too?<\/p><p>But among all the factors to which one might point in explaining the success of \"The Expendables\" -- a cast harvested from so many demographics and eras; a moviegoer backlash to 3-D and CG effects -- it somehow doesn't feel that the demand for neat heroes and villains is one of them.<\/p><p>Norris and his ilk would submit that in our current period of ideological and geopolitical upheaval, in a time of blurry lines between enemies and friends in places such as Afghanistan and Iraq, that black-and-white heroes slake a patriotic thirst (and that, indeed, the movie-going world can support a lot more of them). But history argues the opposite: Those movies succeed when the culture at large is filled with clear-cut distinctions. On the other hand, when the zeitgeist is more cloudy, an entirely different kind of cinema prospers.<\/p><p>The post-WWII era and its mainly straightforward distinctions between good and evil, to take an example of the former, yielded a flowering subgenre of movies with morally uncomplicated gunslingers. And 30 years later, the ideological simplicity of the Cold War and its larger-than-life Evil Empire gave rise to the very action movies on which \"Expendables\" is modeled (not to mention the ultimate in us-versus-them confections, \"Rocky IV.\" Yes, there's a Stallone-ishness to all of this). There are plenty of reasons why these types of movies faded from view in the 1990s, but the fall of the Berlin Wall and the the Soviet Union certainly played a part.<\/p><p>The examples are just as abundant on the other side. The ambiguities of the Vietnam War and the counterculture in the late 1960s and early 1970s undoubtedly offered up the moral murkiness of<\/p><p>\"Midnight Cowboy\" and scores of others. In the post-9\/11 world, meanwhile, movies like<\/p><p>-- with its themes of a destruction-bent enemy that can't be bargained with, and the question of what constitutes an acceptable ethical compromise in fighting that enemy -- have captured our imagination. You can throw<\/p><p>in there too, to the degree the movie was a contemplation of Western interests in the Middle East.<\/p><p>Political eras are, of course, rarely just one thing or another, and the movies we want to see in a given period are hardly monolithic. But as tempting as it is to infer that the success of \"The Expendables\" shows a deeper cultural need, it may well be the wrong inference. When times are confusing, we want movies to reflect that confusion, and even to make sense of it. But we probably don't want to pretend that confusion doesn't exist.<\/p><p>Photo: A scene from \"The Expendables.\" Credit: Lionsgate<\/p><p>Stallone: I'm contemplating an \"Expendables\" sequel<\/p><p>Hollywood wonders if Schwarzenegger will be back","280":"In a Facebook post on Sunday, 'ino announced that it had closed.

(Sarah Parnass\/The Washington Post)<\/p><p>The House Select Committee on Blumenthal, as some are now calling it, came to order at 10 a.m. Lawmakers didn't finish questioning Hillary Clinton until 11 hours later \u2014 just after the Democratic presidential candidate succumbed to a coughing fit.<\/p><p>In that period of time, the name of Sidney Blumenthal was invoked more than 75 times, and scores of questions were asked about the longtime Clinton friend. By lunchtime, Blumenthal had been invoked 49 times \u2014 exactly the number of mentions of J. Christopher Stevens, the ambassador to Libya whose death in Benghazi is the supposed subject of the congressional probe. The other three Americans slain in Benghazi \u2014 Sean Smith, Glen Doherty, Tyrone Woods \u2014 got seven or eight mentions apiece, then-CIA director David Petraeus and former defense secretary Robert Gates each got two, and then-Defense Secretary Leon Panetta had none.<\/p><p>Dana Milbank writes about political theater in the nation's capital.

Donilon's \"babbling rhetoric,\" and he said Blumenthal had referred to \"Obama\" (he \"left the 'president' part out\") and \"his political cronies in the White House and Chicago.\"<\/p><p>Clinton refused to get riled. \"I don't know what this line of questioning does to help us get to the bottom of deaths of four Americans,\" she said.<\/p><p>But Gowdy knew. A couple of minutes later, he announced: \"I'll tell you what: If you think you've heard about Sidney Blumenthal so far, wait until the next round.\"<\/p><p>He and his colleagues made good on that statement, posing questions on a Blumenthal visit to Clinton's home, about his work for the Clinton Foundation, his business interests, his attempt to get a job at the State Department and his communication with the former secretary of state over matters as mundane as her new iPad. They were particularly concerned with whether Blumenthal's advice to Clinton on Libya was \"unsolicited.\"<\/p><p>The Blumenthal focus shows that, after 17 months of probing Clinton, the Benghazi committee hasn't come up with much. Blumenthal has been a Clinton hatchet man for years, and he has an unsavory reputation. The very mention of his name (he was prominent during the Monica Lewinsky scandal) lends a whiff of skulduggery to any situation.<\/p><p>But injecting Blumenthal as a central character in the Benghazi probe doesn't help Republicans demonstrate that Clinton did wrong. And the justification for invoking him \u2014 to demonstrate that Clinton had more contact with him than with Stevens \u2014 is a stretch. Whatever else one thinks of the former journalist \u2014 I've clashed with him over the years \u2014 he had nothing to do with what happened in Libya on Sept. 11 and 12, 2012.<\/p><p>Rep. Mike Pompeo (R-Kan.) acted as if he had found a video of Blumenthal attacking the compound himself. Pompeo, who had previously made the false allegation that Clinton got \"most of her intelligence\" on Libya from Blumenthal, asked whether Stevens had Clinton's personal e-mail, her cellphone number, fax or home address or visited her at home. \"Mr. Blumenthal had each of those and did each of those things,\" Pompeo concluded.<\/p><p>Rep. Peter J. Roskam (R-Ill.) thought he saw a smoking gun in an e-mail correspondence from August 2011 in which Blumenthal encouraged Clinton to \"make a public statement before the cameras\" when Libyan leader Moammar Gaddafi was deposed.<\/p><p>\"Two months before the end of the Gaddafi regime and you're already planning on how to make your statement dramatic to maximize political gain,\" Roskam scolded.<\/p><p>Relevance to the Benghazi attack? None.<\/p><p>Gowdy, for his part, found it damning that Clinton aides passed along some of Blumenthal's advice (which he got from a former intelligence official) to people including Stevens. \"It's relevant because our ambassador was asked to read and respond to Sidney Blumenthal's drivel,\" the chairman said, \"in some instances on the very same day he was asking for security.\"<\/p><p>Rep. Adam B. Schiff (Calif.), a Democrat, observed that for all the time the panel has spent on Blumenthal, you'd think \"that he was in Benghazi on the night, manning the barricades.\" During private testimony from Blumenthal, to which he was summoned by federal marshals, Republicans asked more than 160 questions about Blumenthal's associations with Bill and Hillary Clinton but fewer than 20 about the Benghazi attacks.<\/p><p>Schiff and Rep. Elijah E. Cummings (Md.), the ranking Democrat, proposed that Republicans, rather than selectively releasing Blumenthal's e-mails, come clean about their interest in him and make public the entire transcript of his testimony.

Try a couple of different spaces to see what works best for you before you commit. You can find a list of space around the world on the Coworking Wiki.<\/p><p>\"See if the people in the space are people who you could go and see every day\u2026if it's not, then go to the next space,\" says Jay Catalan, the co-founder of a coworking space in Vancouver called The Network Hub.<\/p><p>It's less awkward to introduce yourself on the first day than to work alongside someone for months before asking their name. Even if you're not usually outgoing, try to make a special effort for the first week or two when you start in a new coworking space.<\/p><p>\"Just make introductions and it goes a long way\u2026We've had some people they wish they had met sooner because it turns out they did similar lines of work and just talking about it or actually sharing work, it's not something you want to find out when you only have a couple more months left on your project or something,\" Park says.<\/p><p>If you're shy about meeting people, try getting creative (like, for instance, bringing food). Bill Jacobson and Dave Ulrich, who co-founded WorkBar, said that one new coworker at WorkBar Boston showed up with a big box of doughnuts. \"He got to know everybody pretty quick,\" Jacobson says.<\/p><p>Don't stop interacting with your coworkers after you introduce yourself. One of the biggest benefits of coworking is the built-in community of professionals working across different industries.<\/p><p>\"It may not seem directly 'productive' to chat with your coworker for 10 minutes mid-day, but indirectly, it yields greater results than almost anything else you could spend time on,\" says Parker Whitney, office manager for Philadelphia coworking space Independents Hall, though he says, \"Invest in your community by taking (not faking) interest in what its members do, and it will take you with it\u2026The people you've always wanted to know are sitting all around you. Ask questions. Learn. Most importantly, help them when you can.\"<\/p><p>If you are too busy during the workday for water cooler conversation, most coworking spaces host happy hours, seminars or other events that are prime opportunities for learning more about your coworkers.<\/p><p>\"Even when you work for yourself, it's important to realize your limitations,\" says Dave Martorana, a freelance Python & iPhone developer who works at Independents Hall. \"If you're a software developer, you're not necessarily a designer, product manager, or marketer as well. When you work at a coworking space, people with those skills probably work right next to you and are just as interested in building something awesome as you are.\"<\/p><p>While coworking one day, I ended up testing someone's website, getting caught in the crossfire of a music choice showdown, and participating in a raised-hand vote about which suit jacket a fellow coworker should wear to a meeting. Needless to say, the social aspects of coworking \u2014 despite their advantages \u2014 can be extremely distracting.<\/p><p>Which is why out of the 37 productivity tips that I collected for a previous article, this one from Paul Preibisch of B3D Multitech remains my favorite:<\/p><p>\"Rather than standing up from behind your wall of monitors and shouting, 'Can you all shut up?!' you may want to consider, what I call 'The Cone of Silence.' It really works! All you need are a nice pair of headphones, (not earbuds), a wave file that plays 'white noise,' and Windows Media Player set to auto-repeat.\"<\/p><p>The Coworking Resources Series is supported by join.me.

With Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, Connie Nielsen, Oliver Reed. Directed by Ridley Scott. At area theaters. Running time: 154 mins. Rated R: Gory violence, incest theme. 3 1\/2 Stars.<\/p><p>If there's a soft spot in your heart for the sword-&-sandal epic - and from the star rating above, I think you can guess where I stand - then you'll swoon with giddy delight over \"Gladiator,\" a sweaty, stylish hunkfest that takes you back to the days of \"Ben-Hur,\" \"Spartacus\" and the so recently departed Steve Reeves.<\/p><p>From his biceps to his gluteus, Maximus is maximus. This Roman general turned slave turned gladiator hasn't a shred of humor, but then, he doesn't have time for idle nonsense when he's lopping off heads all day. (The head-lopping is apparently his signature, like the mark of Zorro.)<\/p><p>In director Ridley Scott's thrilling, burnished epic, Maximus no sooner serves the empire by leveling Germania during a snowstorm than Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) tosses him a promotion he doesn't want - to succeed the aged emperor and whip Rome back into shape. All Maximus wants is to go home to his wife and child in the suburbs.<\/p><p>The careworn Russell Crowe is physically and temperamentally perfect for the part of Maximus. Still carrying some of the weight he packed on for \"The Insider,\" he's no gym-toned pretty boy. He's solid, beefy, rough-hewn, creaking along in his heavy leather costume, with a look on his puss of weary disdain.<\/p><p>What makes him sexy is his sense of honor and loyalty: \"What we do in life echoes in eternity!\" Anyway, it can't be his hygiene, although he is frequently bathed in a sanctifying golden glow.<\/p><p>After a coup by the emperor's weak-kneed son, Commodus (a whiny, surprisingly fleshy Joaquin Phoenix), Maximus' fortunes change. He winds up being thrown to the tigers, two shows daily, in Rome's Colosseum, the entertainment complex of its day.<\/p><p>Crowe, like his character, must grimly come to terms with the fact that, actor or gladiator, it's all about showmanship. Give the crowd what it wants, either at the multiplex or in the arena, and you can write your own ticket.<\/p><p>\"I have power only to amuse the mob,\" he spits contemptuously like a Shakespearean actor reduced to dinner theater.<\/p><p>The plot, about avenging honor, provides brief respite between an array of hand-to-hand battles that are pitched so furiously that individual components barely register; they're subliminal suggestions of computer-assisted carnage, with Jackson Pollock sprays of blood. For fans of the genre, yes, this is a good thing.<\/p><p>Connie Nielsen plays Commodus' sister and possible love interest for Maximus once his family is dispatched (politics, you know). Nielsen's costumes are laced up like bondage gear, and there is a tantalizing hint of romance past.<\/p><p>But the camera only has eyes for Crowe. The glowering! The seething! The hooded gaze! The quiet suffering! (Watch him carve away a tattoo he no longer has use for. No anesthetic! No disinfectant!)<\/p><p>The supporting cast makes for a gauntlet of worthy friends and adversaries, all of them thinkers, including Derek Jacobi (\"I, Claudius\") as a senator, Djimon Hounsou (\"Amistad\") as a fellow gladiator and Oliver Reed, who died with two days to go on the shoot, looking a little woozy as a gladiator entrepreneur.<\/p><p>Reed's character is the one most in touch with the movie's premise - that entertainment is the goal, and a worthy one at that.","291":"Jess Quinn is training for a 10km race.

I don't want to put myself in a category.\"","292":"Disunion follows the Civil War as it unfolded.<\/p><p>The Lincoln administration may not have gone to war in 1861 to end slavery, but no one bothered to tell that to the slaves. Within six weeks of the firing on Fort Sumter, Gen. Benjamin Butler was forced to decide what to do with three slaves who escaped to Fortress Monroe on the north shore of Virginia's James River. Butler, certainly no abolitionist, nonetheless refused to return the three to their owner, labeling them \"contrabands of war.\"<\/p><p>The term, suitably ambiguous for an administration that as yet had no policy on how to handle the fugitives, found immediate acceptance. As one Union officer wrote, \"Never was a word so speedily adopted by so many people in so short a time.\" Within weeks hundreds of \"contrabands\" \u2014 men, women and children \u2014 flocked to Fortress Monroe and other Union Army positions. Unsure what might greet them, the escaped slaves were yet confident that life under federal control must surely represent an improvement.<\/p><p>It took the federal government more than a year to devise a policy in answer to this thirst for freedom. In August 1861, the First Confiscation Act stripped slaveholders of their claim of ownership, but it failed to clarify whether the slaves were themselves free. The following March Congress prohibited the military from sending escaped slaves back into slavery, and in July the Second Confiscation Act decreed that all slaves that took refuge in Union areas were \"captives of war\" and would be set free.<\/p><p>These legislative actions took on ever greater significance as Union forces moved deeper and deeper into Confederate territory. The growing number of contrabands reaching federal lines necessitated the establishment of dozens of impromptu contraband camps. A draft map compiled by the National Park Service illustrates how the network of these generally transitory camps mirrored the advance of the Union Army along the Mississippi, Tennessee and Cumberland River systems. Grant's Army of the Tennessee spent the summer of 1862 protecting supply lines in western Tennessee and northern Mississippi. Victories at the Battle of Iuka in September and the Battle of Corinth in early October solidified Union control of the area.<\/p><p>Lincoln's announcement of the preliminary Emancipation Proclamation on Sept. 22, 1862, produced an even greater flood of refugees. How best to use and care for these contrabands proved particularly vexing for military leaders under Grant's command. \"You have no idea of the consternation Old Abe's Proclamation is making,\" wrote Gen. Grenville Dodge to his brother in September. The contrabands \"will not even wait until 1st January. I do not know what we shall do with them.\"<\/p><p>Many of these fugitives arrived in an appalling condition. \"There were men, women, and children in every stage of disease or decrepitude often nearly naked, with flesh torn by the terrible experiences of their escape,\" wrote one observer. \"Often the slaves met prejudices against their color more bitter than any they had left behind.\"<\/p><p>On Nov. 11, 1862, Grant took the first step toward addressing the crisis: he named John Eaton, a former high school principal and chaplain of the 27th Ohio Infantry, as superintendent of contrabands and set him at work \"organizing them into suitable companies for working.\" A month later he went further. \"The negroes will be clothed, and in every way provided for, out of their earnings\" \u2014 about 12.5 cents for each pound of cotton picked \u2014 \"so far as practicable,\" he ordered. \"In no case will negroes be forced into the service of the Government, or be enticed away from their homes except when it becomes a military necessity.\"<\/p><p>Grant's policies lent the contraband camps an official status and began to define what a freedman could and could not do once within the Union lines. Personally, Grant appears to have had no particular sympathy for the refugees. He seems to have recognized that, in the words of one observer, \"The soldiers of our army were a good deal opposed to serving the Negro in any manner.\" Nevertheless, the Union commander unreservedly supported Eaton's work and in the process enabled the creation of one of the war's most successful contraband camps, located at Corinth, Miss.<\/p><p>Although formally organized under the direction of General Dodge in early December 1862 and placed under the command of James M. Alexander, chaplain of the 66th Illinois, the Corinth camp likely came into existence as early as September. Initially housed in army tents no longer considered serviceable for Union troops, the freedmen were soon set to work downing trees and clearing land on which to build cabins and lay out streets, which were named for Union generals. Eventually the freedmen also built a four-room school, a commissary, a hospital, a church and an office. The entire camp was divided into wards, complete with ward masters and a police force.<\/p><p>In late 1862 the American Missionary Association sent its first volunteers to Corinth to help care for, educate and minister to the freedmen. In a memoir written years after the war, one such missionary recalled her experience. \"When brought face to face with the slaves,\" she wrote, \"it was like the discovery of a new race.\" The men and women who came to Corinth generally shared a paternalistic optimism and viewed the freedmen as childlike in their enthusiasm for both education and salvation.<\/p><p>The freedmen's thirst for knowledge was undeniable. \"You will find them every hour of daylight, at their books,\" observed the Rev. Edward Pierce in March of 1863. \"We cannot enter a cabin, or tent, but that we see from one to three with books.\" Within no time Pierce and his wife had more than 150 students, and by the end of the summer, the addition of more missionaries enabled the school to accommodate between 300 and 400 children as well as 60 adults at a night school. In August, one of the teachers estimated that as many as 1,000 freedmen had learned to read in the Corinth camp.<\/p><p>Organized religion followed closely on the heels of formal education. Reverend Olds \"saw an earnestness in reference to the Christian life that I have seldom seen. And as I saw their deep earnestness & heard their hearty responses,\" he said, \"I was led to ask where can we find a more impressible people than these?\"<\/p><p>The population of the camp fluctuated between 1,500 and 6,000, as large groups undertook assignments for the Union Army or contracted to work on local plantations. In March 1863, for example, the camp was home to 658 men, 1,440 women and 1,559 children. Among the men were 36 blacksmiths, 48 carpenters, 180 teamsters and 200 cooks. The female ranks included 80 seamstresses, 150 laundresses and 600 cooks. Two-thirds of the men and three-quarters of the women were married, and seven in eight women had children. According to John Eaton's records, the camp had experienced 900 cases of illness, 189 deaths and 45 births.<\/p><p>Life at Corinth changed dramatically after a May 1863 visit by Adj. Gen. Lorenzo Thomas, who was intent on recruiting thousands of contrabands for his newly formed black regiments. With the organization of the 1st Alabama Infantry of African Descent, later renamed the 55th United States Colored Troops, the camp lost most of its able-bodied men.<\/p><p>Their departure to fight left only the women, the young, the old and the infirm to carry on Eaton's ambitious agricultural program, which rested on the cooperative farming of large tracts of abandoned and confiscated land. The program put 400 acres under cultivation, 300 for cotton and 100 for vegetables. Each cabin also had its own subsistence garden. By May 1863, the success of the agricultural program and the presence of a multitude of skilled artisans produced a clear monthly profit of $4,000 to $5,000 for the government, as well as an admirably independent community that Eaton hoped might serve as a model for other camps.<\/p><p>Unfortunately, the success of the Corinth camp proved short-lived. Plans for a winter campaign by Union forces in January 1864 provided a grim reminder that the fate of the freedmen was always secondary to the triumph of the Union cause.

The president's push is part of a larger American effort to further isolate and increase pressure on Iran after accusing it of a plot to assassinate Saudi Arabia's ambassador to the United States.<\/p><p>If the United Nations' watchdog group agrees to publicize the evidence, including new data from recent months, it would almost certainly revive a debate that has been dormant during the Arab Spring about how aggressively the United States and its allies, including Israel, should move to halt Iran's suspected weapons program.<\/p><p>Over the longer term, several senior Obama administration officials said in interviews, they are mulling a ban on financial transactions with Iran's central bank \u2014 a move that has been opposed by China and other Asian nations. Also being considered is an expansion of the ban on the purchase of petroleum products sold by companies controlled by the country's elite military force, the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps.<\/p><p>The Revolutionary Guards are also believed to oversee the military side of the nuclear program, and they are the parent of the Quds Force, which Washington has accused of directing the assassination plot.<\/p><p>The proposed sanctions come as administration officials confront skepticism around the world about their allegations that Iran was behind the plot and limited options about what they can do \u2014 as well as growing pressure from Republicans and some Democrats in Congress to take tougher action against Iran, with the central bank and the oil industry high on lawmakers' lists.<\/p><p>All of the proposed sanctions carry with them considerable political and economic risks. Yukiya Amano, the cautious director general of the United Nations group, the International Atomic Energy Agency, talked publicly in September about publishing some of the most delicate data suggesting Iran worked on nuclear triggers and warheads. But officials who have spoken with him say he is concerned that his inspectors could be ejected from Iran, shutting the best, though narrow, window into its nuclear activities.<\/p><p>Similarly, China and Russia, among other major Iranian trading partners, have resisted further oil and financial sanctions, saying the goal of isolating Iran is a poor strategy. Even inside the Obama administration, some officials say they fear any crackdown on Iranian oil exports could drive up oil prices when the United States and European economies are weak. As one senior official put it, \"You don't want to tip the U.S. into a downturn just to punish the Iranians.\"<\/p><p>Senior administration officials, who would not speak publicly about internal negotiations over the sanctions, say no recommendation on acting against the central bank has gone to Mr. Obama, who vowed last week to make sure Iran would face the \"toughest sanctions\" for what he said was its role in the sensational scheme to hire a Mexican drug cartel to kill the Saudi envoy.<\/p><p>The decision to press the International Atomic Energy Agency was brewing even before the plot against the Saudi ambassador was discovered, but that discovery prompted the White House to pursue a full-court, public press of the agency to release the sensitive intelligence.<\/p><p>Officials familiar with the evidence say it creates extraordinarily uncomfortable questions for the Iranians to answer, but does not definitively point to the construction of a weapon. Instead, it details work on individual technologies essential for designing and detonating a nuclear device, including how to turn uranium into bomb fuel, how to cast conventional explosives in a shape that can set off a nuclear blast, and how to make detonators, generate neutrons to spur a chain reaction, measure detonation waves and make nose cones for missiles.<\/p><p>Tommy Vietor, the spokesman for the National Security Council, said Saturday that \"the United States believes that a comprehensive assessment would be invaluable for the international community in its consideration of Iran's nuclear program and what to do about it.\" Iran has declared that all of the documents suggesting work on how to create a weapon that could fit atop an Iranian missile are \"fabrications\" intended to justify an attack. The country has been the target of covert attacks, including the assassinations of some nuclear scientists and a computer worm that disabled some of Iran's nuclear centrifuges.<\/p><p>The Obama administration, since coming to office, has never publicly presented detailed evidence to back up its claim that Iran is driving toward a weapon or creating the technology to assemble one quickly, should it need it. But it has discussed the evidence widely with allies.<\/p><p>In part the administration has hesitated to discuss the evidence because, after the failure to find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq in 2003, any American evidence is considered suspect. Widespread questions about the plot against the Saudis last week underscored how deep those suspicions run.<\/p><p>But Iran is a different kind of case. Inspectors visit regularly, measuring Iran's output of uranium, including recent production of the material, enriched to 20 percent purity, that takes it far closer to the kind of fuel needed for a weapon. Iran said recently that it would produce more of the 20 percent enriched material than it needs for a small medical research reactor, which prompted new concerns that it is building a stockpile that could be converted to weapons use.","296":"NEW YORK -- Ruben Tejada thinks Chase Utley's late slide that broke his right leg was dirty.<\/p><p>Speaking about the play for the first time since Utley ended Tejada's season in Game 2 of the NL Division Series against the Los Angeles Dodgers, the Mets shortstop said he's no longer upset over it.<\/p><p>Using a blue cane adorned with a Mets logo giving to him by the team's owners, Tejada hung out with teammates in the dugout before Game 4 of the World Series.<\/p><p>He says he's come to terms with what happened, even though he never responded to the message Utley sent him through captain David Wright.

In its seventh edition, this annual festival of contemporary performance announces itself boldly, its name projected in big block letters on the facade of Abrons Arts Center, home to most of the festival's 18 boundary-blurring productions.<\/p><p>It doesn't take much to inject new life into an event sometimes at risk of stagnating, even as it champions the fresh, the unseen, the unexpected. At opening night on Thursday, visitors were guided from show to show through stairwells and hallways generally closed to the public. For anyone well acquainted with Abrons, as many Realness-goers are, this proved a simple, effective way to reinvent familiar spaces.<\/p><p>Masterminded by Thomas Benjamin Snapp Pryor, Realness coincides with the citywide conference of the Association of Performing Arts Presenters \u2014 international curators and producers in the market for new work \u2014 which returns each year like a recurring dream, or nightmare, depending on your relationship to the idea of shopping for live art. Last year's festival was full of work bemoaning the economic plight of performers; this year's first two productions struck out in less sullen directions, while still folding in some self-reflexive critique (also available in the form of Realness swag declaring, \"I Suffer From Realness\").<\/p><p>First was \"Culture Administration & Trembling,\" a biodiverse collaboration among the performers Jennifer Lacey, Antonija Livingstone, Dominique P\u00e9trin and Stephen Thompson. Ticket holders were instructed to remove their shoes, then led to the second floor of the arts complex, where a usually drab lobby had been transformed with geometric and botanical designs on the floor and walls.<\/p><p>Ms. Lacey, Ms. Livingstone, Mr. Thompson and Dana Michel crawled languidly around the asymmetrical room, the audience huddled around the perimeter, to a soundscape of intermittent bird song. Ms. P\u00e9trin appeared just as calmly immersed in her task of adorning the ground with origami squares. Three live snakes, delivered from offstage, soon joined in. Humans and reptiles slid over and around one another.<\/p><p>This was just the first of many tenuously related, increasingly chaotic episodes, including the arrival of two Chihuahuas (the snakes, not to worry, had exited) and a migration into the adjacent black-box theater for a ritualistic ringing of hand-held bells. A mysterious voice, accompanying a video projection, pronounced, \"This piece will not save us.\" Ms. Lacey, cradling a small, three-legged dog while bending and stretching her limbs, told a story about an artist and an institution (Realness, perhaps) trying to spice up their relationship like old lovers. What to do with all this information? I thought of dance as undomesticated wildlife, of the predators and prey involved in buying and selling performance.<\/p><p>Down one set of stairs and up another, in a tucked-away dance studio not often used for performances, the choreographer Heather Kravas, visiting from Seattle, offered the New York premiere of \"dead, disappears.\" Ms. Kravas was her own predator and protector in this stark, self-punishing solo, as she put herself through perilous paces inspired by the sculptor Richard Serra's \"Verb List,\" a series of actions that he associated with making his pieces.<\/p><p>What seemed at first like arbitrary acts of masochism \u2014 walking on tiptoe with a trash bag over her head while barking two-syllable phrases \u2014 deepened into a formidable exploration of language, the female body and the power play between them. Having duct-taped a pillow to a chair, as if it were a prisoner, Ms. Kravas pounded it with a long pole, shouting a list of alphabetized verbs, one per swipe. By the end, in whatever this struggle had been, she had secured the upper hand.<\/p><p>American Realness continues through Jan. 17.

Scared of what people will think, scared it makes me look weak or unprofessional,\" she writes.<\/p><p>\"When friends or comics ask why we broke up, it's not easy or comfortable to reply; it doesn't seem like the appropriate thing to say at a stand-up show, a party or a wedding. It's embarrassing. I feel stupid. After being verbally, physically abused and raped, I dated him for two more months. It's not simple.\"<\/p><p>Ultimately, Stelling couldn't exclude such a significant piece of her story from her onstage persona, even if it meant risking ridicule from the close-knit comedy community.<\/p><p>\"After I broke up with him, he said, 'You're very open and honest in your stand-up, and I just ask that you consider me when you talk about your ex because everyone knows who you're talking about.' And I abided. I wrote vague jokes because we both live in L.A., and I didn't want to hurt him, start a war, press charges, be interrogated or harassed by him or his friends and family. I wanted to move on and forget because I didn't understand,\" Stelling shares.<\/p><p>\"I don't want revenge or to hurt him now, but it's unhealthy to keep this inside because my stand-up is pulled directly from my life. It's how I make my living. My personal is my professional. That is how I've always been; I make dark, funny. So now I'm allowing this to be part of my story.\"<\/p><p>Stelling says she's already started joking about the relationship and asked her followers to \"have the courage to listen and accept.\"<\/p><p>So far, the funny lady has been getting a positive response to her openness at the mic.<\/p><p>\"Already since talking about this onstage, many women have come to me after shows asking me to keep doing it,\" she says on Instagram. \"Men have shown their solidarity.\"","299":"The White House tried Sunday to win support for President Obama's forthcoming budget, arguing the plan is a balanced approach to economic prosperity and warning Republicans about stonewalling negotiations and pushing a \"rejected\" Romney plan.<\/p><p>\"Right now, the approach of many Republicans, particularly the leadership in the House, is my way or the highway,\" senior White House adviser Dan Pfeiffer told \"Fox News Sunday.\" \"Their view is the only acceptable plan is to try to \u2026 essentially enact the Romney economic plan. The American people rejected that, and Republicans shouldn't be doubling down on it.\"<\/p><p>The White House effort comes three days before Obama releases his 2014 budget, which is expected to include a mix of tax increases and cuts to such entitlements as Social Security and Medicare.<\/p><p>\"You can do both,\" Pfeiffer said on ABC's \"This Week.\" \"That's what you'll see. \u2026 What we won't do is cut our way to prosperity.\"<\/p><p>However, the outline of the plan has already been criticized by Republicans and some of the president's staunchest supporters.<\/p><p>The release of the budget Wednesday, which will be followed by Obama meeting for dinner with Senate Republicans, is just part of a busy week in Washington.<\/p><p>Congress returns from a two-week break with the Senate attempting to reach a bipartisan agreement on immigration-reform legislation, and the leaders of the Democrat-controlled chamber trying to finish a gun-control proposal that might or might not include the contentious universal background checks for buyers.<\/p><p>Pfeiffer told Fox the meeting with Senate Republicans is simply an attempt to find a \"caucus of common sense,\" not end run leaders of the Republican-controlled House.<\/p><p>Last week, House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, said Obama's budget blueprint holds reforms \"hostage\" to tax increases. Organized labor also expressed its disappointment in the plan.<\/p><p>\"The president should drop these misguided cuts in benefits and focus instead on building support in Congress for investing in jobs,\" AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka said.<\/p><p>Obama supporters disagree particularly with the part of his spending plan that calls for a new inflation formula that would reduce the annual cost of living adjustments for a range of government programs, including Social Security and benefits for veterans.<\/p><p>Still, South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham expressed optimism Sunday about the plan, suggesting it was at least a starting point toward an elusive, long-term budget deal between Democrats and Republicans.<\/p><p>\"The president is showing a little bit of leg here,\" Graham said on NBC's \"Meet the Press.\" \"This is somewhat encouraging. We're beginning to set the stage for the grand bargain.\"<\/p><p>Among the highlights of the president's plan is spending cuts and tax increases that would reduce the deficit by $1.8 trillion over 10 years, replacing the $1.2 trillion in automatic spending cuts, known as sequester, over the same period.<\/p><p>The proposal also is expected to include new spending for public works projects, early education and job training, as well as $580 billion in new taxes that Republicans oppose.<\/p><p>Counting reductions and higher taxes that Congress and Obama have approved since 2011, the 2014 budget would contribute $4.3 trillion to total deficit reduction by 2023.<\/p><p>On Saturday, the president said his budget was not his \"ideal plan,\" but it was a compromise that he would be willing to accept.<\/p><p>The House and Senate have already passed their own budget plans.

Fewer voters than expected turned out.<\/p><p>Editor's note: John Avlon is a CNN contributor and senior political columnist for Newsweek and The Daily Beast. He is co-editor of the book \"Deadline Artists: America's Greatest Newspaper Columns.\"<\/p><p>(CNN) -- Beneath Rick Santorum's stunning three-state sweep on Tuesday stands another stubborn sign of dissatisfaction with the status quo: Republican turnout is down.<\/p><p>I'm talking embarrassingly, disturbingly, hey-don't-you-know-it's-an-election-year bad. It is a sign of a serious enthusiasm gap among the rank and file, and a particularly bad omen for Mitt Romney and the GOP in the general election.<\/p><p>Here's the tale of the tape, state by state, beginning with Tuesday night: Minnesota had just more than 47,000 people turn out for its caucuses this year -- four years ago it was nearly 63,000 -- and Romney came in first, not a distant third as he did Tuesday night. In Colorado, more than 70,000 people turned out for its caucus in 2008 -- but in 2012 it was 65,000. And Missouri -- even making a generous discount for the fact that this was an entirely symbolic contest -- had 232,000 people turn out, less than half the number who did four years ago.<\/p><p>Even with months of pre-primary hype and attention solely devoted to the Republican field, turnout in this election cycle essentially flat-lined. In Iowa, a little more than 121,000 people voted, compared with nearly 119,000 four years before, when action in the Democratic caucuses absorbed most of the attention.<\/p><p>In New Hampshire, the same dynamic applied -- 245,000 voters turned out in 2012, compared with 241,000 four years before, despite Republicans being the only game in town and independents making up 47% of the total turnout in 2012, according to CNN exit polls. Take out the independent voters and you've got a deep net decline.<\/p><p>Always proudly rebellious, South Carolina has been the great outlier in this election cycle. With Newt Gingrich making an all-out push for conservatives in a conservative state, turnout was up almost 150,000 over four years before.<\/p><p>But in Florida, the decline became unmistakable. Maybe it decreased because the Romney and Gingrich campaigns, plus super PACS, spent more than $18 million in the Sunshine State on TV ads, of which 93% were negative in the last week alone, according to the Campaign Media Analysis Group. After all, negative ads depress turnout. But after all the mud was thrown, 1.6 million people turned out in the nation's fourth largest state, which might sound impressive until you compare it with the nearly 2 million who turned out in 2008.<\/p><p>Nevada was even worse, with 32,894 people turning out to vote in a state with more than 465,000 registered Republicans. Four years before, more than 44,300 participated in the caucus. Turnout was down more than 25% despite the GOP caucuses being the only game in town. Party officials were expecting a turnout of more than 70,000.<\/p><p>All this should be a wake-up call for the GOP. Despite an enormous amount of national media attention devoted to each of the states to date, the response has been a notable yawn among the Republican rank and file.<\/p><p>The turnout numbers are even worse when you compare them with the number of registered Republicans in each state that has voted to date.<\/p><p>The caucuses in particular bring out an unrepresentative sample of a state's Republican Party. For all the grass-roots romanticism, there has got to be a better way to pick a presidential nominee.<\/p><p>But the news is worst for Romney, long the presumptive front-runner in a party that tends to reward the man next in line.<\/p><p>\"Reluctantly Romney\" could be a bumper sticker, even for his supporters. The former Massachusetts governor has found it difficult to climb above 35% in national polls, meaning that a majority of Republicans still support someone else in a notably weak field. His vote margins and totals lag behind those of four years before, when he lost the nomination to John McCain in a crowded and comparatively competent field, although Minnesota is the first state he won in '08 and lost in 2012.<\/p><p>You reap what you sow, and part of the reason turnout is down is directly related to the problem of polarization. The Republican Party is more ideologically polarized than at any time in recent history. Therefore, it put up more purely right-wing candidates than it did four years before, when center-right leaders such as McCain and Rudy Giuliani were also in the race. A bigger tent inspired bigger turnout.<\/p><p>But the other reason is simple dissatisfaction with the candidates.<\/p><p>Republicans seem united in their anger against the president -- like the Democrats in 2004 -- but they are uninspired by their options. Draft movements for fantasy candidates ranging from Chris Christie to Mitch Daniels to Paul Ryan and even Jeb Bush have started and failed. Some party leaders show more enthusiasm for a hypothetical 2016 crop of candidates, including Marco Rubio and Bobby Jindal, than they do for the flawed choices before them in this election. Divided and dispirited is an odd place for the Republican Party to be so soon after the enthusiasms of the 2010 tea party-driven election.<\/p><p>The bottom line is that voter turnout matters. And what should be most troubling for Republicans is that this enthusiasm gap among the conservative base is accompanied by a lack of candidates who might appeal to independents and centrist swing voters in the general election. It is a double barrel of bad news for the Republican Party. The numbers can be spun and rationalized by professional partisan operatives all day long, but the fact remains -- voters just aren't turning out to cast their votes for this crop of conservative candidates in 2012.<\/p><p>Follow CNN Opinion on Twitter.<\/p><p>Join the conversation on Facebook.<\/p><p>The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John Avlon.","303":"WASHINGTON \u2014 President Obama is pressing United Nations nuclear inspectors to release classified intelligence information showing that Iran is designing and experimenting with nuclear weapons technology. The president's push is part of a larger American effort to further isolate and increase pressure on Iran after accusing it of a plot to assassinate Saudi Arabia's ambassador to the United States.<\/p><p>If the United Nations' watchdog group agrees to publicize the evidence, including new data from recent months, it would almost certainly revive a debate that has been dormant during the Arab Spring about how aggressively the United States and its allies, including Israel, should move to halt Iran's suspected weapons program.<\/p><p>Over the longer term, several senior Obama administration officials said in interviews, they are mulling a ban on financial transactions with Iran's central bank \u2014 a move that has been opposed by China and other Asian nations. Also being considered is an expansion of the ban on the purchase of petroleum products sold by companies controlled by the country's elite military force, the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps.<\/p><p>The Revolutionary Guards are also believed to oversee the military side of the nuclear program, and they are the parent of the Quds Force, which Washington has accused of directing the assassination plot.<\/p><p>The proposed sanctions come as administration officials confront skepticism around the world about their allegations that Iran was behind the plot and limited options about what they can do \u2014 as well as growing pressure from Republicans and some Democrats in Congress to take tougher action against Iran, with the central bank and the oil industry high on lawmakers' lists.<\/p><p>All of the proposed sanctions carry with them considerable political and economic risks. Yukiya Amano, the cautious director general of the United Nations group, the International Atomic Energy Agency, talked publicly in September about publishing some of the most delicate data suggesting Iran worked on nuclear triggers and warheads. But officials who have spoken with him say he is concerned that his inspectors could be ejected from Iran, shutting the best, though narrow, window into its nuclear activities.<\/p><p>Similarly, China and Russia, among other major Iranian trading partners, have resisted further oil and financial sanctions, saying the goal of isolating Iran is a poor strategy. Even inside the Obama administration, some officials say they fear any crackdown on Iranian oil exports could drive up oil prices when the United States and European economies are weak. As one senior official put it, \"You don't want to tip the U.S. into a downturn just to punish the Iranians.\"<\/p><p>Senior administration officials, who would not speak publicly about internal negotiations over the sanctions, say no recommendation on acting against the central bank has gone to Mr. Obama, who vowed last week to make sure Iran would face the \"toughest sanctions\" for what he said was its role in the sensational scheme to hire a Mexican drug cartel to kill the Saudi envoy.<\/p><p>The decision to press the International Atomic Energy Agency was brewing even before the plot against the Saudi ambassador was discovered, but that discovery prompted the White House to pursue a full-court, public press of the agency to release the sensitive intelligence.<\/p><p>Officials familiar with the evidence say it creates extraordinarily uncomfortable questions for the Iranians to answer, but does not definitively point to the construction of a weapon. Instead, it details work on individual technologies essential for designing and detonating a nuclear device, including how to turn uranium into bomb fuel, how to cast conventional explosives in a shape that can set off a nuclear blast, and how to make detonators, generate neutrons to spur a chain reaction, measure detonation waves and make nose cones for missiles.<\/p><p>Tommy Vietor, the spokesman for the National Security Council, said Saturday that \"the United States believes that a comprehensive assessment would be invaluable for the international community in its consideration of Iran's nuclear program and what to do about it.\" Iran has declared that all of the documents suggesting work on how to create a weapon that could fit atop an Iranian missile are \"fabrications\" intended to justify an attack. The country has been the target of covert attacks, including the assassinations of some nuclear scientists and a computer worm that disabled some of Iran's nuclear centrifuges.<\/p><p>The Obama administration, since coming to office, has never publicly presented detailed evidence to back up its claim that Iran is driving toward a weapon or creating the technology to assemble one quickly, should it need it. But it has discussed the evidence widely with allies.<\/p><p>In part the administration has hesitated to discuss the evidence because, after the failure to find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq in 2003, any American evidence is considered suspect. Widespread questions about the plot against the Saudis last week underscored how deep those suspicions run.<\/p><p>But Iran is a different kind of case. Inspectors visit regularly, measuring Iran's output of uranium, including recent production of the material, enriched to 20 percent purity, that takes it far closer to the kind of fuel needed for a weapon. Iran said recently that it would produce more of the 20 percent enriched material than it needs for a small medical research reactor, which prompted new concerns that it is building a stockpile that could be converted to weapons use.","304":"Talk to anyone involved in the action-movie glory days of the 1980s and the first thing they'll say is that it's time to bring those days back. \"In today's world. we need heroes,\" Aaron Norris, brother of Chuck and an important behind-the-scenes figure in that heyday, told us when we interviewed him recently. \"Our action movies have gotten too artsy.\"<\/p><p>Artsy sort of left the room this weekend, when Sylvester Stallone's \"The Expendables,\" which assembled a team of muscle-bound mercenaries to fight indisputably evil (but ideologically harmless) enemies in far-off lands, got audiences excited, to<\/p><p>Until this weekend, old-school action movies -- defined, for argument's sake, as films with a slew of explosions, a shortage of moral ambiguity and a triumph of physical effects over digital ones -- had seen better days.

Small businesses and families starving for credit will eventually get relief as the funding props up banks and they increase lending, but Rajoy didn't offer guidance on when.<\/p><p>Spain on Saturday became the fourth \u2014 and largest \u2014 of the 17 countries that use Europe's common currency to request a bailout \u2014 a big blow to a nation that a few years ago took pride as the continent's economic superstar only to see it become the hot spot in the eurozone debt crisis. Its economy is the eurozone's fourth largest after Germany, France and Italy.<\/p><p>Across the country, Spaniards reacted with a mixture of anger and relief to the news. The amount of the rescue fund, if all is tapped, amounts to \u20ac21,000 of new debt for each person in the nation of 47 million where the average annual salary for those with work is about the same amount and the unemployment rate for those under age 25 is 52 percent.<\/p><p>The country is already reeling from deep austerity cuts Rajoy has imposed over the last six months that have raised taxes, made it easier to hire and fire workers, and cut deep into cherished government programs including education and national health care.<\/p><p>\"It's obviously a shame,\" said civil servant Luisa Saraguren, 44, as she strolled on a sunny Sunday morning with her young daughter. \"But this bailout was fully predictable, and the consequences of this help are going to be a lot bigger compared to the cuts we've been living with already.\"<\/p><p>Rajoy took pains to avoid the word bailout Sunday, saying Spain's rescue package is a line of credit that its most troubled banks will be able to tap. The assistance will not come with the outside control over government macroeconomic policy like that imposed Greece, Ireland and Portugal when their public finances were bailed out.<\/p><p>He said interest rates on the loans will be considerably lower than the rate near 7 percent that Spain has been forced to pay recently on the international debt markets, a level that forced the other countries to seek bailouts.<\/p><p>Spain will regain the economic credibility it has lost by shoring up its banks, which will result in credit being restored so businesses and individuals shut off from loans can start borrowing and the economy will grow again, Rajoy insisted, again without saying when.<\/p><p>Europe's widening recession and financial crisis has hurt companies and investors around the world. Providing a financial lifeline to Spanish banks is likely to relieve anxiety on the Spanish economy \u2014 which is five times larger than Greece's \u2014 and on markets concerned about the country's ability to pay its way.<\/p><p>Spain's financial problems are not due to Greek-style government over-spending. The country's banks particularly its savings banks or \"cajas,\" got caught up in the collapse of a real estate bubble in 2008 that got worse over the past four years. However, as Spain's leaders have struggled for a solution to their banking crisis, the country's borrowing costs have soared close to the level that forced the governments of Greece, Portugal and Ireland to seek rescues.<\/p><p>Some of Spain's banks are struggling with by toxic real estate loans and assets amid fears the problem will get worse as more jobless people can't pay their mortgages. The Bank of Spain says the toxic loans and assets total around \u20ac180 billion. Nationalized lender Bankia SA, which has requested \u20ac19 billion in aid, has \u20ac32 billion in toxic assets. Around four other banks serving the domestic market are considered prime candidates for bailouts.<\/p><p>\"I could never get my mind round the scale of consumption in Spain over the past 20 years, having known it in the 1960s when it was still extremely poor,\" said Paul Preston, a history professor and expert on Spain with the London School of Economics. \"Lots of people enjoyed the consumer boom, but not everybody. Now everybody's having to pay for it.\"<\/p><p>Rajoy blamed Spain's woes on the previous Socialist administration of Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero without mentioning him or his government by name. Zapatero was ousted by Rajoy in a landslide last November by voters outraged over the Socialist handling of the economy.<\/p><p>\"Last year Spain's public administration spent \u20ac90 billion more than it took in, this can't be maintained, we can't live like that,\" Rajoy said.<\/p><p>But Socialist Party leader Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba said Rajoy should acknowledge that Spain is now in bailout territory.<\/p><p>\"The government is trying to make us believe that we've won the lottery, that the Three Kings of Orient have arrived, and that isn't so,\" Rubalcaba said.<\/p><p>After his press conference, Rajoy defended his decision to jet off an hour later to Poland to see Spain's famed national football team take on Italy in the Euro 2012 competition. He said he would be on the ground in Gdansk only for the game before flying back to Madrid Sunday night.<\/p><p>\"I'll be there two and a half hours and then I'll leave,\" Rajoy said. \"I think the national team deserves it.\"","310":"Writer-director Richard Linklater has described his latest film, \"Everybody Wants Some!!,\" as a \"spiritual sequel\" to 1993's \"Dazed and Confused.\" That made my heart fibrillate a little, and maybe yours too. Beginning with its shot of a Pontiac GTO pulling doughnuts in a high school parking lot to Aerosmith's \"Sweet Emotion,\" \"Dazed\" is such a humane approximation of what it was like to come of age in the mid-1970s that one wishes it would never end. On the evidence of \"Boyhood\" and the \"Before Sunrise\" trilogy, though, Linklater doesn't want any of his movies to end. Thus \"Everybody Wants Some!!\"<\/p><p>Which at first is different, sometimes jarringly so, before wading into the open-armed embrace of experience that marks this filmmaker's finest work. The tipoffs are those double exclamation points and an onscreen title font that recalls a Skinemax late-night movie circa 1981. What if you took one of that era's hormone-drenched stu-coms and put real people in it?<\/p><p>The year is 1980, actually, and Jake (Blake Jenner from \"Glee\") is arriving for his freshman year at (the fictional) Southeastern Texas State University. A high school pitching star and rangy college prospect, he's assigned an off-campus baseball dorm with the other players. It's a ready-made animal house, with rules laid down by a briefly seen coach (Jonathan Breck) that are immediately ignored. Occasionally we'll get an onscreen reminder of how many dwindling days and hours remain before classes begin. These, too, are ignored.<\/p><p>Instead, Linklater parks his cameras to observe, with indulgence and much good humor, the bonding rituals of young men who only think they have it figured out. Jake's housemates fall into general categories that re-sort themselves into individual personalities: The motor-mouthed ladies' man Finnegan (Glen Powell), the Zen surfer-stoner Willoughby (Wyatt Russell), uber-competitive McReynolds (Tyler Hoechlin), country rube Billy (Will Brittain), smartass Nesbit (Austin Amelio), na\u00efve Brumley (Tanner Kalina). And so on.<\/p><p>A few stand slightly outside the pack: the over-confident psycho-nerd pitcher Jay Niles (Juston Street, freakily funny) and the laconic second base star Dale Douglas (J. Quinton Johnson), whose blackness is rarely commented on. Where are the women? There to be chased and partied with and seduced. \"This is college, Jake,\" the hero is told early on. \"The girls can be as big sluts as the guys.\"<\/p><p>Oh, dear. Is \"Everybody Wants Some!!\" what happens when you people an entire Richard Linklater movie with Matthew McConaughey's horndog Wooderson from \"Dazed and Confused\"? Yes and no, or, rather, yes, but only at first. As the boys sprawl through the last days of summer, the swagger that borders on smug begins to mellow and melt away. Searching for good times and girls, they hop from a disco one night to a country and western bar the next to a punk mosh pit to an art-student costume party, minds open, adapting, ever-changing. After a while, the hero starts having a smallish identity crisis, confessing that \"it sort of begs the question of who we are.\"<\/p><p>Well, yes. This is college, Jake. Even a high school sports star can be anyone he wants.<\/p><p>The movie eventually spins him off from the crowd into the arms of Beverly (Zoey Deutch), a tartly ardent stage arts freshman with Joni Mitchell posters on her wall. She's unpretentious for a theater brat, he's smart and soulful for a jock, and the two stand dazzled in the Venn diagram overlap of their attraction. These scenes try a little too hard to be charming but they are anyway, and if Deutch has the freckles and immediacy of a classic Brat Pack heroine, it may be because her mother is Lea Thompson of \"Back to the Future\" and \"Some Kind of Wonderful\" and her father is Howard Deutch, who directed the latter.<\/p><p>More second-generation pleasures: Wyatt Russell, who plays the woolly baseball mystic Willoughby, is the son of Kurt Russell and Goldie Hawn, and he has a high old time \u2014 emphasis on high \u2014 explaining to his teammates why \"Fearless,\" from the 1971 album \"Meddle,\" is the best track that Pink Floyd ever recorded. Because he is correct, I am awarding \"Everybody Wants Some!!\" an extra half-star.<\/p><p>Linklater was a high school baseball player who went to Sam Houston State on a scholarship, and the movie is steeped in the lazy, rivalrous minutiae of college ball. Willoughby gets off a moment of bliss when he muses on the pleasures of pitching \u2014 \"It's lovely out there on the bump,\" he says \u2014 and we learn that it's the .230 hitters who are always the most superstitious. Also that it's possible to slice a pitched baseball in half with an ax.

Ms. Temple said the longer Mr. Akin waited, the more difficult it would get.<\/p><p>The first deadline for Mr. Akin to have easily withdrawn from the race was Tuesday evening. His decision to stay in the race means that he now has only a few weeks to reconsider before things get even harder.<\/p><p>Certification of the presidential ballots in Missouri will be no later than Sept. 17, and could be shortly after President Obama officially accepts the Democratic nomination on Sept. 5.<\/p><p>Once the ballots are printed, any candidate who seeks to withdraw must pay for the reprinting of new ballots. That could be prohibitively expensive for Mr. Akin, but presumably the Republican Party \u2014 which badly wants him to withdraw \u2014 would cover the cost.<\/p><p>Military overseas ballots begin shipping out Sept. 22. That might be the first firm deadline. But the drop-dead deadline is Sept. 25, when general absentee ballots are sent out.<\/p><p>Mel Carnahan, the former Missouri governor and Ms. Carnahan's father, died on Oct. 16, 2000, during his campaign for the Senate against the Republican incumbent, John Ashcroft. Mr. Carnahan's name nonetheless appeared on the ballot in November \u2014 and he won. (His widow, Jean, was appointed to the seat, and lost it in special election in 2002.)<\/p><p>Assuming that Mr. Akin bows to pressure from Republican leaders (or simply concludes that he isn't able to raise enough money to mount a credible campaign), Missouri law requires that he seek a court order allowing him to drop out of the race.<\/p><p>State officials say that issuing such court orders is routine. Mr. Akin would merely have to file the necessary papers with the court and his name would no longer be printed on the November ballot. Republicans could then quickly nominate someone else to run against Senator Claire McCaskill, the Democratic incumbent.<\/p><p>Democrats would no doubt like to see Mr. Akin \u2014 now politically weakened by his comments on rape and pregnancy \u2014 stay in the race. In theory, the Democratic officials who run the state's election offices could object to Mr. Akin's request for a court order, a move that would force a hearing before a judge.<\/p><p>The relevant statute says someone like Mr. Akin can withdraw \"pursuant to a court order, which, except for good cause shown by the election authority in opposition thereto, shall be freely given upon application by the candidate to the circuit court in the county of such candidate's residence.\"<\/p><p>Election officials say they can find no precedent at all for such an objection in the state's history. But Ms. Carnahan is herself a factor in Republican minds. As the Democratic Senate nominee in 2010, she lost to Representative Roy Blunt, and Republicans imagine she could put up a fight.<\/p><p>\"The secretary's job is to protect the rights of Missouri voters,\" Ms. Temple said when asked whether Ms. Carnahan would fight a court order to remove Mr. Akin's name from the ballot.<\/p><p>A further complication: Under state law, any election authority in Missouri can oppose a withdrawal order, down to the county and city level, and there are Democrats aplenty in Missouri. But Ms. Temple added that right now, it would be up to a Missouri court to determine whether Mr. Akin could withdraw, not the secretary of state.<\/p><p>\"It's completely in the hands of the court to decide the facts,\" she said.<\/p><p>Assuming Mr. Akin does manage to drop out, the state central committee of the Republican Party in Missouri would have to pick a new candidate within 28 days, or by Oct. 12, whichever comes first.","312":"Most people, asked to identify the most universal shift in law enforcement over the past 15 years, would likely think of militarization, calls for community policing, or perhaps the slow decline of \"broken windows\".<\/p><p>But from the turn of the millennium to date, arguably no development has been more widespread in law enforcement than the adoption of so called \"less-lethal\" electric control devices (ECD), which many people know by the name of their most prolific manufacturer: Taser International.

It's not simple.\"<\/p><p>Ultimately, Stelling couldn't exclude such a significant piece of her story from her onstage persona, even if it meant risking ridicule from the close-knit comedy community.<\/p><p>\"After I broke up with him, he said, 'You're very open and honest in your stand-up, and I just ask that you consider me when you talk about your ex because everyone knows who you're talking about.'

Fewer voters than expected turned out.<\/p><p>Editor's note: John Avlon is a CNN contributor and senior political columnist for Newsweek and The Daily Beast. He is co-editor of the book \"Deadline Artists: America's Greatest Newspaper Columns.\"<\/p><p>(CNN) -- Beneath Rick Santorum's stunning three-state sweep on Tuesday stands another stubborn sign of dissatisfaction with the status quo: Republican turnout is down.<\/p><p>I'm talking embarrassingly, disturbingly, hey-don't-you-know-it's-an-election-year bad. It is a sign of a serious enthusiasm gap among the rank and file, and a particularly bad omen for Mitt Romney and the GOP in the general election.<\/p><p>Here's the tale of the tape, state by state, beginning with Tuesday night: Minnesota had just more than 47,000 people turn out for its caucuses this year -- four years ago it was nearly 63,000 -- and Romney came in first, not a distant third as he did Tuesday night. In Colorado, more than 70,000 people turned out for its caucus in 2008 -- but in 2012 it was 65,000. And Missouri -- even making a generous discount for the fact that this was an entirely symbolic contest -- had 232,000 people turn out, less than half the number who did four years ago.<\/p><p>Even with months of pre-primary hype and attention solely devoted to the Republican field, turnout in this election cycle essentially flat-lined. In Iowa, a little more than 121,000 people voted, compared with nearly 119,000 four years before, when action in the Democratic caucuses absorbed most of the attention.<\/p><p>In New Hampshire, the same dynamic applied -- 245,000 voters turned out in 2012, compared with 241,000 four years before, despite Republicans being the only game in town and independents making up 47% of the total turnout in 2012, according to CNN exit polls. Take out the independent voters and you've got a deep net decline.<\/p><p>Always proudly rebellious, South Carolina has been the great outlier in this election cycle. With Newt Gingrich making an all-out push for conservatives in a conservative state, turnout was up almost 150,000 over four years before.<\/p><p>But in Florida, the decline became unmistakable. Maybe it decreased because the Romney and Gingrich campaigns, plus super PACS, spent more than $18 million in the Sunshine State on TV ads, of which 93% were negative in the last week alone, according to the Campaign Media Analysis Group. After all, negative ads depress turnout. But after all the mud was thrown, 1.6 million people turned out in the nation's fourth largest state, which might sound impressive until you compare it with the nearly 2 million who turned out in 2008.<\/p><p>Nevada was even worse, with 32,894 people turning out to vote in a state with more than 465,000 registered Republicans. Four years before, more than 44,300 participated in the caucus. Turnout was down more than 25% despite the GOP caucuses being the only game in town. Party officials were expecting a turnout of more than 70,000.<\/p><p>All this should be a wake-up call for the GOP. Despite an enormous amount of national media attention devoted to each of the states to date, the response has been a notable yawn among the Republican rank and file.<\/p><p>The turnout numbers are even worse when you compare them with the number of registered Republicans in each state that has voted to date.<\/p><p>The caucuses in particular bring out an unrepresentative sample of a state's Republican Party. For all the grass-roots romanticism, there has got to be a better way to pick a presidential nominee.<\/p><p>But the news is worst for Romney, long the presumptive front-runner in a party that tends to reward the man next in line.<\/p><p>\"Reluctantly Romney\" could be a bumper sticker, even for his supporters. The former Massachusetts governor has found it difficult to climb above 35% in national polls, meaning that a majority of Republicans still support someone else in a notably weak field. His vote margins and totals lag behind those of four years before, when he lost the nomination to John McCain in a crowded and comparatively competent field, although Minnesota is the first state he won in '08 and lost in 2012.<\/p><p>You reap what you sow, and part of the reason turnout is down is directly related to the problem of polarization. The Republican Party is more ideologically polarized than at any time in recent history. Therefore, it put up more purely right-wing candidates than it did four years before, when center-right leaders such as McCain and Rudy Giuliani were also in the race. A bigger tent inspired bigger turnout.<\/p><p>But the other reason is simple dissatisfaction with the candidates.<\/p><p>Republicans seem united in their anger against the president -- like the Democrats in 2004 -- but they are uninspired by their options. Draft movements for fantasy candidates ranging from Chris Christie to Mitch Daniels to Paul Ryan and even Jeb Bush have started and failed. Some party leaders show more enthusiasm for a hypothetical 2016 crop of candidates, including Marco Rubio and Bobby Jindal, than they do for the flawed choices before them in this election. Divided and dispirited is an odd place for the Republican Party to be so soon after the enthusiasms of the 2010 tea party-driven election.<\/p><p>The bottom line is that voter turnout matters. And what should be most troubling for Republicans is that this enthusiasm gap among the conservative base is accompanied by a lack of candidates who might appeal to independents and centrist swing voters in the general election.

When the shoebox-shaped and nearly shoebox-size panini shop opened on Bedford Street 15 years ago, there was nothing quite like it in New York, a restaurant that kept things simple and kept prices low, serving flavorful food in a room that was just adorable enough that you could decide, midmeal, that maybe the two of you squeezed into the counter were there on a date, and not just grabbing a bite.<\/p><p>You have to fire up the Wayback Machine to better understand how 'ino helped change how this city eats. Fifteen years ago, New York was a bistro town. There was the old guard: Blue Ribbon, Le Gamin, Jules, Lucky Strike, Raoul's and a dozen others. Then in 1997, a newcomer opened in SoHo named Balthazar, which raised the stakes with its set direction and unlisted reservation line. Balthazar was white-hot: it had perfectly distressed mirrors, fresh and crusty bread, and although it was impossible to get a table unless you knew somebody who knew somebody, you could always go at midnight and eat at the bar.<\/p><p>Soon, New York was lousy with bistros. It was a good era if you wanted a kir, steak frites, escargot, fris\u00e9e lardon, profiteroles. Authenticity, or some version of it, was the point. Everybody was pressing butter into little ramekins to be served at room temperature, changing the paper covering the tablecloths before serving dessert.<\/p><p>Honestly, it was really fun. The restaurants were lively, intimate, sexy. So what if you could recite the menu before you set foot in the door? But if you were a young chef with a measure of vision and creativity, you were stuck either making onion soup and beet salad with goat cheese. Or you worked on the line executing the vision and creativity of an older chef in Midtown or TriBeCa. Prune hadn't yet opened. Neither had Diner. Brooklyn didn't have much of a food scene outside the restaurant row on Smith Street, which was anchored by Patois, a bistro. If you went to Williamsburg, it was to go to a party or to go dancing, not to eat. This was the landscape when Jason and Jennifer Denton opened 'ino on a quiet street in the West Village. The kitchen in the back was the size of a D.J. booth and used the technology of induction burners, which was novel at the time: it was a paninoteca that looked as if it belonged in New York rather than being shipped, tile by mirrored tile, from Milan.<\/p><p>The culinary vocabulary was Italian, but it wasn't sepia-toned and sentimental. Instead, there was a focus on ingredients at a time when, in New York at least, few people cared. It had simple food done well, and sometimes you encountered flavors that weren't lifted out of the songbook. I still have a 13-year-old memory of sharing a shredded duck sandwich with sweet relish, a combination that is about as authentically Italian as a functioning parliament. You could go to 'ino to get something familiar (prosciutto and cheese will never get old), but you could also try something new.<\/p><p>'Ino was a casual joint with integrity, an easygoing place where you could eat well as long as you didn't mind the wait. Today, we take this combination for granted, and expect all kitchens to put some effort into sourcing and display a little creativity no matter how limited the resources. That we do owes a little bit to 'ino.","320":"Most people, asked to identify the most universal shift in law enforcement over the past 15 years, would likely think of militarization, calls for community policing, or perhaps the slow decline of \"broken windows\".<\/p><p>But from the turn of the millennium to date, arguably no development has been more widespread in law enforcement than the adoption of so called \"less-lethal\" electric control devices (ECD), which many people know by the name of their most prolific manufacturer: Taser International. The company currently supplies their weapons to 17,800 of the United States' roughly 18,000 law enforcement agencies.<\/p><p>The brand name Taser has become as synonymous with these devices as Kleenex or Xerox have to photocopies and tissues \u2013 a quirk of language known as a \"proprietary eponym\". The word has even become a verb, as people commonly speak of being \"Tased\" or \"Tasered\".<\/p><p>The word Taser, though, didn't start with the company: it's actually a loose acronym of the book Tom Swift and His Electric Rifle. Jack Cover, the inventor of the modern ECD, named his prototype after the YA sci-fi novel he loved, and the very idea for a less-lethal electric gun was largely inspired by the fictional one described in the book.<\/p><p>And while this quirky history is known among some in law enforcement and engineering circles, the innocence with which it's told \u2013 a curious inventor culling inspiration from the literature of his youth \u2013 belies a more sinister truth: the book itself is boldly racist.<\/p><p>Tom Swift and His Electric Rifle, published in New York in 1911 under the pen name Victor Appleton, is typical of the literature of its time: an imperialist adventure tale set against the backdrop of a wild and dark African continent. In it, the protagonist, Tom Swift, develops an electric rifle \u2013 a totally novel idea in 1911 \u2013 and decides to test it in Africa in the hunt for ivory.<\/p><p>Africa, in the context of the book, exists only as a frontier of underexploited resources ripe for the wealth accumulation of white men daring enough to attempt. \"Elephant shooting in Africa! My! With my new electric rifle ... what a fellow couldn't do in the dark continent!\"<\/p><p>\"With the price of ivory soaring,\" says Swift's veteran hunting companion, \"there's a chance for us all to get a lot of money.\"<\/p><p>While this unabashed entrepreneurial imperialism tends to read as a relic of a bygone age, today disproportionately white police departments in places like Ferguson, Missouri, often function similarly as the adventurers sent to do the dangerous work of this kind of wealth generation. Like in the book, black communities are often seen not as dynamic places where people live lives, but as sites for plunder.<\/p><p>Take, for example, the Department of Justice's March report on the prevalence of predatory, revenue-based policing in St Louis County: entire municipalities there, as elsewhere in the US, float their operating budgets and justify their own existence on the racially biased extraction of statutory fees from primarily black residents. This scheme has only begun to decline because of the protests and organizing that defined Ferguson in the wake of Mike Brown's death.<\/p><p>In the book, as in America today, the black people are rendered as either passive, simple and childlike, or animalistic and capable of unimaginable violence. They are described in the book at various points as \"hideous in their savagery, wearing only the loin cloth, and with their kinky hair stuck full of sticks\", and as \"wild, savage and ferocious ... like little red apes\".<\/p><p>Swift and his travel companions quickly determine the blacks, scarcely human, need to be controlled, guided or killed as determined by the more \"civilized\" white outsiders.<\/p><p>Consider then how quickly the black people of Ferguson were rendered something less than fully human in the wake of Mike Brown's killing: an on-duty Ferguson police officer, a former NYPD commissioner and a popular actor all spared no time in invoking the discourse of \"animals\" in reference to black protesters. Near and far, incredulous commentators sought to cast the police as the sole defenders of black communities, and the only thing standing between those communities and self-destruction.<\/p><p>\"White police officers wouldn't be there if you weren't killing each other,\" former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani said on Meet the Press last November. Echoing Swift's rank paternalism, he later added: \"I probably saved more black lives as mayor of New York City than any mayor in the history of this city.\"<\/p><p>In the book, when Swift and his companions proudly use their advanced weapons \u2013 particularly the electric rifle \u2013 to dispatch with an incoming buffalo stampede, they too happily celebrate themselves as saviors.<\/p><p>\"Had it not been for the white men, the native village, which consisted of only frail huts, would have been completely wiped out by the animals,\" the novel reads.<\/p><p>Being named after a racist book doesn't make a company or device racist, any more than a person being named after a racist relative makes them so. A name is just that \u2013 and a Taser on its face is no more racist than the city or state of Washington are, simply for being named after our slaveholding first president.<\/p><p>But as recent campus activism in places such as Harvard and Princeton have demonstrated, there is real value in coming to terms with the bigotry embedded in the seemingly innocuous names and symbols of even our most ordinary, and aspirationally colorblind, institutions.<\/p><p>Being aware of the history of the word Taser should make us pause and consider that, every day, predominantly white police officers walk into predominantly black communities armed with weapons first imagined in a book in which \"civilized\" whites entered the black wilds for the purpose of plunder, only to cast themselves as the saviors of the natives. It isn't meaningless that today that sequence sometimes appears to persist in reverse.","321":"Kenneth Ng calls his website a primer for tourists headed to<\/p><p>, but Fodor's it ain't.<\/p><p>The California State University at Northridge professor's site is a one-stop shop for men drawn to the country's sex tourism industry. Dotted with pictures of scantily clad women, the website, BigBabyKenny, advises would-be Johns on the art of negotiating with prostitutes. \"Start with a compliment,\" Ng advises.<\/p><p>Needless to say, Ng's website is causing headaches for Northridge administrators. First publicized by the Los Angeles Daily News, the economics professor's site has drawn a wave of unwelcome attention, forcing administrators to at once criticize its content and defend Ng's right to publish freely on his own time without university resources.<\/p><p>\"Until we find representative evidence that it infringes upon the work he does at the university itself, there's not much we can do about it,\" said Harold Hellenbrand, Northridge's provost.<\/p><p>There may be subtlety in Hellenbrand's words, but his message is clear: If BigBabyKenny infringes on Ng's ability to effectively do his job, then Northridge's position will change. Ng has already said his site is run through a separate server not connected to the university, but Northridge officials might still make a case that the site has interfered with his job. Asked if students complaining that they were no longer comfortable in Ng's class would compel Northridge to demand the site be taken down, Hellenbrand said \"I'm not inviting complaints, but you just hit on the key issue.\"<\/p><p>\"If [running the site is] what he wants to do, and at the same time he wants to educate students and students flock away, then that would create a problem,\" Hellenbrand said.<\/p><p>How Ng came to be identified as the author of BigBabyKenny is a story in itself. A frequent tourist of Thailand, Ng took to blogging on the website of a Bangkok bar called Big Mango Bar. In one controversial post, Ng advised men to seek women near a particular Buddhist shrine.<\/p><p>\"The naysayers will say its creepy to be hanging around the Muariti Shrine, hitting on the emotionally vulnerable girls desperately praying and paying Buddha for a better love life but I beg to differ. Buddha works in mysterious ways,\" he wrote.<\/p><p>Perturbed by the post, the bar owners removed it. That led Ng to start his own site, prompting what Ng describes as a concerted effort by the owners to publicize his penchant for writing about prostitutes. They sent mass e-mails to faculty listed in Northridge's directory, and also posted on RateMyProfessor.com, warning students about Ng, he said.<\/p><p>Ng readily defends the content of his site and says he has no intention of taking it down.<\/p><p>\"The university has no stake in this one way or the other, and besides, professors can say whatever they want,\" said Ng, a tenured associate professor of economics.<\/p><p>Some question whether Ng has crossed a gray legal line, however, by advising men on sex tourism. Patrick Trueman, a former U.S. justice department official, notes that there are several federal statutes that could come into play. Within U.S. Code 18 are two sections \u2013 2422 (a) and 2422 (b) \u2013 that specifically prohibit anyone from \"enticing or coercing a person\" to travel internationally in pursuit of prostitutes. Moreover, one section specifically prohibits the use of the Internet to lure people.<\/p><p>While prostitution may be tolerated in Thailand, that's immaterial under the federal code, Trueman said.<\/p><p>\"Inducing and enticing? Isn't that what this guy's doing?\" said Trueman, former chief of the Justice Department's Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section in the Criminal Division.<\/p><p>Trueman, now a lawyer specializing in sex trafficking and child abuse cases, said there would likely be debate about whether talking about procuring prostitutes online and actually arranging prostitutes for a person should be treated differently under the law.<\/p><p>\"Given how lax the fed government is on these crimes, they may not charge somebody unless they are more directly involved,\" he said. \"That's not to say this person couldn't be charged, and as I read it they could be charged.\"<\/p><p>Beyond the legal implications, critics have already attacked Ng on moral grounds. John Foubert, an Oklahoma State University professor who researches sex trafficking, argues that women \u2013 often minors \u2013 are forced into the sex tourism industry and often have trouble escaping it. Even if Ng is operating within the bounds of the law, Northridge officials have an ethical problem they've yet to face, Foubert said.<\/p><p>\"Do they want to live with the blood on their hands of these girls that are being essentially raped by these men, who are going down and purchasing sex? I think that's a larger question,\" said Foubert, an associate professor of college student development.<\/p><p>Ng said he allows anything to be written on his site, so long as it doesn't involve pedophilia or underage sex. He does, however, write about how difficult it is to effectively negotiate with a \"half or sometimes fully naked teenage girl\" when she's \"expertly gyrating\" on a man's lap.<\/p><p>While his critics have been speaking out since fall, Ng said he has yet to hear from a student who expressed discomfort about his website.<\/p><p>\"The job of the university is to expose students to the world \u2013 not just a politically correct view of the world and not just the good parts of the world,\" he said. \"If a student reads that [site], I personally think it's good for them. They learn about something out there; maybe they disapprove of it and they don't think it's good.\"<\/p><p>You share in the USA TODAY community, so please keep your comments smart and civil.

The American people rejected that, and Republicans shouldn't be doubling down on it.\"<\/p><p>The White House effort comes three days before Obama releases his 2014 budget, which is expected to include a mix of tax increases and cuts to such entitlements as Social Security and Medicare.<\/p><p>\"You can do both,\" Pfeiffer said on ABC's \"This Week.\" \"That's what you'll see. \u2026 What we won't do is cut our way to prosperity.\"<\/p><p>However, the outline of the plan has already been criticized by Republicans and some of the president's staunchest supporters.<\/p><p>The release of the budget Wednesday, which will be followed by Obama meeting for dinner with Senate Republicans, is just part of a busy week in Washington.<\/p><p>Congress returns from a two-week break with the Senate attempting to reach a bipartisan agreement on immigration-reform legislation, and the leaders of the Democrat-controlled chamber trying to finish a gun-control proposal that might or might not include the contentious universal background checks for buyers.<\/p><p>Pfeiffer told Fox the meeting with Senate Republicans is simply an attempt to find a \"caucus of common sense,\" not end run leaders of the Republican-controlled House.<\/p><p>Last week, House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, said Obama's budget blueprint holds reforms \"hostage\" to tax increases.

We're beginning to set the stage for the grand bargain.\"<\/p><p>Among the highlights of the president's plan is spending cuts and tax increases that would reduce the deficit by $1.8 trillion over 10 years, replacing the $1.2 trillion in automatic spending cuts, known as sequester, over the same period.<\/p><p>The proposal also is expected to include new spending for public works projects, early education and job training, as well as $580 billion in new taxes that Republicans oppose.<\/p><p>Counting reductions and higher taxes that Congress and Obama have approved since 2011, the 2014 budget would contribute $4.3 trillion to total deficit reduction by 2023.<\/p><p>On Saturday, the president said his budget was not his \"ideal plan,\" but it was a compromise that he would be willing to accept.<\/p><p>The House and Senate have already passed their own budget plans.

When the shoebox-shaped and nearly shoebox-size panini shop opened on Bedford Street 15 years ago, there was nothing quite like it in New York, a restaurant that kept things simple and kept prices low, serving flavorful food in a room that was just adorable enough that you could decide, midmeal, that maybe the two of you squeezed into the counter were there on a date, and not just grabbing a bite.<\/p><p>You have to fire up the Wayback Machine to better understand how 'ino helped change how this city eats. Fifteen years ago, New York was a bistro town. There was the old guard: Blue Ribbon, Le Gamin, Jules, Lucky Strike, Raoul's and a dozen others. Then in 1997, a newcomer opened in SoHo named Balthazar, which raised the stakes with its set direction and unlisted reservation line. Balthazar was white-hot: it had perfectly distressed mirrors, fresh and crusty bread, and although it was impossible to get a table unless you knew somebody who knew somebody, you could always go at midnight and eat at the bar.<\/p><p>Soon, New York was lousy with bistros. It was a good era if you wanted a kir, steak frites, escargot, fris\u00e9e lardon, profiteroles. Authenticity, or some version of it, was the point. Everybody was pressing butter into little ramekins to be served at room temperature, changing the paper covering the tablecloths before serving dessert.<\/p><p>Honestly, it was really fun. The restaurants were lively, intimate, sexy. So what if you could recite the menu before you set foot in the door? But if you were a young chef with a measure of vision and creativity, you were stuck either making onion soup and beet salad with goat cheese. Or you worked on the line executing the vision and creativity of an older chef in Midtown or TriBeCa. Prune hadn't yet opened. Neither had Diner. Brooklyn didn't have much of a food scene outside the restaurant row on Smith Street, which was anchored by Patois, a bistro. If you went to Williamsburg, it was to go to a party or to go dancing, not to eat. This was the landscape when Jason and Jennifer Denton opened 'ino on a quiet street in the West Village. The kitchen in the back was the size of a D.J. booth and used the technology of induction burners, which was novel at the time: it was a paninoteca that looked as if it belonged in New York rather than being shipped, tile by mirrored tile, from Milan.<\/p><p>The culinary vocabulary was Italian, but it wasn't sepia-toned and sentimental. Instead, there was a focus on ingredients at a time when, in New York at least, few people cared. It had simple food done well, and sometimes you encountered flavors that weren't lifted out of the songbook. I still have a 13-year-old memory of sharing a shredded duck sandwich with sweet relish, a combination that is about as authentically Italian as a functioning parliament. You could go to 'ino to get something familiar (prosciutto and cheese will never get old), but you could also try something new.<\/p><p>'Ino was a casual joint with integrity, an easygoing place where you could eat well as long as you didn't mind the wait. Today, we take this combination for granted, and expect all kitchens to put some effort into sourcing and display a little creativity no matter how limited the resources. That we do owes a little bit to 'ino.","327":"By DEXTER FORDMAY 9, 2014<\/p><p>MALIBU, CALIF. \u2014 Good luck, America, with your efforts to pigeonhole the BMW i8.<\/p><p>The car is a post-petroleum brand statement. It's a sci-fi showpiece. It's an ultralight carbon-fiber production car. It's a triumph of parts-bin engineering. It's a take-no-prisoners canyon racer. It's a winged chariot of the Malibu \u00fcber-chic. It's a $136,625 (destination included!) commuter car for Silicon Valley moguls.<\/p><p>The hardware, at least, is straightforward. The central passenger shell is a stiff, lightweight carbon-fiber structure. It is bolted to an aluminum skeleton that holds the 7.1-kilowatt-hour lithium-ion battery pack in its spine.<\/p><p>An electric drive section similar to the one in the BMW i3 people pod is bolted to the front, its 131 horsepower electric motor and 2-speed automatic transmission driving the front wheels. The rear power package is sourced from the new Mini; its 3-cylinder, twin-turbocharged 231-horsepower engine drives the rear wheels through a 6-speed automatic transmission.<\/p><p>The multilayered skin is molded thermoplastic that weighs half as much as steel. Other extreme weight-saving measures, including aluminum wiring and chemically hardened ultrathin glass, keep the weight to 3,267 pounds. The long, light doors swing up and forward. From the front, with doors open, the i8 looks as if it's signaling a touchdown.<\/p><p>The interior is compact yet comfortable, though those over 6-foot-2 may need more legroom, and the rear seats are designed for tiny, limber people.<\/p><p>Getting in is a challenge. The sill is wide, the seat is low, and there's a trick: sit sideways, slide butt in, retract legs. Getting out? Imagine climbing from a bathtub without using your hands.<\/p><p>Pick a personality with the driving-mode buttons. \"Comfort\" keeps the car in electric mode to 37 m.p.h., or until you mash the right-side pedal.

Within six weeks of the firing on Fort Sumter, Gen. Benjamin Butler was forced to decide what to do with three slaves who escaped to Fortress Monroe on the north shore of Virginia's James River. Butler, certainly no abolitionist, nonetheless refused to return the three to their owner, labeling them \"contrabands of war.\"<\/p><p>The term, suitably ambiguous for an administration that as yet had no policy on how to handle the fugitives, found immediate acceptance. As one Union officer wrote, \"Never was a word so speedily adopted by so many people in so short a time.\" Within weeks hundreds of \"contrabands\" \u2014 men, women and children \u2014 flocked to Fortress Monroe and other Union Army positions. Unsure what might greet them, the escaped slaves were yet confident that life under federal control must surely represent an improvement.<\/p><p>It took the federal government more than a year to devise a policy in answer to this thirst for freedom. In August 1861, the First Confiscation Act stripped slaveholders of their claim of ownership, but it failed to clarify whether the slaves were themselves free. The following March Congress prohibited the military from sending escaped slaves back into slavery, and in July the Second Confiscation Act decreed that all slaves that took refuge in Union areas were \"captives of war\" and would be set free.<\/p><p>These legislative actions took on ever greater significance as Union forces moved deeper and deeper into Confederate territory. The growing number of contrabands reaching federal lines necessitated the establishment of dozens of impromptu contraband camps. A draft map compiled by the National Park Service illustrates how the network of these generally transitory camps mirrored the advance of the Union Army along the Mississippi, Tennessee and Cumberland River systems. Grant's Army of the Tennessee spent the summer of 1862 protecting supply lines in western Tennessee and northern Mississippi. Victories at the Battle of Iuka in September and the Battle of Corinth in early October solidified Union control of the area.<\/p><p>Lincoln's announcement of the preliminary Emancipation Proclamation on Sept. 22, 1862, produced an even greater flood of refugees. How best to use and care for these contrabands proved particularly vexing for military leaders under Grant's command. \"You have no idea of the consternation Old Abe's Proclamation is making,\" wrote Gen. Grenville Dodge to his brother in September. The contrabands \"will not even wait until 1st January. I do not know what we shall do with them.\"<\/p><p>Many of these fugitives arrived in an appalling condition. \"There were men, women, and children in every stage of disease or decrepitude often nearly naked, with flesh torn by the terrible experiences of their escape,\" wrote one observer. \"Often the slaves met prejudices against their color more bitter than any they had left behind.\"<\/p><p>On Nov. 11, 1862, Grant took the first step toward addressing the crisis: he named John Eaton, a former high school principal and chaplain of the 27th Ohio Infantry, as superintendent of contrabands and set him at work \"organizing them into suitable companies for working.\" A month later he went further. \"The negroes will be clothed, and in every way provided for, out of their earnings\" \u2014 about 12.5 cents for each pound of cotton picked \u2014 \"so far as practicable,\" he ordered. \"In no case will negroes be forced into the service of the Government, or be enticed away from their homes except when it becomes a military necessity.\"<\/p><p>Grant's policies lent the contraband camps an official status and began to define what a freedman could and could not do once within the Union lines. Personally, Grant appears to have had no particular sympathy for the refugees. He seems to have recognized that, in the words of one observer, \"The soldiers of our army were a good deal opposed to serving the Negro in any manner.\" Nevertheless, the Union commander unreservedly supported Eaton's work and in the process enabled the creation of one of the war's most successful contraband camps, located at Corinth, Miss.<\/p><p>Although formally organized under the direction of General Dodge in early December 1862 and placed under the command of James M. Alexander, chaplain of the 66th Illinois, the Corinth camp likely came into existence as early as September. Initially housed in army tents no longer considered serviceable for Union troops, the freedmen were soon set to work downing trees and clearing land on which to build cabins and lay out streets, which were named for Union generals. Eventually the freedmen also built a four-room school, a commissary, a hospital, a church and an office. The entire camp was divided into wards, complete with ward masters and a police force.<\/p><p>In late 1862 the American Missionary Association sent its first volunteers to Corinth to help care for, educate and minister to the freedmen. In a memoir written years after the war, one such missionary recalled her experience. \"When brought face to face with the slaves,\" she wrote, \"it was like the discovery of a new race.\" The men and women who came to Corinth generally shared a paternalistic optimism and viewed the freedmen as childlike in their enthusiasm for both education and salvation.<\/p><p>The freedmen's thirst for knowledge was undeniable. \"You will find them every hour of daylight, at their books,\" observed the Rev. Edward Pierce in March of 1863. \"We cannot enter a cabin, or tent, but that we see from one to three with books.\" Within no time Pierce and his wife had more than 150 students, and by the end of the summer, the addition of more missionaries enabled the school to accommodate between 300 and 400 children as well as 60 adults at a night school. In August, one of the teachers estimated that as many as 1,000 freedmen had learned to read in the Corinth camp.<\/p><p>Organized religion followed closely on the heels of formal education. Reverend Olds \"saw an earnestness in reference to the Christian life that I have seldom seen. And as I saw their deep earnestness & heard their hearty responses,\" he said, \"I was led to ask where can we find a more impressible people than these?\"<\/p><p>The population of the camp fluctuated between 1,500 and 6,000, as large groups undertook assignments for the Union Army or contracted to work on local plantations. In March 1863, for example, the camp was home to 658 men, 1,440 women and 1,559 children. Among the men were 36 blacksmiths, 48 carpenters, 180 teamsters and 200 cooks. The female ranks included 80 seamstresses, 150 laundresses and 600 cooks. Two-thirds of the men and three-quarters of the women were married, and seven in eight women had children. According to John Eaton's records, the camp had experienced 900 cases of illness, 189 deaths and 45 births.<\/p><p>Life at Corinth changed dramatically after a May 1863 visit by Adj. Gen. Lorenzo Thomas, who was intent on recruiting thousands of contrabands for his newly formed black regiments. With the organization of the 1st Alabama Infantry of African Descent, later renamed the 55th United States Colored Troops, the camp lost most of its able-bodied men.<\/p><p>Their departure to fight left only the women, the young, the old and the infirm to carry on Eaton's ambitious agricultural program, which rested on the cooperative farming of large tracts of abandoned and confiscated land. The program put 400 acres under cultivation, 300 for cotton and 100 for vegetables. Each cabin also had its own subsistence garden. By May 1863, the success of the agricultural program and the presence of a multitude of skilled artisans produced a clear monthly profit of $4,000 to $5,000 for the government, as well as an admirably independent community that Eaton hoped might serve as a model for other camps.<\/p><p>Unfortunately, the success of the Corinth camp proved short-lived. Plans for a winter campaign by Union forces in January 1864 provided a grim reminder that the fate of the freedmen was always secondary to the triumph of the Union cause. The order to relocate the camp's inhabitants 93 miles westward, to Memphis, \"fell like a bomb-shell among our contented people,\" lamented one missionary, \"but military orders are preemptory,\" and they \"must be obeyed.\" The freedmen left their \"well-organized village,\" gardens and farms to tdiv><\/p><p>The move from Corinth destroyed the spirit that had animated the freedmen's success. Some of the new refugees found work on confiscated plantations or in Memphis, but most lived in one of several camps surrounding the city.<\/p><p>\"The destruction of the Corinth camp,\" noted one historian, \"was one of the tragedies of the Civil War.\" Eaton's plan for large-scale cooperative farming fell victim to a bitter struggle between the War and Treasury departments over the leasing of plantations and was never implemented elsewhere. And no more than one or two other camps were able to replicate the strong civilian leadership, well-planned and policed living environment, and emphasis on education that made Corinth a success.<\/p><p>Had the government learned from the model fashioned in northern Mississippi between the fall of 1862 and early 1864, the newly freed slaves might well have enjoyed a far easier transition to life in postwar America.<\/p><p>Sources: Joseph E.

It's been nearly two decades since pictures of this sort were produced with any regularity by the studio system, and a lot longer since they were stateside successes. Many of the attempts in recent years have been, at best, mid-budget passion projects with circumscribed audiences (Stallone's own<\/p><p>which topped out at $42 million domestically) or post-modern winks (the French-language \"JCVD\" from 2008, a hostage movie in which Jean-Claude Van Damme plays a version of himself). The few large-scale attempts, like \"The A-Team,\" underperformed. (The biceps-and-bullets remake grossed $77 million domestically, a number that will likely be easily surpassed by \"The Expendables.\")<\/p><p>But the Stallone picture -- with its hard-charging, take-no-prisoners patriotism unbothered by the vagaries of the real world (it takes place in a fictional country, for starters) and its caricature of freedom-hating enemies (\"We will kill this American disease,\" as the TV spot enticed us) -- planted itself squarely in the old-school genre. And this weekend, the movie showed that there's life in that category yet. That \"Scott Pilgrim vs. the World,\" the tongue-in-cheek, pop-culture-referential, decidedly 2010 creation -- the one for, of and by arch fanboys -- trailed well behind \"The Expendables\" only drove home the point more loudly.<\/p><p>On one hand, it's understandable that a movie of easy American heroism (OK, first-world Western heroism) would catch on. In fact, it's surprising it didn't happen sooner. Apple-pie-patriotism already is behind the success of a cable news network and supports large sections of the contemporary country music industry. Why not a film hit too?<\/p><p>But among all the factors to which one might point in explaining the success of \"The Expendables\" -- a cast harvested from so many demographics and eras; a moviegoer backlash to 3-D and CG effects -- it somehow doesn't feel that the demand for neat heroes and villains is one of them.<\/p><p>Norris and his ilk would submit that in our current period of ideological and geopolitical upheaval, in a time of blurry lines between enemies and friends in places such as Afghanistan and Iraq, that black-and-white heroes slake a patriotic thirst (and that, indeed, the movie-going world can support a lot more of them). But history argues the opposite: Those movies succeed when the culture at large is filled with clear-cut distinctions. On the other hand, when the zeitgeist is more cloudy, an entirely different kind of cinema prospers.<\/p><p>The post-WWII era and its mainly straightforward distinctions between good and evil, to take an example of the former, yielded a flowering subgenre of movies with morally uncomplicated gunslingers. And 30 years later, the ideological simplicity of the Cold War and its larger-than-life Evil Empire gave rise to the very action movies on which \"Expendables\" is modeled (not to mention the ultimate in us-versus-them confections, \"Rocky IV.\" Yes, there's a Stallone-ishness to all of this). There are plenty of reasons why these types of movies faded from view in the 1990s, but the fall of the Berlin Wall and the the Soviet Union certainly played a part.<\/p><p>The examples are just as abundant on the other side. The ambiguities of the Vietnam War and the counterculture in the late 1960s and early 1970s undoubtedly offered up the moral murkiness of<\/p><p>\"Midnight Cowboy\" and scores of others. In the post-9\/11 world, meanwhile, movies like<\/p><p>-- with its themes of a destruction-bent enemy that can't be bargained with, and the question of what constitutes an acceptable ethical compromise in fighting that enemy -- have captured our imagination. You can throw<\/p><p>in there too, to the degree the movie was a contemplation of Western interests in the Middle East.<\/p><p>Political eras are, of course, rarely just one thing or another, and the movies we want to see in a given period are hardly monolithic. But as tempting as it is to infer that the success of \"The Expendables\" shows a deeper cultural need, it may well be the wrong inference. When times are confusing, we want movies to reflect that confusion, and even to make sense of it. But we probably don't want to pretend that confusion doesn't exist.<\/p><p>Photo: A scene from \"The Expendables.\" Credit: Lionsgate<\/p><p>Stallone: I'm contemplating an \"Expendables\" sequel<\/p><p>Hollywood wonders if Schwarzenegger will be back","331":"While living in an apartment in Pentagon City, Stephanie Gimenez Stahlberg and her husband, Patrick Stahlberg, a software engineer, began searching for a house where they could raise their family.<\/p><p>With two children \u2014 now 31\/2 and 1 1\/2 \u2014 the Stahlbergs needed more space, including a study area for Stephanie, who is enrolled in a PhD program at the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies.<\/p><p>The house they found in Cherrydale, a neighborhood in North Arlington, met their expectations.

She also served as curator and director of the Arlington Historical Museum and editor of the Cherrydale Citizens' Association newsletter.<\/p><p>Single-family homes, the Arlington public schools, access to bike trails and proximity to the District draw people to the neighborhood. Sometimes, though, they move in but stay only a few years. Finding a house in Cherrydale can involve the competitive process the Stahlbergs experienced.<\/p><p>About half a mile north of the Virginia Square and Ballston Metro stations on the Orange and Silver lines, Cherrydale has a variety of residences ranging from farmhouses to bungalows to Sears and Montgomery Ward kit homes with two to five or bedrooms or sometimes more.

Since 1908, the Cherrydale Citizens' Association has planned activities and resolved neighborhood concerns. In the 1970s and 1980s, people often referred to the neighborhood as Mayberry, according to Springston, 63. In 1948, her parents bought the house where she lives with her husband and son. It dates to 1890, Springston said.<\/p><p>In the neighborhood, 49 properties sold in the past year, according to Billy Buck, an associate broker at Buck & Associates. The lowest priced was a one-bedroom, one-bath condominium for $200,000; the highest priced was a five-bedroom, five-bath farmhouse at $1.63 million.

When the shoebox-shaped and nearly shoebox-size panini shop opened on Bedford Street 15 years ago, there was nothing quite like it in New York, a restaurant that kept things simple and kept prices low, serving flavorful food in a room that was just adorable enough that you could decide, midmeal, that maybe the two of you squeezed into the counter were there on a date, and not just grabbing a bite.<\/p><p>You have to fire up the Wayback Machine to better understand how 'ino helped change how this city eats. Fifteen years ago, New York was a bistro town. There was the old guard: Blue Ribbon, Le Gamin, Jules, Lucky Strike, Raoul's and a dozen others. Then in 1997, a newcomer opened in SoHo named Balthazar, which raised the stakes with its set direction and unlisted reservation line. Balthazar was white-hot: it had perfectly distressed mirrors, fresh and crusty bread, and although it was impossible to get a table unless you knew somebody who knew somebody, you could always go at midnight and eat at the bar.<\/p><p>Soon, New York was lousy with bistros. It was a good era if you wanted a kir, steak frites, escargot, fris\u00e9e lardon, profiteroles. Authenticity, or some version of it, was the point. Everybody was pressing butter into little ramekins to be served at room temperature, changing the paper covering the tablecloths before serving dessert.<\/p><p>Honestly, it was really fun. The restaurants were lively, intimate, sexy. So what if you could recite the menu before you set foot in the door? But if you were a young chef with a measure of vision and creativity, you were stuck either making onion soup and beet salad with goat cheese. Or you worked on the line executing the vision and creativity of an older chef in Midtown or TriBeCa. Prune hadn't yet opened. Neither had Diner. Brooklyn didn't have much of a food scene outside the restaurant row on Smith Street, which was anchored by Patois, a bistro. If you went to Williamsburg, it was to go to a party or to go dancing, not to eat. This was the landscape when Jason and Jennifer Denton opened 'ino on a quiet street in the West Village. The kitchen in the back was the size of a D.J. booth and used the technology of induction burners, which was novel at the time: it was a paninoteca that looked as if it belonged in New York rather than being shipped, tile by mirrored tile, from Milan.<\/p><p>The culinary vocabulary was Italian, but it wasn't sepia-toned and sentimental. Instead, there was a focus on ingredients at a time when, in New York at least, few people cared. It had simple food done well, and sometimes you encountered flavors that weren't lifted out of the songbook. I still have a 13-year-old memory of sharing a shredded duck sandwich with sweet relish, a combination that is about as authentically Italian as a functioning parliament. You could go to 'ino to get something familiar (prosciutto and cheese will never get old), but you could also try something new.<\/p><p>'Ino was a casual joint with integrity, an easygoing place where you could eat well as long as you didn't mind the wait. Today, we take this combination for granted, and expect all kitchens to put some effort into sourcing and display a little creativity no matter how limited the resources. That we do owes a little bit to 'ino.","335":"Despite the firestorm over his comments about rape and pregnancy, Representative Todd Akin says he has no plans to drop out as the Republican Senate nominee in Missouri.<\/p><p>But what if he did?<\/p><p>The procedures in Missouri to change nominees midstream are complicated and intended to discourage just the sort of change that many in the Republican Party say they are eager to see happen.<\/p><p>\"As more time passes, you're starting to go up against deadlines,\" said Stacie Temple, a spokeswoman for Missouri's secretary of state, Robin Carnahan, a Democrat. Ms. Temple said the longer Mr. Akin waited, the more difficult it would get.<\/p><p>The first deadline for Mr. Akin to have easily withdrawn from the race was Tuesday evening. His decision to stay in the race means that he now has only a few weeks to reconsider before things get even harder.<\/p><p>Certification of the presidential ballots in Missouri will be no later than Sept. 17, and could be shortly after President Obama officially accepts the Democratic nomination on Sept. 5.<\/p><p>Once the ballots are printed, any candidate who seeks to withdraw must pay for the reprinting of new ballots. That could be prohibitively expensive for Mr. Akin, but presumably the Republican Party \u2014 which badly wants him to withdraw \u2014 would cover the cost.<\/p><p>Military overseas ballots begin shipping out Sept. 22. That might be the first firm deadline. But the drop-dead deadline is Sept. 25, when general absentee ballots are sent out.<\/p><p>Mel Carnahan, the former Missouri governor and Ms. Carnahan's father, died on Oct. 16, 2000, during his campaign for the Senate against the Republican incumbent, John Ashcroft. Mr. Carnahan's name nonetheless appeared on the ballot in November \u2014 and he won. (His widow, Jean, was appointed to the seat, and lost it in special election in 2002.)<\/p><p>Assuming that Mr. Akin bows to pressure from Republican leaders (or simply concludes that he isn't able to raise enough money to mount a credible campaign), Missouri law requires that he seek a court order allowing him to drop out of the race.<\/p><p>State officials say that issuing such court orders is routine. Mr. Akin would merely have to file the necessary papers with the court and his name would no longer be printed on the November ballot. Republicans could then quickly nominate someone else to run against Senator Claire McCaskill, the Democratic incumbent.<\/p><p>Democrats would no doubt like to see Mr. Akin \u2014 now politically weakened by his comments on rape and pregnancy \u2014 stay in the race. In theory, the Democratic officials who run the state's election offices could object to Mr. Akin's request for a court order, a move that would force a hearing before a judge.<\/p><p>The relevant statute says someone like Mr. Akin can withdraw \"pursuant to a court order, which, except for good cause shown by the election authority in opposition thereto, shall be freely given upon application by the candidate to the circuit court in the county of such candidate's residence.\"<\/p><p>Election officials say they can find no precedent at all for such an objection in the state's history. But Ms. Carnahan is herself a factor in Republican minds. As the Democratic Senate nominee in 2010, she lost to Representative Roy Blunt, and Republicans imagine she could put up a fight.<\/p><p>\"The secretary's job is to protect the rights of Missouri voters,\" Ms. Temple said when asked whether Ms. Carnahan would fight a court order to remove Mr. Akin's name from the ballot.<\/p><p>A further complication: Under state law, any election authority in Missouri can oppose a withdrawal order, down to the county and city level, and there are Democrats aplenty in Missouri. But Ms. Temple added that right now, it would be up to a Missouri court to determine whether Mr. Akin could withdraw, not the secretary of state.<\/p><p>\"It's completely in the hands of the court to decide the facts,\" she said.<\/p><p>Assuming Mr. Akin does manage to drop out, the state central committee of the Republican Party in Missouri would have to pick a new candidate within 28 days, or by Oct. 12, whichever comes first.","336":"While living in an apartment in Pentagon City, Stephanie Gimenez Stahlberg and her husband, Patrick Stahlberg, a software engineer, began searching for a house where they could raise their family.<\/p><p>With two children \u2014 now 31\/2 and 1 1\/2 \u2014 the Stahlbergs needed more space, including a study area for Stephanie, who is enrolled in a PhD program at the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies.<\/p><p>The house they found in Cherrydale, a neighborhood in North Arlington, met their expectations. Within two days on the market, however, there were 10 offers. \"Our was not the highest,\" Stephanie said. \"We wrote a letter to the owners about why we liked the house.\"<\/p><p>The letter, along with a photograph of the family, worked. What drew the Stahlbergs to the house were the solar panels and the trees and bushes \u2014 raspberries, blueberries, blackberries, strawberries, grapes, apples, plums and currants \u2014 growing organically on the property. The Stahlbergs also envisioned finishing the basement bedroom and bathroom for an au pair.<\/p><p>They also fell in love with the neighborhood. They would be within walking distance to a park and two libraries with story time for children.<\/p><p>\"We were trying to look at homes where we can walk to the Metro, or bike to the city or to the Metro,\" said Stephanie, 27.<\/p><p>Sears and Montgomery Ward kit houses: Cherrydale, once abundant with cherry orchards, is a family neighborhood dating to 1893. While many neighbors have lived in the area for as long as 60 years, newcomers move in and out these days, said Kathryn Holt Springston, who worked for the Smithsonian American History Tours Office as an educational specialist and historian for 28 years. She also served as curator and director of the Arlington Historical Museum and editor of the Cherrydale Citizens' Association newsletter.<\/p><p>Single-family homes, the Arlington public schools, access to bike trails and proximity to the District draw people to the neighborhood. Sometimes, though, they move in but stay only a few years. Finding a house in Cherrydale can involve the competitive process the Stahlbergs experienced.<\/p><p>About half a mile north of the Virginia Square and Ballston Metro stations on the Orange and Silver lines, Cherrydale has a variety of residences ranging from farmhouses to bungalows to Sears and Montgomery Ward kit homes with two to five or bedrooms or sometimes more. Many date from 1900 to 1930, though some of the older houses were purchased to be torn down and replaced with larger homes, including some built as recently as this year.<\/p><p>Living there: Cherrydale lies north of Interstate 66 and south of Lorcom Lane, stretching roughly from Utah Street on the west to the northward-curving interstate on the east. The Maywood neighborhood claims the eastern half of those boundaries north of Lee Highway, lending something of an arrowhead shape to Cherrydale. Since 1908, the Cherrydale Citizens' Association has planned activities and resolved neighborhood concerns. In the 1970s and 1980s, people often referred to the neighborhood as Mayberry, according to Springston, 63. In 1948, her parents bought the house where she lives with her husband and son. It dates to 1890, Springston said.<\/p><p>In the neighborhood, 49 properties sold in the past year, according to Billy Buck, an associate broker at Buck & Associates. The lowest priced was a one-bedroom, one-bath condominium for $200,000; the highest priced was a five-bedroom, five-bath farmhouse at $1.63 million. Twelve properties are on the market now, ranging from a one-bedroom, two-bath condo for $274,900 to a new five-bedroom, five-bath Craftsman house at $1.799 million.<\/p><p>Welcome wagon: The five-points intersection \u2014 Lee Highway, Old Dominion Drive, Quincy Street, Military Road and Quebec Street \u2014 is dotted with at least two car dealerships and other commercial establishments while nearby is a Safeway and the Cherrydale Hardware, which opened in 1938.<\/p><p>The Cherrydale Volunteer Fire House, built in 1919, is home to such events as the annual spaghetti dinner, concerts and for 90 years each December there is a visit from Santa Claus for children under 12. Other community events are the annual Fourth of July party and picnic at 21st and Stafford streets. A neighborhood with its own \"welcome wagon,\" Cherrydale has approximately 1,400 households and three parks as well as the Martha Custis Trail for biking, running and walking.<\/p><p>Schools: Glebe Elementary, Taylor Elementary, Swanson Middle, Kenmore Middle and Washington-Lee High.<\/p><p>Transit: The neighborhood is close to the Virginia Square or Ballston Metro stops on the Orange and Silver lines.

The company currently supplies their weapons to 17,800 of the United States' roughly 18,000 law enforcement agencies.<\/p><p>The brand name Taser has become as synonymous with these devices as Kleenex or Xerox have to photocopies and tissues \u2013 a quirk of language known as a \"proprietary eponym\". The word has even become a verb, as people commonly speak of being \"Tased\" or \"Tasered\".<\/p><p>The word Taser, though, didn't start with the company: it's actually a loose acronym of the book Tom Swift and His Electric Rifle. Jack Cover, the inventor of the modern ECD, named his prototype after the YA sci-fi novel he loved, and the very idea for a less-lethal electric gun was largely inspired by the fictional one described in the book.<\/p><p>And while this quirky history is known among some in law enforcement and engineering circles, the innocence with which it's told \u2013 a curious inventor culling inspiration from the literature of his youth \u2013 belies a more sinister truth: the book itself is boldly racist.<\/p><p>Tom Swift and His Electric Rifle, published in New York in 1911 under the pen name Victor Appleton, is typical of the literature of its time: an imperialist adventure tale set against the backdrop of a wild and dark African continent. In it, the protagonist, Tom Swift, develops an electric rifle \u2013 a totally novel idea in 1911 \u2013 and decides to test it in Africa in the hunt for ivory.<\/p><p>Africa, in the context of the book, exists only as a frontier of underexploited resources ripe for the wealth accumulation of white men daring enough to attempt. \"Elephant shooting in Africa! My! With my new electric rifle ... what a fellow couldn't do in the dark continent!\"<\/p><p>\"With the price of ivory soaring,\" says Swift's veteran hunting companion, \"there's a chance for us all to get a lot of money.\"<\/p><p>While this unabashed entrepreneurial imperialism tends to read as a relic of a bygone age, today disproportionately white police departments in places like Ferguson, Missouri, often function similarly as the adventurers sent to do the dangerous work of this kind of wealth generation. Like in the book, black communities are often seen not as dynamic places where people live lives, but as sites for plunder.<\/p><p>Take, for example, the Department of Justice's March report on the prevalence of predatory, revenue-based policing in St Louis County: entire municipalities there, as elsewhere in the US, float their operating budgets and justify their own existence on the racially biased extraction of statutory fees from primarily black residents. This scheme has only begun to decline because of the protests and organizing that defined Ferguson in the wake of Mike Brown's death.<\/p><p>In the book, as in America today, the black people are rendered as either passive, simple and childlike, or animalistic and capable of unimaginable violence. They are described in the book at various points as \"hideous in their savagery, wearing only the loin cloth, and with their kinky hair stuck full of sticks\", and as \"wild, savage and ferocious ... like little red apes\".<\/p><p>Swift and his travel companions quickly determine the blacks, scarcely human, need to be controlled, guided or killed as determined by the more \"civilized\" white outsiders.<\/p><p>Consider then how quickly the black people of Ferguson were rendered something less than fully human in the wake of Mike Brown's killing: an on-duty Ferguson police officer, a former NYPD commissioner and a popular actor all spared no time in invoking the discourse of \"animals\" in reference to black protesters. Near and far, incredulous commentators sought to cast the police as the sole defenders of black communities, and the only thing standing between those communities and self-destruction.<\/p><p>\"White police officers wouldn't be there if you weren't killing each other,\" former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani said on Meet the Press last November. Echoing Swift's rank paternalism, he later added: \"I probably saved more black lives as mayor of New York City than any mayor in the history of this city.\"<\/p><p>In the book, when Swift and his companions proudly use their advanced weapons \u2013 particularly the electric rifle \u2013 to dispatch with an incoming buffalo stampede, they too happily celebrate themselves as saviors.<\/p><p>\"Had it not been for the white men, the native village, which consisted of only frail huts, would have been completely wiped out by the animals,\" the novel reads.<\/p><p>Being named after a racist book doesn't make a company or device racist, any more than a person being named after a racist relative makes them so. A name is just that \u2013 and a Taser on its face is no more racist than the city or state of Washington are, simply for being named after our slaveholding first president.<\/p><p>But as recent campus activism in places such as Harvard and Princeton have demonstrated, there is real value in coming to terms with the bigotry embedded in the seemingly innocuous names and symbols of even our most ordinary, and aspirationally colorblind, institutions.<\/p><p>Being aware of the history of the word Taser should make us pause and consider that, every day, predominantly white police officers walk into predominantly black communities armed with weapons first imagined in a book in which \"civilized\" whites entered the black wilds for the purpose of plunder, only to cast themselves as the saviors of the natives. It isn't meaningless that today that sequence sometimes appears to persist in reverse.","339":"\"We don't want people coming back or visiting,\" Nugent said.

With Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, Connie Nielsen, Oliver Reed. Directed by Ridley Scott. At area theaters. Running time: 154 mins. Rated R: Gory violence, incest theme. 3 1\/2 Stars.<\/p><p>If there's a soft spot in your heart for the sword-&-sandal epic - and from the star rating above, I think you can guess where I stand - then you'll swoon with giddy delight over \"Gladiator,\" a sweaty, stylish hunkfest that takes you back to the days of \"Ben-Hur,\" \"Spartacus\" and the so recently departed Steve Reeves.<\/p><p>From his biceps to his gluteus, Maximus is maximus. This Roman general turned slave turned gladiator hasn't a shred of humor, but then, he doesn't have time for idle nonsense when he's lopping off heads all day. (The head-lopping is apparently his signature, like the mark of Zorro.)<\/p><p>In director Ridley Scott's thrilling, burnished epic, Maximus no sooner serves the empire by leveling Germania during a snowstorm than Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) tosses him a promotion he doesn't want - to succeed the aged emperor and whip Rome back into shape. All Maximus wants is to go home to his wife and child in the suburbs.<\/p><p>The careworn Russell Crowe is physically and temperamentally perfect for the part of Maximus. Still carrying some of the weight he packed on for \"The Insider,\" he's no gym-toned pretty boy. He's solid, beefy, rough-hewn, creaking along in his heavy leather costume, with a look on his puss of weary disdain.<\/p><p>What makes him sexy is his sense of honor and loyalty: \"What we do in life echoes in eternity!\" Anyway, it can't be his hygiene, although he is frequently bathed in a sanctifying golden glow.<\/p><p>After a coup by the emperor's weak-kneed son, Commodus (a whiny, surprisingly fleshy Joaquin Phoenix), Maximus' fortunes change. He winds up being thrown to the tigers, two shows daily, in Rome's Colosseum, the entertainment complex of its day.<\/p><p>Crowe, like his character, must grimly come to terms with the fact that, actor or gladiator, it's all about showmanship. Give the crowd what it wants, either at the multiplex or in the arena, and you can write your own ticket.<\/p><p>\"I have power only to amuse the mob,\" he spits contemptuously like a Shakespearean actor reduced to dinner theater.<\/p><p>The plot, about avenging honor, provides brief respite between an array of hand-to-hand battles that are pitched so furiously that individual components barely register; they're subliminal suggestions of computer-assisted carnage, with Jackson Pollock sprays of blood. For fans of the genre, yes, this is a good thing.<\/p><p>Connie Nielsen plays Commodus' sister and possible love interest for Maximus once his family is dispatched (politics, you know). Nielsen's costumes are laced up like bondage gear, and there is a tantalizing hint of romance past.<\/p><p>But the camera only has eyes for Crowe. The glowering! The seething! The hooded gaze! The quiet suffering! (Watch him carve away a tattoo he no longer has use for. No anesthetic! No disinfectant!)<\/p><p>The supporting cast makes for a gauntlet of worthy friends and adversaries, all of them thinkers, including Derek Jacobi (\"I, Claudius\") as a senator, Djimon Hounsou (\"Amistad\") as a fellow gladiator and Oliver Reed, who died with two days to go on the shoot, looking a little woozy as a gladiator entrepreneur.<\/p><p>Reed's character is the one most in touch with the movie's premise - that entertainment is the goal, and a worthy one at that.","341":"12\/28\/2015 AT 04:50 PM EST<\/p><p>Like a lot of professional funny people, Beth Stelling is used to getting candid about her life offstage.

Scared of what people will think, scared it makes me look weak or unprofessional,\" she writes.<\/p><p>\"When friends or comics ask why we broke up, it's not easy or comfortable to reply; it doesn't seem like the appropriate thing to say at a stand-up show, a party or a wedding. It's embarrassing. I feel stupid. After being verbally, physically abused and raped, I dated him for two more months. It's not simple.\"<\/p><p>Ultimately, Stelling couldn't exclude such a significant piece of her story from her onstage persona, even if it meant risking ridicule from the close-knit comedy community.<\/p><p>\"After I broke up with him, he said, 'You're very open and honest in your stand-up, and I just ask that you consider me when you talk about your ex because everyone knows who you're talking about.' And I abided. I wrote vague jokes because we both live in L.A., and I didn't want to hurt him, start a war, press charges, be interrogated or harassed by him or his friends and family. I wanted to move on and forget because I didn't understand,\" Stelling shares.<\/p><p>\"I don't want revenge or to hurt him now, but it's unhealthy to keep this inside because my stand-up is pulled directly from my life.

Small businesses and families starving for credit will eventually get relief as the funding props up banks and they increase lending, but Rajoy didn't offer guidance on when.<\/p><p>Spain on Saturday became the fourth \u2014 and largest \u2014 of the 17 countries that use Europe's common currency to request a bailout \u2014 a big blow to a nation that a few years ago took pride as the continent's economic superstar only to see it become the hot spot in the eurozone debt crisis. Its economy is the eurozone's fourth largest after Germany, France and Italy.<\/p><p>Across the country, Spaniards reacted with a mixture of anger and relief to the news. The amount of the rescue fund, if all is tapped, amounts to \u20ac21,000 of new debt for each person in the nation of 47 million where the average annual salary for those with work is about the same amount and the unemployment rate for those under age 25 is 52 percent.<\/p><p>The country is already reeling from deep austerity cuts Rajoy has imposed over the last six months that have raised taxes, made it easier to hire and fire workers, and cut deep into cherished government programs including education and national health care.<\/p><p>\"It's obviously a shame,\" said civil servant Luisa Saraguren, 44, as she strolled on a sunny Sunday morning with her young daughter. \"But this bailout was fully predictable, and the consequences of this help are going to be a lot bigger compared to the cuts we've been living with already.\"<\/p><p>Rajoy took pains to avoid the word bailout Sunday, saying Spain's rescue package is a line of credit that its most troubled banks will be able to tap. The assistance will not come with the outside control over government macroeconomic policy like that imposed Greece, Ireland and Portugal when their public finances were bailed out.<\/p><p>He said interest rates on the loans will be considerably lower than the rate near 7 percent that Spain has been forced to pay recently on the international debt markets, a level that forced the other countries to seek bailouts.<\/p><p>Spain will regain the economic credibility it has lost by shoring up its banks, which will result in credit being restored so businesses and individuals shut off from loans can start borrowing and the economy will grow again, Rajoy insisted, again without saying when.<\/p><p>Europe's widening recession and financial crisis has hurt companies and investors around the world. Providing a financial lifeline to Spanish banks is likely to relieve anxiety on the Spanish economy \u2014 which is five times larger than Greece's \u2014 and on markets concerned about the country's ability to pay its way.<\/p><p>Spain's financial problems are not due to Greek-style government over-spending. The country's banks particularly its savings banks or \"cajas,\" got caught up in the collapse of a real estate bubble in 2008 that got worse over the past four years. However, as Spain's leaders have struggled for a solution to their banking crisis, the country's borrowing costs have soared close to the level that forced the governments of Greece, Portugal and Ireland to seek rescues.<\/p><p>Some of Spain's banks are struggling with by toxic real estate loans and assets amid fears the problem will get worse as more jobless people can't pay their mortgages. The Bank of Spain says the toxic loans and assets total around \u20ac180 billion. Nationalized lender Bankia SA, which has requested \u20ac19 billion in aid, has \u20ac32 billion in toxic assets. Around four other banks serving the domestic market are considered prime candidates for bailouts.<\/p><p>\"I could never get my mind round the scale of consumption in Spain over the past 20 years, having known it in the 1960s when it was still extremely poor,\" said Paul Preston, a history professor and expert on Spain with the London School of Economics. \"Lots of people enjoyed the consumer boom, but not everybody. Now everybody's having to pay for it.\"<\/p><p>Rajoy blamed Spain's woes on the previous Socialist administration of Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero without mentioning him or his government by name. Zapatero was ousted by Rajoy in a landslide last November by voters outraged over the Socialist handling of the economy.<\/p><p>\"Last year Spain's public administration spent \u20ac90 billion more than it took in, this can't be maintained, we can't live like that,\" Rajoy said.<\/p><p>But Socialist Party leader Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba said Rajoy should acknowledge that Spain is now in bailout territory.<\/p><p>\"The government is trying to make us believe that we've won the lottery, that the Three Kings of Orient have arrived, and that isn't so,\" Rubalcaba said.<\/p><p>After his press conference, Rajoy defended his decision to jet off an hour later to Poland to see Spain's famed national football team take on Italy in the Euro 2012 competition. He said he would be on the ground in Gdansk only for the game before flying back to Madrid Sunday night.<\/p><p>\"I'll be there two and a half hours and then I'll leave,\" Rajoy said. \"I think the national team deserves it.\"","346":"Most people, asked to identify the most universal shift in law enforcement over the past 15 years, would likely think of militarization, calls for community policing, or perhaps the slow decline of \"broken windows\".<\/p><p>But from the turn of the millennium to date, arguably no development has been more widespread in law enforcement than the adoption of so called \"less-lethal\" electric control devices (ECD), which many people know by the name of their most prolific manufacturer: Taser International. The company currently supplies their weapons to 17,800 of the United States' roughly 18,000 law enforcement agencies.<\/p><p>The brand name Taser has become as synonymous with these devices as Kleenex or Xerox have to photocopies and tissues \u2013 a quirk of language known as a \"proprietary eponym\". The word has even become a verb, as people commonly speak of being \"Tased\" or \"Tasered\".<\/p><p>The word Taser, though, didn't start with the company: it's actually a loose acronym of the book Tom Swift and His Electric Rifle. Jack Cover, the inventor of the modern ECD, named his prototype after the YA sci-fi novel he loved, and the very idea for a less-lethal electric gun was largely inspired by the fictional one described in the book.<\/p><p>And while this quirky history is known among some in law enforcement and engineering circles, the innocence with which it's told \u2013 a curious inventor culling inspiration from the literature of his youth \u2013 belies a more sinister truth: the book itself is boldly racist.<\/p><p>Tom Swift and His Electric Rifle, published in New York in 1911 under the pen name Victor Appleton, is typical of the literature of its time: an imperialist adventure tale set against the backdrop of a wild and dark African continent. In it, the protagonist, Tom Swift, develops an electric rifle \u2013 a totally novel idea in 1911 \u2013 and decides to test it in Africa in the hunt for ivory.<\/p><p>Africa, in the context of the book, exists only as a frontier of underexploited resources ripe for the wealth accumulation of white men daring enough to attempt. \"Elephant shooting in Africa! My! With my new electric rifle ... what a fellow couldn't do in the dark continent!\"<\/p><p>\"With the price of ivory soaring,\" says Swift's veteran hunting companion, \"there's a chance for us all to get a lot of money.\"<\/p><p>While this unabashed entrepreneurial imperialism tends to read as a relic of a bygone age, today disproportionately white police departments in places like Ferguson, Missouri, often function similarly as the adventurers sent to do the dangerous work of this kind of wealth generation. Like in the book, black communities are often seen not as dynamic places where people live lives, but as sites for plunder.<\/p><p>Take, for example, the Department of Justice's March report on the prevalence of predatory, revenue-based policing in St Louis County: entire municipalities there, as elsewhere in the US, float their operating budgets and justify their own existence on the racially biased extraction of statutory fees from primarily black residents. This scheme has only begun to decline because of the protests and organizing that defined Ferguson in the wake of Mike Brown's death.<\/p><p>In the book, as in America today, the black people are rendered as either passive, simple and childlike, or animalistic and capable of unimaginable violence. They are described in the book at various points as \"hideous in their savagery, wearing only the loin cloth, and with their kinky hair stuck full of sticks\", and as \"wild, savage and ferocious ... like little red apes\".<\/p><p>Swift and his travel companions quickly determine the blacks, scarcely human, need to be controlled, guided or killed as determined by the more \"civilized\" white outsiders.<\/p><p>Consider then how quickly the black people of Ferguson were rendered something less than fully human in the wake of Mike Brown's killing: an on-duty Ferguson police officer, a former NYPD commissioner and a popular actor all spared no time in invoking the discourse of \"animals\" in reference to black protesters. Near and far, incredulous commentators sought to cast the police as the sole defenders of black communities, and the only thing standing between those communities and self-destruction.<\/p><p>\"White police officers wouldn't be there if you weren't killing each other,\" former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani said on Meet the Press last November. Echoing Swift's rank paternalism, he later added: \"I probably saved more black lives as mayor of New York City than any mayor in the history of this city.\"<\/p><p>In the book, when Swift and his companions proudly use their advanced weapons \u2013 particularly the electric rifle \u2013 to dispatch with an incoming buffalo stampede, they too happily celebrate themselves as saviors.<\/p><p>\"Had it not been for the white men, the native village, which consisted of only frail huts, would have been completely wiped out by the animals,\" the novel reads.<\/p><p>Being named after a racist book doesn't make a company or device racist, any more than a person being named after a racist relative makes them so. A name is just that \u2013 and a Taser on its face is no more racist than the city or state of Washington are, simply for being named after our slaveholding first president.<\/p><p>But as recent campus activism in places such as Harvard and Princeton have demonstrated, there is real value in coming to terms with the bigotry embedded in the seemingly innocuous names and symbols of even our most ordinary, and aspirationally colorblind, institutions.<\/p><p>Being aware of the history of the word Taser should make us pause and consider that, every day, predominantly white police officers walk into predominantly black communities armed with weapons first imagined in a book in which \"civilized\" whites entered the black wilds for the purpose of plunder, only to cast themselves as the saviors of the natives. It isn't meaningless that today that sequence sometimes appears to persist in reverse.","347":"The Coworking Resources Series is supported by join.me.

Even if you're not usually outgoing, try to make a special effort for the first week or two when you start in a new coworking space.<\/p><p>\"Just make introductions and it goes a long way\u2026We've had some people they wish they had met sooner because it turns out they did similar lines of work and just talking about it or actually sharing work, it's not something you want to find out when you only have a couple more months left on your project or something,\" Park says.<\/p><p>If you're shy about meeting people, try getting creative (like, for instance, bringing food). Bill Jacobson and Dave Ulrich, who co-founded WorkBar, said that one new coworker at WorkBar Boston showed up with a big box of doughnuts. \"He got to know everybody pretty quick,\" Jacobson says.<\/p><p>Don't stop interacting with your coworkers after you introduce yourself. One of the biggest benefits of coworking is the built-in community of professionals working across different industries.<\/p><p>\"It may not seem directly 'productive' to chat with your coworker for 10 minutes mid-day, but indirectly, it yields greater results than almost anything else you could spend time on,\" says Parker Whitney, office manager for Philadelphia coworking space Independents Hall, though he says, \"Invest in your community by taking (not faking) interest in what its members do, and it will take you with it\u2026The people you've always wanted to know are sitting all around you.

(Sarah Parnass\/The Washington Post)<\/p><p>The House Select Committee on Blumenthal, as some are now calling it, came to order at 10 a.m. Lawmakers didn't finish questioning Hillary Clinton until 11 hours later \u2014 just after the Democratic presidential candidate succumbed to a coughing fit.<\/p><p>In that period of time, the name of Sidney Blumenthal was invoked more than 75 times, and scores of questions were asked about the longtime Clinton friend. By lunchtime, Blumenthal had been invoked 49 times \u2014 exactly the number of mentions of J. Christopher Stevens, the ambassador to Libya whose death in Benghazi is the supposed subject of the congressional probe. The other three Americans slain in Benghazi \u2014 Sean Smith, Glen Doherty, Tyrone Woods \u2014 got seven or eight mentions apiece, then-CIA director David Petraeus and former defense secretary Robert Gates each got two, and then-Defense Secretary Leon Panetta had none.<\/p><p>Dana Milbank writes about political theater in the nation's capital. He joined the Post as a political reporter in 2000.<\/p><p>Chairman Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.), reading from Blumenthal's e-mails to Clinton as if he were the teacher who had intercepted a note passed between two high school kids, said Blumenthal referred to Gates as \"a mean, vicious little\"\u2014 Gowdy paused. \"I'm not going to say the word, but he did.\"<\/p><p>He also quoted Blumenthal referring to then- national security adviser Thomas E. Donilon's \"babbling rhetoric,\" and he said Blumenthal had referred to \"Obama\" (he \"left the 'president' part out\") and \"his political cronies in the White House and Chicago.\"<\/p><p>Clinton refused to get riled. \"I don't know what this line of questioning does to help us get to the bottom of deaths of four Americans,\" she said.<\/p><p>But Gowdy knew. A couple of minutes later, he announced: \"I'll tell you what: If you think you've heard about Sidney Blumenthal so far, wait until the next round.\"<\/p><p>He and his colleagues made good on that statement, posing questions on a Blumenthal visit to Clinton's home, about his work for the Clinton Foundation, his business interests, his attempt to get a job at the State Department and his communication with the former secretary of state over matters as mundane as her new iPad. They were particularly concerned with whether Blumenthal's advice to Clinton on Libya was \"unsolicited.\"<\/p><p>The Blumenthal focus shows that, after 17 months of probing Clinton, the Benghazi committee hasn't come up with much. Blumenthal has been a Clinton hatchet man for years, and he has an unsavory reputation. The very mention of his name (he was prominent during the Monica Lewinsky scandal) lends a whiff of skulduggery to any situation.<\/p><p>But injecting Blumenthal as a central character in the Benghazi probe doesn't help Republicans demonstrate that Clinton did wrong. And the justification for invoking him \u2014 to demonstrate that Clinton had more contact with him than with Stevens \u2014 is a stretch. Whatever else one thinks of the former journalist \u2014 I've clashed with him over the years \u2014 he had nothing to do with what happened in Libya on Sept. 11 and 12, 2012.<\/p><p>Rep. Mike Pompeo (R-Kan.) acted as if he had found a video of Blumenthal attacking the compound himself. Pompeo, who had previously made the false allegation that Clinton got \"most of her intelligence\" on Libya from Blumenthal, asked whether Stevens had Clinton's personal e-mail, her cellphone number, fax or home address or visited her at home. \"Mr. Blumenthal had each of those and did each of those things,\" Pompeo concluded.<\/p><p>Rep. Peter J. Roskam (R-Ill.) thought he saw a smoking gun in an e-mail correspondence from August 2011 in which Blumenthal encouraged Clinton to \"make a public statement before the cameras\" when Libyan leader Moammar Gaddafi was deposed.<\/p><p>\"Two months before the end of the Gaddafi regime and you're already planning on how to make your statement dramatic to maximize political gain,\" Roskam scolded.<\/p><p>Relevance to the Benghazi attack? None.<\/p><p>Gowdy, for his part, found it damning that Clinton aides passed along some of Blumenthal's advice (which he got from a former intelligence official) to people including Stevens. \"It's relevant because our ambassador was asked to read and respond to Sidney Blumenthal's drivel,\" the chairman said, \"in some instances on the very same day he was asking for security.\"<\/p><p>Rep. Adam B. Schiff (Calif.), a Democrat, observed that for all the time the panel has spent on Blumenthal, you'd think \"that he was in Benghazi on the night, manning the barricades.\" During private testimony from Blumenthal, to which he was summoned by federal marshals, Republicans asked more than 160 questions about Blumenthal's associations with Bill and Hillary Clinton but fewer than 20 about the Benghazi attacks.<\/p><p>Schiff and Rep.

(Sarah Parnass\/The Washington Post)<\/p><p>The House Select Committee on Blumenthal, as some are now calling it, came to order at 10 a.m. Lawmakers didn't finish questioning Hillary Clinton until 11 hours later \u2014 just after the Democratic presidential candidate succumbed to a coughing fit.<\/p><p>In that period of time, the name of Sidney Blumenthal was invoked more than 75 times, and scores of questions were asked about the longtime Clinton friend. By lunchtime, Blumenthal had been invoked 49 times \u2014 exactly the number of mentions of J. Christopher Stevens, the ambassador to Libya whose death in Benghazi is the supposed subject of the congressional probe. The other three Americans slain in Benghazi \u2014 Sean Smith, Glen Doherty, Tyrone Woods \u2014 got seven or eight mentions apiece, then-CIA director David Petraeus and former defense secretary Robert Gates each got two, and then-Defense Secretary Leon Panetta had none.<\/p><p>Dana Milbank writes about political theater in the nation's capital. He joined the Post as a political reporter in 2000.<\/p><p>Chairman Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.), reading from Blumenthal's e-mails to Clinton as if he were the teacher who had intercepted a note passed between two high school kids, said Blumenthal referred to Gates as \"a mean, vicious little\"\u2014 Gowdy paused. \"I'm not going to say the word, but he did.\"<\/p><p>He also quoted Blumenthal referring to then- national security adviser Thomas E. Donilon's \"babbling rhetoric,\" and he said Blumenthal had referred to \"Obama\" (he \"left the 'president' part out\") and \"his political cronies in the White House and Chicago.\"<\/p><p>Clinton refused to get riled. \"I don't know what this line of questioning does to help us get to the bottom of deaths of four Americans,\" she said.<\/p><p>But Gowdy knew. A couple of minutes later, he announced: \"I'll tell you what: If you think you've heard about Sidney Blumenthal so far, wait until the next round.\"<\/p><p>He and his colleagues made good on that statement, posing questions on a Blumenthal visit to Clinton's home, about his work for the Clinton Foundation, his business interests, his attempt to get a job at the State Department and his communication with the former secretary of state over matters as mundane as her new iPad. They were particularly concerned with whether Blumenthal's advice to Clinton on Libya was \"unsolicited.\"<\/p><p>The Blumenthal focus shows that, after 17 months of probing Clinton, the Benghazi committee hasn't come up with much. Blumenthal has been a Clinton hatchet man for years, and he has an unsavory reputation. The very mention of his name (he was prominent during the Monica Lewinsky scandal) lends a whiff of skulduggery to any situation.<\/p><p>But injecting Blumenthal as a central character in the Benghazi probe doesn't help Republicans demonstrate that Clinton did wrong. And the justification for invoking him \u2014 to demonstrate that Clinton had more contact with him than with Stevens \u2014 is a stretch. Whatever else one thinks of the former journalist \u2014 I've clashed with him over the years \u2014 he had nothing to do with what happened in Libya on Sept. 11 and 12, 2012.<\/p><p>Rep. Mike Pompeo (R-Kan.) acted as if he had found a video of Blumenthal attacking the compound himself. Pompeo, who had previously made the false allegation that Clinton got \"most of her intelligence\" on Libya from Blumenthal, asked whether Stevens had Clinton's personal e-mail, her cellphone number, fax or home address or visited her at home. \"Mr. Blumenthal had each of those and did each of those things,\" Pompeo concluded.<\/p><p>Rep. Peter J. Roskam (R-Ill.) thought he saw a smoking gun in an e-mail correspondence from August 2011 in which Blumenthal encouraged Clinton to \"make a public statement before the cameras\" when Libyan leader Moammar Gaddafi was deposed.<\/p><p>\"Two months before the end of the Gaddafi regime and you're already planning on how to make your statement dramatic to maximize political gain,\" Roskam scolded.<\/p><p>Relevance to the Benghazi attack? None.<\/p><p>Gowdy, for his part, found it damning that Clinton aides passed along some of Blumenthal's advice (which he got from a former intelligence official) to people including Stevens. \"It's relevant because our ambassador was asked to read and respond to Sidney Blumenthal's drivel,\" the chairman said, \"in some instances on the very same day he was asking for security.\"<\/p><p>Rep. Adam B. Schiff (Calif.), a Democrat, observed that for all the time the panel has spent on Blumenthal, you'd think \"that he was in Benghazi on the night, manning the barricades.\" During private testimony from Blumenthal, to which he was summoned by federal marshals, Republicans asked more than 160 questions about Blumenthal's associations with Bill and Hillary Clinton but fewer than 20 about the Benghazi attacks.<\/p><p>Schiff and Rep. Elijah E. Cummings (Md.), the ranking Democrat, proposed that Republicans, rather than selectively releasing Blumenthal's e-mails, come clean about their interest in him and make public the entire transcript of his testimony.

It's a sci-fi showpiece. It's an ultralight carbon-fiber production car. It's a triumph of parts-bin engineering. It's a take-no-prisoners canyon racer. It's a winged chariot of the Malibu \u00fcber-chic. It's a $136,625 (destination included!) commuter car for Silicon Valley moguls.<\/p><p>The hardware, at least, is straightforward. The central passenger shell is a stiff, lightweight carbon-fiber structure. It is bolted to an aluminum skeleton that holds the 7.1-kilowatt-hour lithium-ion battery pack in its spine.<\/p><p>An electric drive section similar to the one in the BMW i3 people pod is bolted to the front, its 131 horsepower electric motor and 2-speed automatic transmission driving the front wheels. The rear power package is sourced from the new Mini; its 3-cylinder, twin-turbocharged 231-horsepower engine drives the rear wheels through a 6-speed automatic transmission.<\/p><p>The multilayered skin is molded thermoplastic that weighs half as much as steel. Other extreme weight-saving measures, including aluminum wiring and chemically hardened ultrathin glass, keep the weight to 3,267 pounds. The long, light doors swing up and forward. From the front, with doors open, the i8 looks as if it's signaling a touchdown.<\/p><p>The interior is compact yet comfortable, though those over 6-foot-2 may need more legroom, and the rear seats are designed for tiny, limber people.<\/p><p>Getting in is a challenge. The sill is wide, the seat is low, and there's a trick: sit sideways, slide butt in, retract legs. Getting out? Imagine climbing from a bathtub without using your hands.<\/p><p>Pick a personality with the driving-mode buttons. \"Comfort\" keeps the car in electric mode to 37 m.p.h., or until you mash the right-side pedal. The eDrive button keeps things electric to 75 m.p.h. or until the battery fades.<\/p><p>Travel range is about 20 miles in E.V. mode, and recharging takes 1.5 hours at 240 volts or four hours at 120. The Eco-Pro button increases electric efficiency 20 percent by softening the motor response and optimizing climate-control settings. I observed gasoline-powered mileage figures from 27 m.p.g. (impatient cornering) to 37 m.p.g. (safe-and-sane commuting).<\/p><p>In the city, the i8 feels silent, solid and intuitive \u2014 the excitement happens outside, as gawkers track its progress.<\/p><p>On Los Angeles's well-used freeways, the Comfort setting leaves some comfort to be desired. Even with the variable dampers at full soft, the i8 bobs its nose like Muhammad Ali in the first rounds. High-performance tires come standard in the United States; European versions get narrower wheels and taller tires for lower drag and a smoother ride.<\/p><p>In Sport mode, the suspension and steering stiffen and the gas engine roars, pops on upshifts and matches revs downshifting into corners. It sounds great, and it should: much of what you hear is a prerecorded soundtrack piped through the sound system.<\/p><p>The i8 feels strong at full power, but the head-snapping response expected from a partly electric powertrain is absent. The i8 takes time to gather itself, with an atavistic vestige of turbo lag.<\/p><p>On the intestinal twists of Mulholland Highway the i8 can be driven with brutal abandon. The brakes are strong, the chassis is as stiff as a bank vault, and there's enough power to reach the next corner presently. BMW claims a 0-to-60 time of 4.2 seconds, and top speed is 155 m.p.h.<\/p><p>The front tires push when going hard into corners, but everything sticks coming out. Even with the stability control off, the i8 resists spinning its tires \u2014 the software ghost is still there, lurking in the machine.<\/p><p>The i8 is complicated and imperfect. A car that will be used for emissions-free commuting should allow people to get in and get out. It rides harshly. The exterior design is too clever \u2014 the layered rear deck whispers \"Your trunk is open.\"<\/p><p>Still, if the i8 represents the future of sports cars, things are looking bright.<\/p><p>A version of this review appears in print on May 11, 2014, on page AU4 of the New York edition with the headline: The Future Will See You Now.

Within six weeks of the firing on Fort Sumter, Gen. Benjamin Butler was forced to decide what to do with three slaves who escaped to Fortress Monroe on the north shore of Virginia's James River. Butler, certainly no abolitionist, nonetheless refused to return the three to their owner, labeling them \"contrabands of war.\"<\/p><p>The term, suitably ambiguous for an administration that as yet had no policy on how to handle the fugitives, found immediate acceptance. As one Union officer wrote, \"Never was a word so speedily adopted by so many people in so short a time.\" Within weeks hundreds of \"contrabands\" \u2014 men, women and children \u2014 flocked to Fortress Monroe and other Union Army positions. Unsure what might greet them, the escaped slaves were yet confident that life under federal control must surely represent an improvement.<\/p><p>It took the federal government more than a year to devise a policy in answer to this thirst for freedom. In August 1861, the First Confiscation Act stripped slaveholders of their claim of ownership, but it failed to clarify whether the slaves were themselves free. The following March Congress prohibited the military from sending escaped slaves back into slavery, and in July the Second Confiscation Act decreed that all slaves that took refuge in Union areas were \"captives of war\" and would be set free.<\/p><p>These legislative actions took on ever greater significance as Union forces moved deeper and deeper into Confederate territory. The growing number of contrabands reaching federal lines necessitated the establishment of dozens of impromptu contraband camps. A draft map compiled by the National Park Service illustrates how the network of these generally transitory camps mirrored the advance of the Union Army along the Mississippi, Tennessee and Cumberland River systems. Grant's Army of the Tennessee spent the summer of 1862 protecting supply lines in western Tennessee and northern Mississippi. Victories at the Battle of Iuka in September and the Battle of Corinth in early October solidified Union control of the area.<\/p><p>Lincoln's announcement of the preliminary Emancipation Proclamation on Sept. 22, 1862, produced an even greater flood of refugees. How best to use and care for these contrabands proved particularly vexing for military leaders under Grant's command. \"You have no idea of the consternation Old Abe's Proclamation is making,\" wrote Gen. Grenville Dodge to his brother in September. The contrabands \"will not even wait until 1st January. I do not know what we shall do with them.\"<\/p><p>Many of these fugitives arrived in an appalling condition. \"There were men, women, and children in every stage of disease or decrepitude often nearly naked, with flesh torn by the terrible experiences of their escape,\" wrote one observer. \"Often the slaves met prejudices against their color more bitter than any they had left behind.\"<\/p><p>On Nov. 11, 1862, Grant took the first step toward addressing the crisis: he named John Eaton, a former high school principal and chaplain of the 27th Ohio Infantry, as superintendent of contrabands and set him at work \"organizing them into suitable companies for working.\" A month later he went further. \"The negroes will be clothed, and in every way provided for, out of their earnings\" \u2014 about 12.5 cents for each pound of cotton picked \u2014 \"so far as practicable,\" he ordered. \"In no case will negroes be forced into the service of the Government, or be enticed away from their homes except when it becomes a military necessity.\"<\/p><p>Grant's policies lent the contraband camps an official status and began to define what a freedman could and could not do once within the Union lines. Personally, Grant appears to have had no particular sympathy for the refugees. He seems to have recognized that, in the words of one observer, \"The soldiers of our army were a good deal opposed to serving the Negro in any manner.\" Nevertheless, the Union commander unreservedly supported Eaton's work and in the process enabled the creation of one of the war's most successful contraband camps, located at Corinth, Miss.<\/p><p>Although formally organized under the direction of General Dodge in early December 1862 and placed under the command of James M. Alexander, chaplain of the 66th Illinois, the Corinth camp likely came into existence as early as September. Initially housed in army tents no longer considered serviceable for Union troops, the freedmen were soon set to work downing trees and clearing land on which to build cabins and lay out streets, which were named for Union generals. Eventually the freedmen also built a four-room school, a commissary, a hospital, a church and an office. The entire camp was divided into wards, complete with ward masters and a police force.<\/p><p>In late 1862 the American Missionary Association sent its first volunteers to Corinth to help care for, educate and minister to the freedmen. In a memoir written years after the war, one such missionary recalled her experience. \"When brought face to face with the slaves,\" she wrote, \"it was like the discovery of a new race.\" The men and women who came to Corinth generally shared a paternalistic optimism and viewed the freedmen as childlike in their enthusiasm for both education and salvation.<\/p><p>The freedmen's thirst for knowledge was undeniable. \"You will find them every hour of daylight, at their books,\" observed the Rev. Edward Pierce in March of 1863. \"We cannot enter a cabin, or tent, but that we see from one to three with books.\" Within no time Pierce and his wife had more than 150 students, and by the end of the summer, the addition of more missionaries enabled the school to accommodate between 300 and 400 children as well as 60 adults at a night school. In August, one of the teachers estimated that as many as 1,000 freedmen had learned to read in the Corinth camp.<\/p><p>Organized religion followed closely on the heels of formal education. Reverend Olds \"saw an earnestness in reference to the Christian life that I have seldom seen. And as I saw their deep earnestness & heard their hearty responses,\" he said, \"I was led to ask where can we find a more impressible people than these?\"<\/p><p>The population of the camp fluctuated between 1,500 and 6,000, as large groups undertook assignments for the Union Army or contracted to work on local plantations. In March 1863, for example, the camp was home to 658 men, 1,440 women and 1,559 children. Among the men were 36 blacksmiths, 48 carpenters, 180 teamsters and 200 cooks. The female ranks included 80 seamstresses, 150 laundresses and 600 cooks. Two-thirds of the men and three-quarters of the women were married, and seven in eight women had children. According to John Eaton's records, the camp had experienced 900 cases of illness, 189 deaths and 45 births.<\/p><p>Life at Corinth changed dramatically after a May 1863 visit by Adj. Gen. Lorenzo Thomas, who was intent on recruiting thousands of contrabands for his newly formed black regiments. With the organization of the 1st Alabama Infantry of African Descent, later renamed the 55th United States Colored Troops, the camp lost most of its able-bodied men.<\/p><p>Their departure to fight left only the women, the young, the old and the infirm to carry on Eaton's ambitious agricultural program, which rested on the cooperative farming of large tracts of abandoned and confiscated land. The program put 400 acres under cultivation, 300 for cotton and 100 for vegetables. Each cabin also had its own subsistence garden. By May 1863, the success of the agricultural program and the presence of a multitude of skilled artisans produced a clear monthly profit of $4,000 to $5,000 for the government, as well as an admirably independent community that Eaton hoped might serve as a model for other camps.<\/p><p>Unfortunately, the success of the Corinth camp proved short-lived. Plans for a winter campaign by Union forces in January 1864 provided a grim reminder that the fate of the freedmen was always secondary to the triumph of the Union cause. The order to relocate the camp's inhabitants 93 miles westward, to Memphis, \"fell like a bomb-shell among our contented people,\" lamented one missionary, \"but military orders are preemptory,\" and they \"must be obeyed.\" The freedmen left their \"well-organized village,\" gardens and farms to tdiv><\/p><p>The move from Corinth destroyed the spirit that had animated the freedmen's success. Some of the new refugees found work on confiscated plantations or in Memphis, but most lived in one of several camps surrounding the city.<\/p><p>\"The destruction of the Corinth camp,\" noted one historian, \"was one of the tragedies of the Civil War.\" Eaton's plan for large-scale cooperative farming fell victim to a bitter struggle between the War and Treasury departments over the leasing of plantations and was never implemented elsewhere. And no more than one or two other camps were able to replicate the strong civilian leadership, well-planned and policed living environment, and emphasis on education that made Corinth a success.<\/p><p>Had the government learned from the model fashioned in northern Mississippi between the fall of 1862 and early 1864, the newly freed slaves might well have enjoyed a far easier transition to life in postwar America.<\/p><p>Sources: Joseph E.

This is not going away.<\/p><p>But, Newt can turn his pas-de-deux on the loveseat with Nancy into an opportunity to promote a consistent and electable political message.<\/p><p>Because he will be asked about this at every turn, Newt will have the air time and the opportunity to tell the truth on climate change\u2014based upon real science\u2014and to interface it with a limited-government philosophy. The two are easy to do.<\/p><p>Start with the obvious. Instead of waffling on the subject, he could just point out that earth's surface temperature is about 1\u00b0C warmer than it was a century ago. There were two periods of warming, the first from about 1910 through 1945, and the second from the mid-1970s to the late-1990s. They were both roughly the same magnitude. Because the first one was long before we put the majority of fossil carbon into the atmosphere, Newt can say\u2014with scientific authority\u2014that the magnitude of 'natural' climate change is likely to be at least as large as what humans have done.<\/p><p>Then Newt should proceed to the future. It's not the heat, it's the sensitivity. How much it will warm in the future is a function of how sensitive the atmosphere is to doubling atmospheric carbon dioxide. There are a number of independent arguments now coming together showing that this value may have been overestimated. The reference for the most recent is a November issue of Science.<\/p><p>Next, a little refreshing honesty: in 2009, the House of Representatives passed a cap-and-trade bill (which the Senate did not) commanding that the average american\u201438 years from now\u2014be allowed the carbon dioxide emissions of the average citizen in 1867. Prior to its passage, Newt was undeniably for such a system. Newt could call that that the \"second dumbest thing\" he has done and be finished with it.<\/p><p>After setting the record straight, how about interjecting his own political philosophy? When asked what to do about global warming, he should give the honest answer: if the atmosphere indeed is not as sensitive to carbon dioxide changes as previously thought, the correct response is nothing.<\/p><p>That's because \"nothing\" really means something. Newt should channel his historian. When markets are free, capital supports innovation more efficiently than when they aren't. Think about the remarkable changes in energy and technology in the last 100 years. Isn't it rather obvious that the same will occur in the next century, if only we don't hinder capital development? Newt might even use the catchy saw (first sloganed by Northern Illinois Gas in 1972) the future belongs to the efficient, and that there are impressive market forces that advantage those who produce things efficiently or produce efficient things.<\/p><p>When the doomsayers say Newt is believing in a Deus ex machine to dramatically cut carbon dioxide emissions, he might point out that those were the same folks who, only a very few years ago, told us we were running out of natural gas. Innovation and capital revolutionized drilling and fracturing shale, and we now know we have literally hundreds of years of it under our feet. There are a lot more voters and delegates around the country who will benefit from the shale revolution than there are in ethanol-addicted Iowa.","356":"Disunion follows the Civil War as it unfolded.<\/p><p>The Lincoln administration may not have gone to war in 1861 to end slavery, but no one bothered to tell that to the slaves.

Unsure what might greet them, the escaped slaves were yet confident that life under federal control must surely represent an improvement.<\/p><p>It took the federal government more than a year to devise a policy in answer to this thirst for freedom. In August 1861, the First Confiscation Act stripped slaveholders of their claim of ownership, but it failed to clarify whether the slaves were themselves free. The following March Congress prohibited the military from sending escaped slaves back into slavery, and in July the Second Confiscation Act decreed that all slaves that took refuge in Union areas were \"captives of war\" and would be set free.<\/p><p>These legislative actions took on ever greater significance as Union forces moved deeper and deeper into Confederate territory. The growing number of contrabands reaching federal lines necessitated the establishment of dozens of impromptu contraband camps. A draft map compiled by the National Park Service illustrates how the network of these generally transitory camps mirrored the advance of the Union Army along the Mississippi, Tennessee and Cumberland River systems. Grant's Army of the Tennessee spent the summer of 1862 protecting supply lines in western Tennessee and northern Mississippi. Victories at the Battle of Iuka in September and the Battle of Corinth in early October solidified Union control of the area.<\/p><p>Lincoln's announcement of the preliminary Emancipation Proclamation on Sept. 22, 1862, produced an even greater flood of refugees. How best to use and care for these contrabands proved particularly vexing for military leaders under Grant's command. \"You have no idea of the consternation Old Abe's Proclamation is making,\" wrote Gen. Grenville Dodge to his brother in September. The contrabands \"will not even wait until 1st January. I do not know what we shall do with them.\"<\/p><p>Many of these fugitives arrived in an appalling condition. \"There were men, women, and children in every stage of disease or decrepitude often nearly naked, with flesh torn by the terrible experiences of their escape,\" wrote one observer. \"Often the slaves met prejudices against their color more bitter than any they had left behind.\"<\/p><p>On Nov. 11, 1862, Grant took the first step toward addressing the crisis: he named John Eaton, a former high school principal and chaplain of the 27th Ohio Infantry, as superintendent of contrabands and set him at work \"organizing them into suitable companies for working.\" A month later he went further. \"The negroes will be clothed, and in every way provided for, out of their earnings\" \u2014 about 12.5 cents for each pound of cotton picked \u2014 \"so far as practicable,\" he ordered. \"In no case will negroes be forced into the service of the Government, or be enticed away from their homes except when it becomes a military necessity.\"<\/p><p>Grant's policies lent the contraband camps an official status and began to define what a freedman could and could not do once within the Union lines. Personally, Grant appears to have had no particular sympathy for the refugees. He seems to have recognized that, in the words of one observer, \"The soldiers of our army were a good deal opposed to serving the Negro in any manner.\" Nevertheless, the Union commander unreservedly supported Eaton's work and in the process enabled the creation of one of the war's most successful contraband camps, located at Corinth, Miss.<\/p><p>Although formally organized under the direction of General Dodge in early December 1862 and placed under the command of James M. Alexander, chaplain of the 66th Illinois, the Corinth camp likely came into existence as early as September. Initially housed in army tents no longer considered serviceable for Union troops, the freedmen were soon set to work downing trees and clearing land on which to build cabins and lay out streets, which were named for Union generals. Eventually the freedmen also built a four-room school, a commissary, a hospital, a church and an office. The entire camp was divided into wards, complete with ward masters and a police force.<\/p><p>In late 1862 the American Missionary Association sent its first volunteers to Corinth to help care for, educate and minister to the freedmen. In a memoir written years after the war, one such missionary recalled her experience. \"When brought face to face with the slaves,\" she wrote, \"it was like the discovery of a new race.\" The men and women who came to Corinth generally shared a paternalistic optimism and viewed the freedmen as childlike in their enthusiasm for both education and salvation.<\/p><p>The freedmen's thirst for knowledge was undeniable. \"You will find them every hour of daylight, at their books,\" observed the Rev. Edward Pierce in March of 1863. \"We cannot enter a cabin, or tent, but that we see from one to three with books.\" Within no time Pierce and his wife had more than 150 students, and by the end of the summer, the addition of more missionaries enabled the school to accommodate between 300 and 400 children as well as 60 adults at a night school. In August, one of the teachers estimated that as many as 1,000 freedmen had learned to read in the Corinth camp.<\/p><p>Organized religion followed closely on the heels of formal education. Reverend Olds \"saw an earnestness in reference to the Christian life that I have seldom seen. And as I saw their deep earnestness & heard their hearty responses,\" he said, \"I was led to ask where can we find a more impressible people than these?\"<\/p><p>The population of the camp fluctuated between 1,500 and 6,000, as large groups undertook assignments for the Union Army or contracted to work on local plantations. In March 1863, for example, the camp was home to 658 men, 1,440 women and 1,559 children. Among the men were 36 blacksmiths, 48 carpenters, 180 teamsters and 200 cooks. The female ranks included 80 seamstresses, 150 laundresses and 600 cooks. Two-thirds of the men and three-quarters of the women were married, and seven in eight women had children. According to John Eaton's records, the camp had experienced 900 cases of illness, 189 deaths and 45 births.<\/p><p>Life at Corinth changed dramatically after a May 1863 visit by Adj. Gen. Lorenzo Thomas, who was intent on recruiting thousands of contrabands for his newly formed black regiments. With the organization of the 1st Alabama Infantry of African Descent, later renamed the 55th United States Colored Troops, the camp lost most of its able-bodied men.<\/p><p>Their departure to fight left only the women, the young, the old and the infirm to carry on Eaton's ambitious agricultural program, which rested on the cooperative farming of large tracts of abandoned and confiscated land. The program put 400 acres under cultivation, 300 for cotton and 100 for vegetables. Each cabin also had its own subsistence garden. By May 1863, the success of the agricultural program and the presence of a multitude of skilled artisans produced a clear monthly profit of $4,000 to $5,000 for the government, as well as an admirably independent community that Eaton hoped might serve as a model for other camps.<\/p><p>Unfortunately, the success of the Corinth camp proved short-lived. Plans for a winter campaign by Union forces in January 1864 provided a grim reminder that the fate of the freedmen was always secondary to the triumph of the Union cause. The order to relocate the camp's inhabitants 93 miles westward, to Memphis, \"fell like a bomb-shell among our contented people,\" lamented one missionary, \"but military orders are preemptory,\" and they \"must be obeyed.\" The freedmen left their \"well-organized village,\" gardens and farms to tdiv><\/p><p>The move from Corinth destroyed the spirit that had animated the freedmen's success. Some of the new refugees found work on confiscated plantations or in Memphis, but most lived in one of several camps surrounding the city.<\/p><p>\"The destruction of the Corinth camp,\" noted one historian, \"was one of the tragedies of the Civil War.\" Eaton's plan for large-scale cooperative farming fell victim to a bitter struggle between the War and Treasury departments over the leasing of plantations and was never implemented elsewhere. And no more than one or two other camps were able to replicate the strong civilian leadership, well-planned and policed living environment, and emphasis on education that made Corinth a success.<\/p><p>Had the government learned from the model fashioned in northern Mississippi between the fall of 1862 and early 1864, the newly freed slaves might well have enjoyed a far easier transition to life in postwar America.<\/p><p>Sources: Joseph E.

Fuel Tech also sells chemicals that are tossed into a coal burner to fight slag and thereby boost power plant efficiency.

Though coworking can have a lot of perks, how you take advantage of them and shape your experience is up to you.<\/p><p>\"We've had people who within the first week they've kind of immersed themselves [in]to events and socializing with other people here, or they're just here, they do their work, and then they take off,\" says Jeff Park, who manages the Ravenswood Coworking Group in Chicago. \"We know that they come in, but I think for them that's enough for them. They just want to be around other people in a productive environment.\"<\/p><p>Whether you're aiming to be as productive as possible without a lot of socializing or trying to build a strong professional community that you can turn to for resources and support, these five tips can help you get the most out of your coworking experience.<\/p><p>Green Spaces, a coworking space in Tribeca, specializes in environmentally focused businesses. Mountain View-based Cubes & Crayons combines childcare and coworking. WorkBar in Boston is hosted in a 2,500-square-foot space and has separate areas for cafe-like and quieter working styles. Coworking Brooklyn uses a small room that functions as an art gallery by night.<\/p><p>The coworking experience varies drastically depending on which space you're using. Different spaces have different levels of interaction with other workers, formality and general vibe. While some spaces, like Green Spaces and Cubes & Crayons, state their niche upfront, you'll only be able to gauge what the environment is like by dropping in. Most spaces have daily drop-in rates. Try a couple of different spaces to see what works best for you before you commit.

Even if you're not usually outgoing, try to make a special effort for the first week or two when you start in a new coworking space.<\/p><p>\"Just make introductions and it goes a long way\u2026We've had some people they wish they had met sooner because it turns out they did similar lines of work and just talking about it or actually sharing work, it's not something you want to find out when you only have a couple more months left on your project or something,\" Park says.<\/p><p>If you're shy about meeting people, try getting creative (like, for instance, bringing food). Bill Jacobson and Dave Ulrich, who co-founded WorkBar, said that one new coworker at WorkBar Boston showed up with a big box of doughnuts. \"He got to know everybody pretty quick,\" Jacobson says.<\/p><p>Don't stop interacting with your coworkers after you introduce yourself. One of the biggest benefits of coworking is the built-in community of professionals working across different industries.<\/p><p>\"It may not seem directly 'productive' to chat with your coworker for 10 minutes mid-day, but indirectly, it yields greater results than almost anything else you could spend time on,\" says Parker Whitney, office manager for Philadelphia coworking space Independents Hall, though he says, \"Invest in your community by taking (not faking) interest in what its members do, and it will take you with it\u2026The people you've always wanted to know are sitting all around you.

It's a sci-fi showpiece. It's an ultralight carbon-fiber production car. It's a triumph of parts-bin engineering. It's a take-no-prisoners canyon racer. It's a winged chariot of the Malibu \u00fcber-chic. It's a $136,625 (destination included!) commuter car for Silicon Valley moguls.<\/p><p>The hardware, at least, is straightforward. The central passenger shell is a stiff, lightweight carbon-fiber structure. It is bolted to an aluminum skeleton that holds the 7.1-kilowatt-hour lithium-ion battery pack in its spine.<\/p><p>An electric drive section similar to the one in the BMW i3 people pod is bolted to the front, its 131 horsepower electric motor and 2-speed automatic transmission driving the front wheels. The rear power package is sourced from the new Mini; its 3-cylinder, twin-turbocharged 231-horsepower engine drives the rear wheels through a 6-speed automatic transmission.<\/p><p>The multilayered skin is molded thermoplastic that weighs half as much as steel. Other extreme weight-saving measures, including aluminum wiring and chemically hardened ultrathin glass, keep the weight to 3,267 pounds. The long, light doors swing up and forward. From the front, with doors open, the i8 looks as if it's signaling a touchdown.<\/p><p>The interior is compact yet comfortable, though those over 6-foot-2 may need more legroom, and the rear seats are designed for tiny, limber people.<\/p><p>Getting in is a challenge. The sill is wide, the seat is low, and there's a trick: sit sideways, slide butt in, retract legs. Getting out? Imagine climbing from a bathtub without using your hands.<\/p><p>Pick a personality with the driving-mode buttons. \"Comfort\" keeps the car in electric mode to 37 m.p.h., or until you mash the right-side pedal. The eDrive button keeps things electric to 75 m.p.h. or until the battery fades.<\/p><p>Travel range is about 20 miles in E.V. mode, and recharging takes 1.5 hours at 240 volts or four hours at 120. The Eco-Pro button increases electric efficiency 20 percent by softening the motor response and optimizing climate-control settings. I observed gasoline-powered mileage figures from 27 m.p.g. (impatient cornering) to 37 m.p.g. (safe-and-sane commuting).<\/p><p>In the city, the i8 feels silent, solid and intuitive \u2014 the excitement happens outside, as gawkers track its progress.<\/p><p>On Los Angeles's well-used freeways, the Comfort setting leaves some comfort to be desired. Even with the variable dampers at full soft, the i8 bobs its nose like Muhammad Ali in the first rounds. High-performance tires come standard in the United States; European versions get narrower wheels and taller tires for lower drag and a smoother ride.<\/p><p>In Sport mode, the suspension and steering stiffen and the gas engine roars, pops on upshifts and matches revs downshifting into corners. It sounds great, and it should: much of what you hear is a prerecorded soundtrack piped through the sound system.<\/p><p>The i8 feels strong at full power, but the head-snapping response expected from a partly electric powertrain is absent. The i8 takes time to gather itself, with an atavistic vestige of turbo lag.<\/p><p>On the intestinal twists of Mulholland Highway the i8 can be driven with brutal abandon. The brakes are strong, the chassis is as stiff as a bank vault, and there's enough power to reach the next corner presently. BMW claims a 0-to-60 time of 4.2 seconds, and top speed is 155 m.p.h.<\/p><p>The front tires push when going hard into corners, but everything sticks coming out. Even with the stability control off, the i8 resists spinning its tires \u2014 the software ghost is still there, lurking in the machine.<\/p><p>The i8 is complicated and imperfect. A car that will be used for emissions-free commuting should allow people to get in and get out. It rides harshly. The exterior design is too clever \u2014 the layered rear deck whispers \"Your trunk is open.\"<\/p><p>Still, if the i8 represents the future of sports cars, things are looking bright.<\/p><p>A version of this review appears in print on May 11, 2014, on page AU4 of the New York edition with the headline: The Future Will See You Now.

Fewer voters than expected turned out.<\/p><p>Editor's note: John Avlon is a CNN contributor and senior political columnist for Newsweek and The Daily Beast. He is co-editor of the book \"Deadline Artists: America's Greatest Newspaper Columns.\"<\/p><p>(CNN) -- Beneath Rick Santorum's stunning three-state sweep on Tuesday stands another stubborn sign of dissatisfaction with the status quo: Republican turnout is down.<\/p><p>I'm talking embarrassingly, disturbingly, hey-don't-you-know-it's-an-election-year bad. It is a sign of a serious enthusiasm gap among the rank and file, and a particularly bad omen for Mitt Romney and the GOP in the general election.<\/p><p>Here's the tale of the tape, state by state, beginning with Tuesday night: Minnesota had just more than 47,000 people turn out for its caucuses this year -- four years ago it was nearly 63,000 -- and Romney came in first, not a distant third as he did Tuesday night. In Colorado, more than 70,000 people turned out for its caucus in 2008 -- but in 2012 it was 65,000. And Missouri -- even making a generous discount for the fact that this was an entirely symbolic contest -- had 232,000 people turn out, less than half the number who did four years ago.<\/p><p>Even with months of pre-primary hype and attention solely devoted to the Republican field, turnout in this election cycle essentially flat-lined. In Iowa, a little more than 121,000 people voted, compared with nearly 119,000 four years before, when action in the Democratic caucuses absorbed most of the attention.<\/p><p>In New Hampshire, the same dynamic applied -- 245,000 voters turned out in 2012, compared with 241,000 four years before, despite Republicans being the only game in town and independents making up 47% of the total turnout in 2012, according to CNN exit polls. Take out the independent voters and you've got a deep net decline.<\/p><p>Always proudly rebellious, South Carolina has been the great outlier in this election cycle. With Newt Gingrich making an all-out push for conservatives in a conservative state, turnout was up almost 150,000 over four years before.<\/p><p>But in Florida, the decline became unmistakable. Maybe it decreased because the Romney and Gingrich campaigns, plus super PACS, spent more than $18 million in the Sunshine State on TV ads, of which 93% were negative in the last week alone, according to the Campaign Media Analysis Group. After all, negative ads depress turnout. But after all the mud was thrown, 1.6 million people turned out in the nation's fourth largest state, which might sound impressive until you compare it with the nearly 2 million who turned out in 2008.<\/p><p>Nevada was even worse, with 32,894 people turning out to vote in a state with more than 465,000 registered Republicans. Four years before, more than 44,300 participated in the caucus. Turnout was down more than 25% despite the GOP caucuses being the only game in town. Party officials were expecting a turnout of more than 70,000.<\/p><p>All this should be a wake-up call for the GOP. Despite an enormous amount of national media attention devoted to each of the states to date, the response has been a notable yawn among the Republican rank and file.<\/p><p>The turnout numbers are even worse when you compare them with the number of registered Republicans in each state that has voted to date.<\/p><p>The caucuses in particular bring out an unrepresentative sample of a state's Republican Party. For all the grass-roots romanticism, there has got to be a better way to pick a presidential nominee.<\/p><p>But the news is worst for Romney, long the presumptive front-runner in a party that tends to reward the man next in line.<\/p><p>\"Reluctantly Romney\" could be a bumper sticker, even for his supporters. The former Massachusetts governor has found it difficult to climb above 35% in national polls, meaning that a majority of Republicans still support someone else in a notably weak field. His vote margins and totals lag behind those of four years before, when he lost the nomination to John McCain in a crowded and comparatively competent field, although Minnesota is the first state he won in '08 and lost in 2012.<\/p><p>You reap what you sow, and part of the reason turnout is down is directly related to the problem of polarization. The Republican Party is more ideologically polarized than at any time in recent history. Therefore, it put up more purely right-wing candidates than it did four years before, when center-right leaders such as McCain and Rudy Giuliani were also in the race. A bigger tent inspired bigger turnout.<\/p><p>But the other reason is simple dissatisfaction with the candidates.<\/p><p>Republicans seem united in their anger against the president -- like the Democrats in 2004 -- but they are uninspired by their options. Draft movements for fantasy candidates ranging from Chris Christie to Mitch Daniels to Paul Ryan and even Jeb Bush have started and failed. Some party leaders show more enthusiasm for a hypothetical 2016 crop of candidates, including Marco Rubio and Bobby Jindal, than they do for the flawed choices before them in this election. Divided and dispirited is an odd place for the Republican Party to be so soon after the enthusiasms of the 2010 tea party-driven election.<\/p><p>The bottom line is that voter turnout matters. And what should be most troubling for Republicans is that this enthusiasm gap among the conservative base is accompanied by a lack of candidates who might appeal to independents and centrist swing voters in the general election. It is a double barrel of bad news for the Republican Party. The numbers can be spun and rationalized by professional partisan operatives all day long, but the fact remains -- voters just aren't turning out to cast their votes for this crop of conservative candidates in 2012.<\/p><p>Follow CNN Opinion on Twitter.<\/p><p>Join the conversation on Facebook.<\/p><p>The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John Avlon.","362":"The Coworking Resources Series is supported by join.me.

Though coworking can have a lot of perks, how you take advantage of them and shape your experience is up to you.<\/p><p>\"We've had people who within the first week they've kind of immersed themselves [in]to events and socializing with other people here, or they're just here, they do their work, and then they take off,\" says Jeff Park, who manages the Ravenswood Coworking Group in Chicago. \"We know that they come in, but I think for them that's enough for them. They just want to be around other people in a productive environment.\"<\/p><p>Whether you're aiming to be as productive as possible without a lot of socializing or trying to build a strong professional community that you can turn to for resources and support, these five tips can help you get the most out of your coworking experience.<\/p><p>Green Spaces, a coworking space in Tribeca, specializes in environmentally focused businesses. Mountain View-based Cubes & Crayons combines childcare and coworking. WorkBar in Boston is hosted in a 2,500-square-foot space and has separate areas for cafe-like and quieter working styles. Coworking Brooklyn uses a small room that functions as an art gallery by night.<\/p><p>The coworking experience varies drastically depending on which space you're using. Different spaces have different levels of interaction with other workers, formality and general vibe. While some spaces, like Green Spaces and Cubes & Crayons, state their niche upfront, you'll only be able to gauge what the environment is like by dropping in. Most spaces have daily drop-in rates. Try a couple of different spaces to see what works best for you before you commit. You can find a list of space around the world on the Coworking Wiki.<\/p><p>\"See if the people in the space are people who you could go and see every day\u2026if it's not, then go to the next space,\" says Jay Catalan, the co-founder of a coworking space in Vancouver called The Network Hub.<\/p><p>It's less awkward to introduce yourself on the first day than to work alongside someone for months before asking their name. Even if you're not usually outgoing, try to make a special effort for the first week or two when you start in a new coworking space.<\/p><p>\"Just make introductions and it goes a long way\u2026We've had some people they wish they had met sooner because it turns out they did similar lines of work and just talking about it or actually sharing work, it's not something you want to find out when you only have a couple more months left on your project or something,\" Park says.<\/p><p>If you're shy about meeting people, try getting creative (like, for instance, bringing food). Bill Jacobson and Dave Ulrich, who co-founded WorkBar, said that one new coworker at WorkBar Boston showed up with a big box of doughnuts. \"He got to know everybody pretty quick,\" Jacobson says.<\/p><p>Don't stop interacting with your coworkers after you introduce yourself. One of the biggest benefits of coworking is the built-in community of professionals working across different industries.<\/p><p>\"It may not seem directly 'productive' to chat with your coworker for 10 minutes mid-day, but indirectly, it yields greater results than almost anything else you could spend time on,\" says Parker Whitney, office manager for Philadelphia coworking space Independents Hall, though he says, \"Invest in your community by taking (not faking) interest in what its members do, and it will take you with it\u2026The people you've always wanted to know are sitting all around you. Ask questions. Learn. Most importantly, help them when you can.\"<\/p><p>If you are too busy during the workday for water cooler conversation, most coworking spaces host happy hours, seminars or other events that are prime opportunities for learning more about your coworkers.<\/p><p>\"Even when you work for yourself, it's important to realize your limitations,\" says Dave Martorana, a freelance Python & iPhone developer who works at Independents Hall. \"If you're a software developer, you're not necessarily a designer, product manager, or marketer as well. When you work at a coworking space, people with those skills probably work right next to you and are just as interested in building something awesome as you are.\"<\/p><p>While coworking one day, I ended up testing someone's website, getting caught in the crossfire of a music choice showdown, and participating in a raised-hand vote about which suit jacket a fellow coworker should wear to a meeting. Needless to say, the social aspects of coworking \u2014 despite their advantages \u2014 can be extremely distracting.<\/p><p>Which is why out of the 37 productivity tips that I collected for a previous article, this one from Paul Preibisch of B3D Multitech remains my favorite:<\/p><p>\"Rather than standing up from behind your wall of monitors and shouting, 'Can you all shut up?!' you may want to consider, what I call 'The Cone of Silence.' It really works! All you need are a nice pair of headphones, (not earbuds), a wave file that plays 'white noise,' and Windows Media Player set to auto-repeat.\"<\/p><p>The Coworking Resources Series is supported by join.me.

Blacksberg, boboroshi, steveyb","363":"Writer-director Richard Linklater has described his latest film, \"Everybody Wants Some!!,\" as a \"spiritual sequel\" to 1993's \"Dazed and Confused.\" That made my heart fibrillate a little, and maybe yours too. Beginning with its shot of a Pontiac GTO pulling doughnuts in a high school parking lot to Aerosmith's \"Sweet Emotion,\" \"Dazed\" is such a humane approximation of what it was like to come of age in the mid-1970s that one wishes it would never end. On the evidence of \"Boyhood\" and the \"Before Sunrise\" trilogy, though, Linklater doesn't want any of his movies to end. Thus \"Everybody Wants Some!!\"<\/p><p>Which at first is different, sometimes jarringly so, before wading into the open-armed embrace of experience that marks this filmmaker's finest work. The tipoffs are those double exclamation points and an onscreen title font that recalls a Skinemax late-night movie circa 1981. What if you took one of that era's hormone-drenched stu-coms and put real people in it?<\/p><p>The year is 1980, actually, and Jake (Blake Jenner from \"Glee\") is arriving for his freshman year at (the fictional) Southeastern Texas State University. A high school pitching star and rangy college prospect, he's assigned an off-campus baseball dorm with the other players. It's a ready-made animal house, with rules laid down by a briefly seen coach (Jonathan Breck) that are immediately ignored. Occasionally we'll get an onscreen reminder of how many dwindling days and hours remain before classes begin. These, too, are ignored.<\/p><p>Instead, Linklater parks his cameras to observe, with indulgence and much good humor, the bonding rituals of young men who only think they have it figured out. Jake's housemates fall into general categories that re-sort themselves into individual personalities: The motor-mouthed ladies' man Finnegan (Glen Powell), the Zen surfer-stoner Willoughby (Wyatt Russell), uber-competitive McReynolds (Tyler Hoechlin), country rube Billy (Will Brittain), smartass Nesbit (Austin Amelio), na\u00efve Brumley (Tanner Kalina). And so on.<\/p><p>A few stand slightly outside the pack: the over-confident psycho-nerd pitcher Jay Niles (Juston Street, freakily funny) and the laconic second base star Dale Douglas (J. Quinton Johnson), whose blackness is rarely commented on. Where are the women? There to be chased and partied with and seduced. \"This is college, Jake,\" the hero is told early on. \"The girls can be as big sluts as the guys.\"<\/p><p>Oh, dear. Is \"Everybody Wants Some!!\" what happens when you people an entire Richard Linklater movie with Matthew McConaughey's horndog Wooderson from \"Dazed and Confused\"? Yes and no, or, rather, yes, but only at first. As the boys sprawl through the last days of summer, the swagger that borders on smug begins to mellow and melt away. Searching for good times and girls, they hop from a disco one night to a country and western bar the next to a punk mosh pit to an art-student costume party, minds open, adapting, ever-changing. After a while, the hero starts having a smallish identity crisis, confessing that \"it sort of begs the question of who we are.\"<\/p><p>Well, yes. This is college, Jake. Even a high school sports star can be anyone he wants.<\/p><p>The movie eventually spins him off from the crowd into the arms of Beverly (Zoey Deutch), a tartly ardent stage arts freshman with Joni Mitchell posters on her wall. She's unpretentious for a theater brat, he's smart and soulful for a jock, and the two stand dazzled in the Venn diagram overlap of their attraction. These scenes try a little too hard to be charming but they are anyway, and if Deutch has the freckles and immediacy of a classic Brat Pack heroine, it may be because her mother is Lea Thompson of \"Back to the Future\" and \"Some Kind of Wonderful\" and her father is Howard Deutch, who directed the latter.<\/p><p>More second-generation pleasures: Wyatt Russell, who plays the woolly baseball mystic Willoughby, is the son of Kurt Russell and Goldie Hawn, and he has a high old time \u2014 emphasis on high \u2014 explaining to his teammates why \"Fearless,\" from the 1971 album \"Meddle,\" is the best track that Pink Floyd ever recorded. Because he is correct, I am awarding \"Everybody Wants Some!!\" an extra half-star.<\/p><p>Linklater was a high school baseball player who went to Sam Houston State on a scholarship, and the movie is steeped in the lazy, rivalrous minutiae of college ball. Willoughby gets off a moment of bliss when he muses on the pleasures of pitching \u2014 \"It's lovely out there on the bump,\" he says \u2014 and we learn that it's the .230 hitters who are always the most superstitious. Also that it's possible to slice a pitched baseball in half with an ax. At one point, one of the characters gazes with incredulity at a crowd of fellow students and says, \"I know what we're doing here. We're playing baseball. What are they doing here?\"<\/p><p>\"Everybody Wants Some!!\" is a nice long soak in the Proustian detritus of its era. Beverly drives a Gremlin, Jake knows the secret of winning at \"Space Invaders,\" and people can still confidently begin sentences with the words, \"It's like Carl Sagan says. . .\" What \"Sweet Emotion\" was to \"Dazed and Confused,\" so the Knack's \"My Sharona\" is to this movie, and the soundtrack rolls forward from there: glorious junk from the days when Eddie Rabbitt, Eddie Money, Sniff 'n' the Tears, and the BusBoys meant something.<\/p><p>All that's missing is a plot. But Linklater doesn't do plot; he does life. Says Powell's garrulous Finnegan, summing up the art of both this movie and this moviemaker, \"I don't think at all. I just talk a lot. It's jazz improv. You're invited.\" And so are we.<\/p><p>Written and directed by Richard Linklater. Starring Blake Jenner, Zoey Deutch, Glen Powell, Wyatt Russell, Tyler Hoechlin, Juston Street. At Boston Common, Kendall Square. 117 minutes. R (boys being boys: language throughout, sexual content, drug use, some nudity, some baseball).","364":"Here are top moments from the House Select Committee hearing on Benghazi where former secretary of state Hillary Clinton testified. (Sarah Parnass\/The Washington Post)<\/p><p>The House Select Committee on Blumenthal, as some are now calling it, came to order at 10 a.m. Lawmakers didn't finish questioning Hillary Clinton until 11 hours later \u2014 just after the Democratic presidential candidate succumbed to a coughing fit.<\/p><p>In that period of time, the name of Sidney Blumenthal was invoked more than 75 times, and scores of questions were asked about the longtime Clinton friend. By lunchtime, Blumenthal had been invoked 49 times \u2014 exactly the number of mentions of J. Christopher Stevens, the ambassador to Libya whose death in Benghazi is the supposed subject of the congressional probe. The other three Americans slain in Benghazi \u2014 Sean Smith, Glen Doherty, Tyrone Woods \u2014 got seven or eight mentions apiece, then-CIA director David Petraeus and former defense secretary Robert Gates each got two, and then-Defense Secretary Leon Panetta had none.<\/p><p>Dana Milbank writes about political theater in the nation's capital. He joined the Post as a political reporter in 2000.<\/p><p>Chairman Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.), reading from Blumenthal's e-mails to Clinton as if he were the teacher who had intercepted a note passed between two high school kids, said Blumenthal referred to Gates as \"a mean, vicious little\"\u2014 Gowdy paused. \"I'm not going to say the word, but he did.\"<\/p><p>He also quoted Blumenthal referring to then- national security adviser Thomas E. Donilon's \"babbling rhetoric,\" and he said Blumenthal had referred to \"Obama\" (he \"left the 'president' part out\") and \"his political cronies in the White House and Chicago.\"<\/p><p>Clinton refused to get riled. \"I don't know what this line of questioning does to help us get to the bottom of deaths of four Americans,\" she said.<\/p><p>But Gowdy knew. A couple of minutes later, he announced: \"I'll tell you what: If you think you've heard about Sidney Blumenthal so far, wait until the next round.\"<\/p><p>He and his colleagues made good on that statement, posing questions on a Blumenthal visit to Clinton's home, about his work for the Clinton Foundation, his business interests, his attempt to get a job at the State Department and his communication with the former secretary of state over matters as mundane as her new iPad. They were particularly concerned with whether Blumenthal's advice to Clinton on Libya was \"unsolicited.\"<\/p><p>The Blumenthal focus shows that, after 17 months of probing Clinton, the Benghazi committee hasn't come up with much. Blumenthal has been a Clinton hatchet man for years, and he has an unsavory reputation. The very mention of his name (he was prominent during the Monica Lewinsky scandal) lends a whiff of skulduggery to any situation.<\/p><p>But injecting Blumenthal as a central character in the Benghazi probe doesn't help Republicans demonstrate that Clinton did wrong. And the justification for invoking him \u2014 to demonstrate that Clinton had more contact with him than with Stevens \u2014 is a stretch. Whatever else one thinks of the former journalist \u2014 I've clashed with him over the years \u2014 he had nothing to do with what happened in Libya on Sept. 11 and 12, 2012.<\/p><p>Rep. Mike Pompeo (R-Kan.) acted as if he had found a video of Blumenthal attacking the compound himself. Pompeo, who had previously made the false allegation that Clinton got \"most of her intelligence\" on Libya from Blumenthal, asked whether Stevens had Clinton's personal e-mail, her cellphone number, fax or home address or visited her at home. \"Mr. Blumenthal had each of those and did each of those things,\" Pompeo concluded.<\/p><p>Rep. Peter J. Roskam (R-Ill.) thought he saw a smoking gun in an e-mail correspondence from August 2011 in which Blumenthal encouraged Clinton to \"make a public statement before the cameras\" when Libyan leader Moammar Gaddafi was deposed.<\/p><p>\"Two months before the end of the Gaddafi regime and you're already planning on how to make your statement dramatic to maximize political gain,\" Roskam scolded.<\/p><p>Relevance to the Benghazi attack? None.<\/p><p>Gowdy, for his part, found it damning that Clinton aides passed along some of Blumenthal's advice (which he got from a former intelligence official) to people including Stevens. \"It's relevant because our ambassador was asked to read and respond to Sidney Blumenthal's drivel,\" the chairman said, \"in some instances on the very same day he was asking for security.\"<\/p><p>Rep. Adam B. Schiff (Calif.), a Democrat, observed that for all the time the panel has spent on Blumenthal, you'd think \"that he was in Benghazi on the night, manning the barricades.\" During private testimony from Blumenthal, to which he was summoned by federal marshals, Republicans asked more than 160 questions about Blumenthal's associations with Bill and Hillary Clinton but fewer than 20 about the Benghazi attacks.<\/p><p>Schiff and Rep. Elijah E. Cummings (Md.), the ranking Democrat, proposed that Republicans, rather than selectively releasing Blumenthal's e-mails, come clean about their interest in him and make public the entire transcript of his testimony. Gowdy, after a shouting match with Cummings, refused.<\/p><p>Read more from Dana Milbank's archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.","365":"Friday, May 5th 2000, 2:12AM<\/p><p>GLADIATOR. With Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, Connie Nielsen, Oliver Reed. Directed by Ridley Scott. At area theaters. Running time: 154 mins. Rated R: Gory violence, incest theme. 3 1\/2 Stars.<\/p><p>If there's a soft spot in your heart for the sword-&-sandal epic - and from the star rating above, I think you can guess where I stand - then you'll swoon with giddy delight over \"Gladiator,\" a sweaty, stylish hunkfest that takes you back to the days of \"Ben-Hur,\" \"Spartacus\" and the so recently departed Steve Reeves.<\/p><p>From his biceps to his gluteus, Maximus is maximus. This Roman general turned slave turned gladiator hasn't a shred of humor, but then, he doesn't have time for idle nonsense when he's lopping off heads all day. (The head-lopping is apparently his signature, like the mark of Zorro.)<\/p><p>In director Ridley Scott's thrilling, burnished epic, Maximus no sooner serves the empire by leveling Germania during a snowstorm than Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) tosses him a promotion he doesn't want - to succeed the aged emperor and whip Rome back into shape. All Maximus wants is to go home to his wife and child in the suburbs.<\/p><p>The careworn Russell Crowe is physically and temperamentally perfect for the part of Maximus. Still carrying some of the weight he packed on for \"The Insider,\" he's no gym-toned pretty boy. He's solid, beefy, rough-hewn, creaking along in his heavy leather costume, with a look on his puss of weary disdain.<\/p><p>What makes him sexy is his sense of honor and loyalty: \"What we do in life echoes in eternity!\" Anyway, it can't be his hygiene, although he is frequently bathed in a sanctifying golden glow.<\/p><p>After a coup by the emperor's weak-kneed son, Commodus (a whiny, surprisingly fleshy Joaquin Phoenix), Maximus' fortunes change. He winds up being thrown to the tigers, two shows daily, in Rome's Colosseum, the entertainment complex of its day.<\/p><p>Crowe, like his character, must grimly come to terms with the fact that, actor or gladiator, it's all about showmanship. Give the crowd what it wants, either at the multiplex or in the arena, and you can write your own ticket.<\/p><p>\"I have power only to amuse the mob,\" he spits contemptuously like a Shakespearean actor reduced to dinner theater.<\/p><p>The plot, about avenging honor, provides brief respite between an array of hand-to-hand battles that are pitched so furiously that individual components barely register; they're subliminal suggestions of computer-assisted carnage, with Jackson Pollock sprays of blood. For fans of the genre, yes, this is a good thing.<\/p><p>Connie Nielsen plays Commodus' sister and possible love interest for Maximus once his family is dispatched (politics, you know). Nielsen's costumes are laced up like bondage gear, and there is a tantalizing hint of romance past.<\/p><p>But the camera only has eyes for Crowe. The glowering! The seething! The hooded gaze! The quiet suffering! (Watch him carve away a tattoo he no longer has use for. No anesthetic! No disinfectant!)<\/p><p>The supporting cast makes for a gauntlet of worthy friends and adversaries, all of them thinkers, including Derek Jacobi (\"I, Claudius\") as a senator, Djimon Hounsou (\"Amistad\") as a fellow gladiator and Oliver Reed, who died with two days to go on the shoot, looking a little woozy as a gladiator entrepreneur.<\/p><p>Reed's character is the one most in touch with the movie's premise - that entertainment is the goal, and a worthy one at that.","366":"I think there's a real possibility that there's going to be a substantial realignment in the political scene in this country, especially if nothing is done to satisfy these dissatisfied people.<\/p><p>The Trump phenomenon is really a reflection of what happened in the referendum, to some extent, and so is Podemos and so is Syriza and so is the Front National in France.<\/p><p>Unless the western world can somehow or other satisfy large numbers of its people that it can run the economy and the country in a way which is in their interests, I think you are going to finish up with this discontent.<\/p><p>If we are going to save liberal democracy, it's very important that something is done to get it back on track again.","367":"I think there's a real possibility that there's going to be a substantial realignment in the political scene in this country, especially if nothing is done to satisfy these dissatisfied people.<\/p><p>The Trump phenomenon is really a reflection of what happened in the referendum, to some extent, and so is Podemos and so is Syriza and so is the Front National in France.<\/p><p>Unless the western world can somehow or other satisfy large numbers of its people that it can run the economy and the country in a way which is in their interests, I think you are going to finish up with this discontent.<\/p><p>If we are going to save liberal democracy, it's very important that something is done to get it back on track again.","368":"Tim Burrack, a northern Iowa farmer in his 44th growing season, has taken to keeping a wary eye out for unfamiliar vehicles around his 300 acres of genetically modified corn seeds.<\/p><p>Along with other farmers in this vast agricultural region, he has upped his vigilance ever since Mo Hailong and six other Chinese nationals were accused by U.S. authorities in 2013 of digging up seeds from Iowa farms and planning to send them back to China.<\/p><p>The case, in which Mo pleaded guilty in January, has laid bare the value\u2014and vulnerability\u2014of advanced food technology in a world with 7 billion mouths to feed, 1.36 billion of them Chinese.<\/p><p>Citing that case and others as evidence of a growing economic and national security threat to America's farm sector, U.S. law enforcement officials are urging agriculture executives and security officers to increase their vigilance and report any suspicious activity.<\/p><p>But on a March 30 visit to Iowa, Justice Department officials could offer little advice to ensure against similar thefts, underlining how agricultural technology lying in open fields can be more vulnerable than a computer network or a factory floor.<\/p><p>\"It may range down to traditional barriers like a fence and doing human patrols to making sure you get good visuals on what's occurring,\" Assistant Attorney General John Carlin, head of the Justice Department's national security division, said when touring Iowa State University.<\/p><p>But agriculture sector executives say fences and guards are not feasible, due to the high cost and impracticality of guarding hundreds of thousands of acres.<\/p><p>Tom McBride, intellectual property attorney at Monsanto\u2014one of the firms whose seeds were targeted by Mo\u2014said it safeguards its genetically modified organism (GMO) technology by protecting its computers, patenting seeds and keeping fields like Burrack's unmarked. Monsanto mon says it is not considering physical barriers like fences or guards.<\/p><p>The FBI and the U.S. Justice Department say cases of espionage in the agriculture sector have been growing since Mo was first discovered digging in an Iowan field in May 2011. Over the past two years, U.S. companies, government research facilities and universities have all been targeted, according to the FBI.<\/p><p>Although prosecutors were unable to establish a Chinese government link to Mo's group, the case adds to U.S.-China frictions over what Washington says is increasing economic espionage and trade secret theft by Beijing and its proxies.<\/p><p>A U.S. law enforcement official told Reuters the agency looked for a connection between the Chinese government and the conspiracy carried out by Mo.<\/p><p>\"In cases like this, we can see connections, but proving to the threshold needed in court requires that we have documents that the government has directed this,\" the official said. \"It's almost impossible to get.\"<\/p><p>A Chinese embassy spokesman in Washington, Zhu Haiquan, said he did not have detailed information on the Mo case but that China \"stands firm\" on the protection of intellectual property and maintains \"constant communication and cooperation\" with the U.S. government on the issue.<\/p><p>On his visit to Washington last September, President Xi Jinping reiterated China's denial of any government role in the hacking of U.S. corporate secrets.<\/p><p>Mo, an employee of Chinese firm Kings Nower Seed, pleaded guilty to stealing seed grown by U.S. firms Monsanto, Dupont Pioneer dd and LG Seeds.<\/p><p>Prosecutors say he specifically targeted fields that grow the parent seeds needed to replicate GMO corn. The FBI says it suspects he was given the location by workers for the seed companies, but did not charge any employees.<\/p><p>DuPont Pioneer and LG Seeds declined to comment for this story.<\/p><p>Mo, whose case was prosecuted by the Justice Department as a national security matter rather than a simple criminal case, now faces a sentence of up to five years in prison. Five others charged in the case are still wanted by the FBI and are believed to have fled to China or Argentina. Charges were dropped against a sixth Chinese suspect.<\/p><p>The number of international economic espionage cases referred to the FBI is rising, up 15% each year between 2009 and 2014 and up 53% in 2015. The majority of cases reported involve Chinese nationals, the U.S. law enforcement official told Reuters. In the agriculture sector, organic insecticide, irrigation equipment and rice, along with corn, are all suspected to have been targeted, including by Chinese nationals, the official said.<\/p><p>Mo Hongjian, vice president of Kings Nower Seed's parent company, Beijing Dabeinong Technology Group, declined to comment on the case or on the company's connection with the Chinese government.<\/p><p>The parent firm is privately owned, but says it receives government money for research in \"science and technology.\"<\/p><p>China bans commercial growing of GMO grains due to public opposition to the technology and imports of GMO corn have to be approved by the agriculture ministry. Still, President Xi called in 2014 for China to innovate and dominate the technique, which promises high yields through resistance to drought, pests and disease.<\/p><p>In January, a Greenpeace report found some Chinese farmers are illegally growing GMO corn whose strains belong to companies including Monsanto, Syngenta syt and DuPont Pioneer.<\/p><p>Monsanto, which supplies Burrack's seed, said it can block foreign groups who request to tour their lab and learning center in Huxley, Iowa. For the past few years, Monsanto says it has run its own background checks on Chinese delegations that ask for a tour, and, if they are approved, boosts security to be sure they do not steal anything or take pictures.<\/p><p>In Washington, U.S. senators have called for a review of the $43 billion deal by state-owned ChemChina to buy Swiss seed group Syngenta, which generates nearly a quarter of its revenue from North America.<\/p><p>Acquiring GMO seed and successfully recreating a corn plant would allow Chinese companies to skip over roughly eight years of research and $1.5 billion spent annually by Monsanto to develop the corn, the company says.<\/p><p>Burrack's farm itself was not targeted by Mo, though he grows the Monsanto parent seed that the Chinese national was digging for. Burrack grows the corn in two fields in front of and behind his house where he can watch them, a small part of his 2,800-acre farm.<\/p><p>He said he is told by Monsanto where and when to plant the parent seed, but has never been told to keep what he is planting a secret.<\/p><p>\"What no one seems to understand is that they're stealing from people like me,\" Burrack said. \"They're stealing the research that farmers pay for when they buy Monsanto seed.\"","369":"A worker sets up a polling station the morning of the GOP primary in Florida. Fewer voters than expected turned out.<\/p><p>Editor's note: John Avlon is a CNN contributor and senior political columnist for Newsweek and The Daily Beast. He is co-editor of the book \"Deadline Artists: America's Greatest Newspaper Columns.\"<\/p><p>(CNN) -- Beneath Rick Santorum's stunning three-state sweep on Tuesday stands another stubborn sign of dissatisfaction with the status quo: Republican turnout is down.<\/p><p>I'm talking embarrassingly, disturbingly, hey-don't-you-know-it's-an-election-year bad. It is a sign of a serious enthusiasm gap among the rank and file, and a particularly bad omen for Mitt Romney and the GOP in the general election.<\/p><p>Here's the tale of the tape, state by state, beginning with Tuesday night: Minnesota had just more than 47,000 people turn out for its caucuses this year -- four years ago it was nearly 63,000 -- and Romney came in first, not a distant third as he did Tuesday night. In Colorado, more than 70,000 people turned out for its caucus in 2008 -- but in 2012 it was 65,000. And Missouri -- even making a generous discount for the fact that this was an entirely symbolic contest -- had 232,000 people turn out, less than half the number who did four years ago.<\/p><p>Even with months of pre-primary hype and attention solely devoted to the Republican field, turnout in this election cycle essentially flat-lined. In Iowa, a little more than 121,000 people voted, compared with nearly 119,000 four years before, when action in the Democratic caucuses absorbed most of the attention.<\/p><p>In New Hampshire, the same dynamic applied -- 245,000 voters turned out in 2012, compared with 241,000 four years before, despite Republicans being the only game in town and independents making up 47% of the total turnout in 2012, according to CNN exit polls. Take out the independent voters and you've got a deep net decline.<\/p><p>Always proudly rebellious, South Carolina has been the great outlier in this election cycle. With Newt Gingrich making an all-out push for conservatives in a conservative state, turnout was up almost 150,000 over four years before.<\/p><p>But in Florida, the decline became unmistakable. Maybe it decreased because the Romney and Gingrich campaigns, plus super PACS, spent more than $18 million in the Sunshine State on TV ads, of which 93% were negative in the last week alone, according to the Campaign Media Analysis Group. After all, negative ads depress turnout. But after all the mud was thrown, 1.6 million people turned out in the nation's fourth largest state, which might sound impressive until you compare it with the nearly 2 million who turned out in 2008.<\/p><p>Nevada was even worse, with 32,894 people turning out to vote in a state with more than 465,000 registered Republicans. Four years before, more than 44,300 participated in the caucus. Turnout was down more than 25% despite the GOP caucuses being the only game in town. Party officials were expecting a turnout of more than 70,000.<\/p><p>All this should be a wake-up call for the GOP. Despite an enormous amount of national media attention devoted to each of the states to date, the response has been a notable yawn among the Republican rank and file.<\/p><p>The turnout numbers are even worse when you compare them with the number of registered Republicans in each state that has voted to date.<\/p><p>The caucuses in particular bring out an unrepresentative sample of a state's Republican Party. For all the grass-roots romanticism, there has got to be a better way to pick a presidential nominee.<\/p><p>But the news is worst for Romney, long the presumptive front-runner in a party that tends to reward the man next in line.<\/p><p>\"Reluctantly Romney\" could be a bumper sticker, even for his supporters. The former Massachusetts governor has found it difficult to climb above 35% in national polls, meaning that a majority of Republicans still support someone else in a notably weak field. His vote margins and totals lag behind those of four years before, when he lost the nomination to John McCain in a crowded and comparatively competent field, although Minnesota is the first state he won in '08 and lost in 2012.<\/p><p>You reap what you sow, and part of the reason turnout is down is directly related to the problem of polarization. The Republican Party is more ideologically polarized than at any time in recent history. Therefore, it put up more purely right-wing candidates than it did four years before, when center-right leaders such as McCain and Rudy Giuliani were also in the race. A bigger tent inspired bigger turnout.<\/p><p>But the other reason is simple dissatisfaction with the candidates.<\/p><p>Republicans seem united in their anger against the president -- like the Democrats in 2004 -- but they are uninspired by their options. Draft movements for fantasy candidates ranging from Chris Christie to Mitch Daniels to Paul Ryan and even Jeb Bush have started and failed. Some party leaders show more enthusiasm for a hypothetical 2016 crop of candidates, including Marco Rubio and Bobby Jindal, than they do for the flawed choices before them in this election. Divided and dispirited is an odd place for the Republican Party to be so soon after the enthusiasms of the 2010 tea party-driven election.<\/p><p>The bottom line is that voter turnout matters. And what should be most troubling for Republicans is that this enthusiasm gap among the conservative base is accompanied by a lack of candidates who might appeal to independents and centrist swing voters in the general election. It is a double barrel of bad news for the Republican Party. The numbers can be spun and rationalized by professional partisan operatives all day long, but the fact remains -- voters just aren't turning out to cast their votes for this crop of conservative candidates in 2012.<\/p><p>Follow CNN Opinion on Twitter.<\/p><p>Join the conversation on Facebook.<\/p><p>The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John Avlon.","370":"Most people, asked to identify the most universal shift in law enforcement over the past 15 years, would likely think of militarization, calls for community policing, or perhaps the slow decline of \"broken windows\".<\/p><p>But from the turn of the millennium to date, arguably no development has been more widespread in law enforcement than the adoption of so called \"less-lethal\" electric control devices (ECD), which many people know by the name of their most prolific manufacturer: Taser International. The company currently supplies their weapons to 17,800 of the United States' roughly 18,000 law enforcement agencies.<\/p><p>The brand name Taser has become as synonymous with these devices as Kleenex or Xerox have to photocopies and tissues \u2013 a quirk of language known as a \"proprietary eponym\". The word has even become a verb, as people commonly speak of being \"Tased\" or \"Tasered\".<\/p><p>The word Taser, though, didn't start with the company: it's actually a loose acronym of the book Tom Swift and His Electric Rifle. Jack Cover, the inventor of the modern ECD, named his prototype after the YA sci-fi novel he loved, and the very idea for a less-lethal electric gun was largely inspired by the fictional one described in the book.<\/p><p>And while this quirky history is known among some in law enforcement and engineering circles, the innocence with which it's told \u2013 a curious inventor culling inspiration from the literature of his youth \u2013 belies a more sinister truth: the book itself is boldly racist.<\/p><p>Tom Swift and His Electric Rifle, published in New York in 1911 under the pen name Victor Appleton, is typical of the literature of its time: an imperialist adventure tale set against the backdrop of a wild and dark African continent. In it, the protagonist, Tom Swift, develops an electric rifle \u2013 a totally novel idea in 1911 \u2013 and decides to test it in Africa in the hunt for ivory.<\/p><p>Africa, in the context of the book, exists only as a frontier of underexploited resources ripe for the wealth accumulation of white men daring enough to attempt. \"Elephant shooting in Africa! My! With my new electric rifle ... what a fellow couldn't do in the dark continent!\"<\/p><p>\"With the price of ivory soaring,\" says Swift's veteran hunting companion, \"there's a chance for us all to get a lot of money.\"<\/p><p>While this unabashed entrepreneurial imperialism tends to read as a relic of a bygone age, today disproportionately white police departments in places like Ferguson, Missouri, often function similarly as the adventurers sent to do the dangerous work of this kind of wealth generation. Like in the book, black communities are often seen not as dynamic places where people live lives, but as sites for plunder.<\/p><p>Take, for example, the Department of Justice's March report on the prevalence of predatory, revenue-based policing in St Louis County: entire municipalities there, as elsewhere in the US, float their operating budgets and justify their own existence on the racially biased extraction of statutory fees from primarily black residents. This scheme has only begun to decline because of the protests and organizing that defined Ferguson in the wake of Mike Brown's death.<\/p><p>In the book, as in America today, the black people are rendered as either passive, simple and childlike, or animalistic and capable of unimaginable violence. They are described in the book at various points as \"hideous in their savagery, wearing only the loin cloth, and with their kinky hair stuck full of sticks\", and as \"wild, savage and ferocious ... like little red apes\".<\/p><p>Swift and his travel companions quickly determine the blacks, scarcely human, need to be controlled, guided or killed as determined by the more \"civilized\" white outsiders.<\/p><p>Consider then how quickly the black people of Ferguson were rendered something less than fully human in the wake of Mike Brown's killing: an on-duty Ferguson police officer, a former NYPD commissioner and a popular actor all spared no time in invoking the discourse of \"animals\" in reference to black protesters. Near and far, incredulous commentators sought to cast the police as the sole defenders of black communities, and the only thing standing between those communities and self-destruction.<\/p><p>\"White police officers wouldn't be there if you weren't killing each other,\" former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani said on Meet the Press last November. Echoing Swift's rank paternalism, he later added: \"I probably saved more black lives as mayor of New York City than any mayor in the history of this city.\"<\/p><p>In the book, when Swift and his companions proudly use their advanced weapons \u2013 particularly the electric rifle \u2013 to dispatch with an incoming buffalo stampede, they too happily celebrate themselves as saviors.<\/p><p>\"Had it not been for the white men, the native village, which consisted of only frail huts, would have been completely wiped out by the animals,\" the novel reads.<\/p><p>Being named after a racist book doesn't make a company or device racist, any more than a person being named after a racist relative makes them so. A name is just that \u2013 and a Taser on its face is no more racist than the city or state of Washington are, simply for being named after our slaveholding first president.<\/p><p>But as recent campus activism in places such as Harvard and Princeton have demonstrated, there is real value in coming to terms with the bigotry embedded in the seemingly innocuous names and symbols of even our most ordinary, and aspirationally colorblind, institutions.<\/p><p>Being aware of the history of the word Taser should make us pause and consider that, every day, predominantly white police officers walk into predominantly black communities armed with weapons first imagined in a book in which \"civilized\" whites entered the black wilds for the purpose of plunder, only to cast themselves as the saviors of the natives. It isn't meaningless that today that sequence sometimes appears to persist in reverse.","371":"While living in an apartment in Pentagon City, Stephanie Gimenez Stahlberg and her husband, Patrick Stahlberg, a software engineer, began searching for a house where they could raise their family.<\/p><p>With two children \u2014 now 31\/2 and 1 1\/2 \u2014 the Stahlbergs needed more space, including a study area for Stephanie, who is enrolled in a PhD program at the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies.<\/p><p>The house they found in Cherrydale, a neighborhood in North Arlington, met their expectations. Within two days on the market, however, there were 10 offers. \"Our was not the highest,\" Stephanie said. \"We wrote a letter to the owners about why we liked the house.\"<\/p><p>The letter, along with a photograph of the family, worked. What drew the Stahlbergs to the house were the solar panels and the trees and bushes \u2014 raspberries, blueberries, blackberries, strawberries, grapes, apples, plums and currants \u2014 growing organically on the property. The Stahlbergs also envisioned finishing the basement bedroom and bathroom for an au pair.<\/p><p>They also fell in love with the neighborhood. They would be within walking distance to a park and two libraries with story time for children.<\/p><p>\"We were trying to look at homes where we can walk to the Metro, or bike to the city or to the Metro,\" said Stephanie, 27.<\/p><p>Sears and Montgomery Ward kit houses: Cherrydale, once abundant with cherry orchards, is a family neighborhood dating to 1893. While many neighbors have lived in the area for as long as 60 years, newcomers move in and out these days, said Kathryn Holt Springston, who worked for the Smithsonian American History Tours Office as an educational specialist and historian for 28 years. She also served as curator and director of the Arlington Historical Museum and editor of the Cherrydale Citizens' Association newsletter.<\/p><p>Single-family homes, the Arlington public schools, access to bike trails and proximity to the District draw people to the neighborhood. Sometimes, though, they move in but stay only a few years. Finding a house in Cherrydale can involve the competitive process the Stahlbergs experienced.<\/p><p>About half a mile north of the Virginia Square and Ballston Metro stations on the Orange and Silver lines, Cherrydale has a variety of residences ranging from farmhouses to bungalows to Sears and Montgomery Ward kit homes with two to five or bedrooms or sometimes more. Many date from 1900 to 1930, though some of the older houses were purchased to be torn down and replaced with larger homes, including some built as recently as this year.<\/p><p>Living there: Cherrydale lies north of Interstate 66 and south of Lorcom Lane, stretching roughly from Utah Street on the west to the northward-curving interstate on the east. The Maywood neighborhood claims the eastern half of those boundaries north of Lee Highway, lending something of an arrowhead shape to Cherrydale. Since 1908, the Cherrydale Citizens' Association has planned activities and resolved neighborhood concerns. In the 1970s and 1980s, people often referred to the neighborhood as Mayberry, according to Springston, 63. In 1948, her parents bought the house where she lives with her husband and son. It dates to 1890, Springston said.<\/p><p>In the neighborhood, 49 properties sold in the past year, according to Billy Buck, an associate broker at Buck & Associates. The lowest priced was a one-bedroom, one-bath condominium for $200,000; the highest priced was a five-bedroom, five-bath farmhouse at $1.63 million. Twelve properties are on the market now, ranging from a one-bedroom, two-bath condo for $274,900 to a new five-bedroom, five-bath Craftsman house at $1.799 million.<\/p><p>Welcome wagon: The five-points intersection \u2014 Lee Highway, Old Dominion Drive, Quincy Street, Military Road and Quebec Street \u2014 is dotted with at least two car dealerships and other commercial establishments while nearby is a Safeway and the Cherrydale Hardware, which opened in 1938.<\/p><p>The Cherrydale Volunteer Fire House, built in 1919, is home to such events as the annual spaghetti dinner, concerts and for 90 years each December there is a visit from Santa Claus for children under 12. Other community events are the annual Fourth of July party and picnic at 21st and Stafford streets. A neighborhood with its own \"welcome wagon,\" Cherrydale has approximately 1,400 households and three parks as well as the Martha Custis Trail for biking, running and walking.<\/p><p>Schools: Glebe Elementary, Taylor Elementary, Swanson Middle, Kenmore Middle and Washington-Lee High.<\/p><p>Transit: The neighborhood is close to the Virginia Square or Ballston Metro stops on the Orange and Silver lines. Metro and Arlington Transit buses connect at Ballston and Virginia Square. Capital Bikeshare also is available.<\/p><p>Crime: From July 2014 through June 2015, according to Arlington County police, one robbery and two burglaries were reported in the area.<\/p><p>Harriet Edleson is a freelance writer.","372":"Disunion follows the Civil War as it unfolded.<\/p><p>The Lincoln administration may not have gone to war in 1861 to end slavery, but no one bothered to tell that to the slaves. Within six weeks of the firing on Fort Sumter, Gen. Benjamin Butler was forced to decide what to do with three slaves who escaped to Fortress Monroe on the north shore of Virginia's James River. Butler, certainly no abolitionist, nonetheless refused to return the three to their owner, labeling them \"contrabands of war.\"<\/p><p>The term, suitably ambiguous for an administration that as yet had no policy on how to handle the fugitives, found immediate acceptance. As one Union officer wrote, \"Never was a word so speedily adopted by so many people in so short a time.\" Within weeks hundreds of \"contrabands\" \u2014 men, women and children \u2014 flocked to Fortress Monroe and other Union Army positions. Unsure what might greet them, the escaped slaves were yet confident that life under federal control must surely represent an improvement.<\/p><p>It took the federal government more than a year to devise a policy in answer to this thirst for freedom. In August 1861, the First Confiscation Act stripped slaveholders of their claim of ownership, but it failed to clarify whether the slaves were themselves free. The following March Congress prohibited the military from sending escaped slaves back into slavery, and in July the Second Confiscation Act decreed that all slaves that took refuge in Union areas were \"captives of war\" and would be set free.<\/p><p>These legislative actions took on ever greater significance as Union forces moved deeper and deeper into Confederate territory. The growing number of contrabands reaching federal lines necessitated the establishment of dozens of impromptu contraband camps. A draft map compiled by the National Park Service illustrates how the network of these generally transitory camps mirrored the advance of the Union Army along the Mississippi, Tennessee and Cumberland River systems. Grant's Army of the Tennessee spent the summer of 1862 protecting supply lines in western Tennessee and northern Mississippi. Victories at the Battle of Iuka in September and the Battle of Corinth in early October solidified Union control of the area.<\/p><p>Lincoln's announcement of the preliminary Emancipation Proclamation on Sept. 22, 1862, produced an even greater flood of refugees. How best to use and care for these contrabands proved particularly vexing for military leaders under Grant's command. \"You have no idea of the consternation Old Abe's Proclamation is making,\" wrote Gen. Grenville Dodge to his brother in September. The contrabands \"will not even wait until 1st January. I do not know what we shall do with them.\"<\/p><p>Many of these fugitives arrived in an appalling condition. \"There were men, women, and children in every stage of disease or decrepitude often nearly naked, with flesh torn by the terrible experiences of their escape,\" wrote one observer. \"Often the slaves met prejudices against their color more bitter than any they had left behind.\"<\/p><p>On Nov. 11, 1862, Grant took the first step toward addressing the crisis: he named John Eaton, a former high school principal and chaplain of the 27th Ohio Infantry, as superintendent of contrabands and set him at work \"organizing them into suitable companies for working.\" A month later he went further. \"The negroes will be clothed, and in every way provided for, out of their earnings\" \u2014 about 12.5 cents for each pound of cotton picked \u2014 \"so far as practicable,\" he ordered. \"In no case will negroes be forced into the service of the Government, or be enticed away from their homes except when it becomes a military necessity.\"<\/p><p>Grant's policies lent the contraband camps an official status and began to define what a freedman could and could not do once within the Union lines. Personally, Grant appears to have had no particular sympathy for the refugees. He seems to have recognized that, in the words of one observer, \"The soldiers of our army were a good deal opposed to serving the Negro in any manner.\" Nevertheless, the Union commander unreservedly supported Eaton's work and in the process enabled the creation of one of the war's most successful contraband camps, located at Corinth, Miss.<\/p><p>Although formally organized under the direction of General Dodge in early December 1862 and placed under the command of James M. Alexander, chaplain of the 66th Illinois, the Corinth camp likely came into existence as early as September. Initially housed in army tents no longer considered serviceable for Union troops, the freedmen were soon set to work downing trees and clearing land on which to build cabins and lay out streets, which were named for Union generals. Eventually the freedmen also built a four-room school, a commissary, a hospital, a church and an office. The entire camp was divided into wards, complete with ward masters and a police force.<\/p><p>In late 1862 the American Missionary Association sent its first volunteers to Corinth to help care for, educate and minister to the freedmen. In a memoir written years after the war, one such missionary recalled her experience. \"When brought face to face with the slaves,\" she wrote, \"it was like the discovery of a new race.\" The men and women who came to Corinth generally shared a paternalistic optimism and viewed the freedmen as childlike in their enthusiasm for both education and salvation.<\/p><p>The freedmen's thirst for knowledge was undeniable. \"You will find them every hour of daylight, at their books,\" observed the Rev. Edward Pierce in March of 1863. \"We cannot enter a cabin, or tent, but that we see from one to three with books.\" Within no time Pierce and his wife had more than 150 students, and by the end of the summer, the addition of more missionaries enabled the school to accommodate between 300 and 400 children as well as 60 adults at a night school. In August, one of the teachers estimated that as many as 1,000 freedmen had learned to read in the Corinth camp.<\/p><p>Organized religion followed closely on the heels of formal education. Reverend Olds \"saw an earnestness in reference to the Christian life that I have seldom seen. And as I saw their deep earnestness & heard their hearty responses,\" he said, \"I was led to ask where can we find a more impressible people than these?\"<\/p><p>The population of the camp fluctuated between 1,500 and 6,000, as large groups undertook assignments for the Union Army or contracted to work on local plantations. In March 1863, for example, the camp was home to 658 men, 1,440 women and 1,559 children. Among the men were 36 blacksmiths, 48 carpenters, 180 teamsters and 200 cooks. The female ranks included 80 seamstresses, 150 laundresses and 600 cooks. Two-thirds of the men and three-quarters of the women were married, and seven in eight women had children. According to John Eaton's records, the camp had experienced 900 cases of illness, 189 deaths and 45 births.<\/p><p>Life at Corinth changed dramatically after a May 1863 visit by Adj. Gen. Lorenzo Thomas, who was intent on recruiting thousands of contrabands for his newly formed black regiments. With the organization of the 1st Alabama Infantry of African Descent, later renamed the 55th United States Colored Troops, the camp lost most of its able-bodied men.<\/p><p>Their departure to fight left only the women, the young, the old and the infirm to carry on Eaton's ambitious agricultural program, which rested on the cooperative farming of large tracts of abandoned and confiscated land. The program put 400 acres under cultivation, 300 for cotton and 100 for vegetables. Each cabin also had its own subsistence garden. By May 1863, the success of the agricultural program and the presence of a multitude of skilled artisans produced a clear monthly profit of $4,000 to $5,000 for the government, as well as an admirably independent community that Eaton hoped might serve as a model for other camps.<\/p><p>Unfortunately, the success of the Corinth camp proved short-lived. Plans for a winter campaign by Union forces in January 1864 provided a grim reminder that the fate of the freedmen was always secondary to the triumph of the Union cause. The order to relocate the camp's inhabitants 93 miles westward, to Memphis, \"fell like a bomb-shell among our contented people,\" lamented one missionary, \"but military orders are preemptory,\" and they \"must be obeyed.\" The freedmen left their \"well-organized village,\" gardens and farms to tdiv><\/p><p>The move from Corinth destroyed the spirit that had animated the freedmen's success. Some of the new refugees found work on confiscated plantations or in Memphis, but most lived in one of several camps surrounding the city.<\/p><p>\"The destruction of the Corinth camp,\" noted one historian, \"was one of the tragedies of the Civil War.\" Eaton's plan for large-scale cooperative farming fell victim to a bitter struggle between the War and Treasury departments over the leasing of plantations and was never implemented elsewhere. And no more than one or two other camps were able to replicate the strong civilian leadership, well-planned and policed living environment, and emphasis on education that made Corinth a success.<\/p><p>Had the government learned from the model fashioned in northern Mississippi between the fall of 1862 and early 1864, the newly freed slaves might well have enjoyed a far easier transition to life in postwar America.<\/p><p>Sources: Joseph E.

Beginning with its shot of a Pontiac GTO pulling doughnuts in a high school parking lot to Aerosmith's \"Sweet Emotion,\" \"Dazed\" is such a humane approximation of what it was like to come of age in the mid-1970s that one wishes it would never end. On the evidence of \"Boyhood\" and the \"Before Sunrise\" trilogy, though, Linklater doesn't want any of his movies to end. Thus \"Everybody Wants Some!!\"<\/p><p>Which at first is different, sometimes jarringly so, before wading into the open-armed embrace of experience that marks this filmmaker's finest work. The tipoffs are those double exclamation points and an onscreen title font that recalls a Skinemax late-night movie circa 1981. What if you took one of that era's hormone-drenched stu-coms and put real people in it?<\/p><p>The year is 1980, actually, and Jake (Blake Jenner from \"Glee\") is arriving for his freshman year at (the fictional) Southeastern Texas State University. A high school pitching star and rangy college prospect, he's assigned an off-campus baseball dorm with the other players. It's a ready-made animal house, with rules laid down by a briefly seen coach (Jonathan Breck) that are immediately ignored. Occasionally we'll get an onscreen reminder of how many dwindling days and hours remain before classes begin. These, too, are ignored.<\/p><p>Instead, Linklater parks his cameras to observe, with indulgence and much good humor, the bonding rituals of young men who only think they have it figured out. Jake's housemates fall into general categories that re-sort themselves into individual personalities: The motor-mouthed ladies' man Finnegan (Glen Powell), the Zen surfer-stoner Willoughby (Wyatt Russell), uber-competitive McReynolds (Tyler Hoechlin), country rube Billy (Will Brittain), smartass Nesbit (Austin Amelio), na\u00efve Brumley (Tanner Kalina). And so on.<\/p><p>A few stand slightly outside the pack: the over-confident psycho-nerd pitcher Jay Niles (Juston Street, freakily funny) and the laconic second base star Dale Douglas (J. Quinton Johnson), whose blackness is rarely commented on. Where are the women? There to be chased and partied with and seduced. \"This is college, Jake,\" the hero is told early on. \"The girls can be as big sluts as the guys.\"<\/p><p>Oh, dear. Is \"Everybody Wants Some!!\" what happens when you people an entire Richard Linklater movie with Matthew McConaughey's horndog Wooderson from \"Dazed and Confused\"? Yes and no, or, rather, yes, but only at first. As the boys sprawl through the last days of summer, the swagger that borders on smug begins to mellow and melt away. Searching for good times and girls, they hop from a disco one night to a country and western bar the next to a punk mosh pit to an art-student costume party, minds open, adapting, ever-changing. After a while, the hero starts having a smallish identity crisis, confessing that \"it sort of begs the question of who we are.\"<\/p><p>Well, yes. This is college, Jake. Even a high school sports star can be anyone he wants.<\/p><p>The movie eventually spins him off from the crowd into the arms of Beverly (Zoey Deutch), a tartly ardent stage arts freshman with Joni Mitchell posters on her wall. She's unpretentious for a theater brat, he's smart and soulful for a jock, and the two stand dazzled in the Venn diagram overlap of their attraction. These scenes try a little too hard to be charming but they are anyway, and if Deutch has the freckles and immediacy of a classic Brat Pack heroine, it may be because her mother is Lea Thompson of \"Back to the Future\" and \"Some Kind of Wonderful\" and her father is Howard Deutch, who directed the latter.<\/p><p>More second-generation pleasures: Wyatt Russell, who plays the woolly baseball mystic Willoughby, is the son of Kurt Russell and Goldie Hawn, and he has a high old time \u2014 emphasis on high \u2014 explaining to his teammates why \"Fearless,\" from the 1971 album \"Meddle,\" is the best track that Pink Floyd ever recorded. Because he is correct, I am awarding \"Everybody Wants Some!!\" an extra half-star.<\/p><p>Linklater was a high school baseball player who went to Sam Houston State on a scholarship, and the movie is steeped in the lazy, rivalrous minutiae of college ball. Willoughby gets off a moment of bliss when he muses on the pleasures of pitching \u2014 \"It's lovely out there on the bump,\" he says \u2014 and we learn that it's the .230 hitters who are always the most superstitious. Also that it's possible to slice a pitched baseball in half with an ax. At one point, one of the characters gazes with incredulity at a crowd of fellow students and says, \"I know what we're doing here. We're playing baseball. What are they doing here?\"<\/p><p>\"Everybody Wants Some!!\" is a nice long soak in the Proustian detritus of its era.

Ms. Temple said the longer Mr. Akin waited, the more difficult it would get.<\/p><p>The first deadline for Mr. Akin to have easily withdrawn from the race was Tuesday evening. His decision to stay in the race means that he now has only a few weeks to reconsider before things get even harder.<\/p><p>Certification of the presidential ballots in Missouri will be no later than Sept. 17, and could be shortly after President Obama officially accepts the Democratic nomination on Sept. 5.<\/p><p>Once the ballots are printed, any candidate who seeks to withdraw must pay for the reprinting of new ballots. That could be prohibitively expensive for Mr. Akin, but presumably the Republican Party \u2014 which badly wants him to withdraw \u2014 would cover the cost.<\/p><p>Military overseas ballots begin shipping out Sept. 22. That might be the first firm deadline. But the drop-dead deadline is Sept. 25, when general absentee ballots are sent out.<\/p><p>Mel Carnahan, the former Missouri governor and Ms. Carnahan's father, died on Oct. 16, 2000, during his campaign for the Senate against the Republican incumbent, John Ashcroft. Mr. Carnahan's name nonetheless appeared on the ballot in November \u2014 and he won. (His widow, Jean, was appointed to the seat, and lost it in special election in 2002.)<\/p><p>Assuming that Mr. Akin bows to pressure from Republican leaders (or simply concludes that he isn't able to raise enough money to mount a credible campaign), Missouri law requires that he seek a court order allowing him to drop out of the race.<\/p><p>State officials say that issuing such court orders is routine. Mr. Akin would merely have to file the necessary papers with the court and his name would no longer be printed on the November ballot. Republicans could then quickly nominate someone else to run against Senator Claire McCaskill, the Democratic incumbent.<\/p><p>Democrats would no doubt like to see Mr. Akin \u2014 now politically weakened by his comments on rape and pregnancy \u2014 stay in the race. In theory, the Democratic officials who run the state's election offices could object to Mr. Akin's request for a court order, a move that would force a hearing before a judge.<\/p><p>The relevant statute says someone like Mr. Akin can withdraw \"pursuant to a court order, which, except for good cause shown by the election authority in opposition thereto, shall be freely given upon application by the candidate to the circuit court in the county of such candidate's residence.\"<\/p><p>Election officials say they can find no precedent at all for such an objection in the state's history. But Ms. Carnahan is herself a factor in Republican minds. As the Democratic Senate nominee in 2010, she lost to Representative Roy Blunt, and Republicans imagine she could put up a fight.<\/p><p>\"The secretary's job is to protect the rights of Missouri voters,\" Ms. Temple said when asked whether Ms. Carnahan would fight a court order to remove Mr. Akin's name from the ballot.<\/p><p>A further complication: Under state law, any election authority in Missouri can oppose a withdrawal order, down to the county and city level, and there are Democrats aplenty in Missouri. But Ms. Temple added that right now, it would be up to a Missouri court to determine whether Mr. Akin could withdraw, not the secretary of state.<\/p><p>\"It's completely in the hands of the court to decide the facts,\" she said.<\/p><p>Assuming Mr. Akin does manage to drop out, the state central committee of the Republican Party in Missouri would have to pick a new candidate within 28 days, or by Oct. 12, whichever comes first.","376":"A worker sets up a polling station the morning of the GOP primary in Florida. Fewer voters than expected turned out.<\/p><p>Editor's note: John Avlon is a CNN contributor and senior political columnist for Newsweek and The Daily Beast. He is co-editor of the book \"Deadline Artists: America's Greatest Newspaper Columns.\"<\/p><p>(CNN) -- Beneath Rick Santorum's stunning three-state sweep on Tuesday stands another stubborn sign of dissatisfaction with the status quo: Republican turnout is down.<\/p><p>I'm talking embarrassingly, disturbingly, hey-don't-you-know-it's-an-election-year bad. It is a sign of a serious enthusiasm gap among the rank and file, and a particularly bad omen for Mitt Romney and the GOP in the general election.<\/p><p>Here's the tale of the tape, state by state, beginning with Tuesday night: Minnesota had just more than 47,000 people turn out for its caucuses this year -- four years ago it was nearly 63,000 -- and Romney came in first, not a distant third as he did Tuesday night. In Colorado, more than 70,000 people turned out for its caucus in 2008 -- but in 2012 it was 65,000. And Missouri -- even making a generous discount for the fact that this was an entirely symbolic contest -- had 232,000 people turn out, less than half the number who did four years ago.<\/p><p>Even with months of pre-primary hype and attention solely devoted to the Republican field, turnout in this election cycle essentially flat-lined. In Iowa, a little more than 121,000 people voted, compared with nearly 119,000 four years before, when action in the Democratic caucuses absorbed most of the attention.<\/p><p>In New Hampshire, the same dynamic applied -- 245,000 voters turned out in 2012, compared with 241,000 four years before, despite Republicans being the only game in town and independents making up 47% of the total turnout in 2012, according to CNN exit polls. Take out the independent voters and you've got a deep net decline.<\/p><p>Always proudly rebellious, South Carolina has been the great outlier in this election cycle. With Newt Gingrich making an all-out push for conservatives in a conservative state, turnout was up almost 150,000 over four years before.<\/p><p>But in Florida, the decline became unmistakable. Maybe it decreased because the Romney and Gingrich campaigns, plus super PACS, spent more than $18 million in the Sunshine State on TV ads, of which 93% were negative in the last week alone, according to the Campaign Media Analysis Group. After all, negative ads depress turnout. But after all the mud was thrown, 1.6 million people turned out in the nation's fourth largest state, which might sound impressive until you compare it with the nearly 2 million who turned out in 2008.<\/p><p>Nevada was even worse, with 32,894 people turning out to vote in a state with more than 465,000 registered Republicans. Four years before, more than 44,300 participated in the caucus. Turnout was down more than 25% despite the GOP caucuses being the only game in town. Party officials were expecting a turnout of more than 70,000.<\/p><p>All this should be a wake-up call for the GOP. Despite an enormous amount of national media attention devoted to each of the states to date, the response has been a notable yawn among the Republican rank and file.<\/p><p>The turnout numbers are even worse when you compare them with the number of registered Republicans in each state that has voted to date.<\/p><p>The caucuses in particular bring out an unrepresentative sample of a state's Republican Party. For all the grass-roots romanticism, there has got to be a better way to pick a presidential nominee.<\/p><p>But the news is worst for Romney, long the presumptive front-runner in a party that tends to reward the man next in line.<\/p><p>\"Reluctantly Romney\" could be a bumper sticker, even for his supporters. The former Massachusetts governor has found it difficult to climb above 35% in national polls, meaning that a majority of Republicans still support someone else in a notably weak field. His vote margins and totals lag behind those of four years before, when he lost the nomination to John McCain in a crowded and comparatively competent field, although Minnesota is the first state he won in '08 and lost in 2012.<\/p><p>You reap what you sow, and part of the reason turnout is down is directly related to the problem of polarization. The Republican Party is more ideologically polarized than at any time in recent history. Therefore, it put up more purely right-wing candidates than it did four years before, when center-right leaders such as McCain and Rudy Giuliani were also in the race. A bigger tent inspired bigger turnout.<\/p><p>But the other reason is simple dissatisfaction with the candidates.<\/p><p>Republicans seem united in their anger against the president -- like the Democrats in 2004 -- but they are uninspired by their options. Draft movements for fantasy candidates ranging from Chris Christie to Mitch Daniels to Paul Ryan and even Jeb Bush have started and failed. Some party leaders show more enthusiasm for a hypothetical 2016 crop of candidates, including Marco Rubio and Bobby Jindal, than they do for the flawed choices before them in this election. Divided and dispirited is an odd place for the Republican Party to be so soon after the enthusiasms of the 2010 tea party-driven election.<\/p><p>The bottom line is that voter turnout matters. And what should be most troubling for Republicans is that this enthusiasm gap among the conservative base is accompanied by a lack of candidates who might appeal to independents and centrist swing voters in the general election. It is a double barrel of bad news for the Republican Party. The numbers can be spun and rationalized by professional partisan operatives all day long, but the fact remains -- voters just aren't turning out to cast their votes for this crop of conservative candidates in 2012.<\/p><p>Follow CNN Opinion on Twitter.<\/p><p>Join the conversation on Facebook.<\/p><p>The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John Avlon.","377":"Tim Burrack, a northern Iowa farmer in his 44th growing season, has taken to keeping a wary eye out for unfamiliar vehicles around his 300 acres of genetically modified corn seeds.<\/p><p>Along with other farmers in this vast agricultural region, he has upped his vigilance ever since Mo Hailong and six other Chinese nationals were accused by U.S. authorities in 2013 of digging up seeds from Iowa farms and planning to send them back to China.<\/p><p>The case, in which Mo pleaded guilty in January, has laid bare the value\u2014and vulnerability\u2014of advanced food technology in a world with 7 billion mouths to feed, 1.36 billion of them Chinese.<\/p><p>Citing that case and others as evidence of a growing economic and national security threat to America's farm sector, U.S. law enforcement officials are urging agriculture executives and security officers to increase their vigilance and report any suspicious activity.<\/p><p>But on a March 30 visit to Iowa, Justice Department officials could offer little advice to ensure against similar thefts, underlining how agricultural technology lying in open fields can be more vulnerable than a computer network or a factory floor.<\/p><p>\"It may range down to traditional barriers like a fence and doing human patrols to making sure you get good visuals on what's occurring,\" Assistant Attorney General John Carlin, head of the Justice Department's national security division, said when touring Iowa State University.<\/p><p>But agriculture sector executives say fences and guards are not feasible, due to the high cost and impracticality of guarding hundreds of thousands of acres.<\/p><p>Tom McBride, intellectual property attorney at Monsanto\u2014one of the firms whose seeds were targeted by Mo\u2014said it safeguards its genetically modified organism (GMO) technology by protecting its computers, patenting seeds and keeping fields like Burrack's unmarked. Monsanto mon says it is not considering physical barriers like fences or guards.<\/p><p>The FBI and the U.S. Justice Department say cases of espionage in the agriculture sector have been growing since Mo was first discovered digging in an Iowan field in May 2011. Over the past two years, U.S. companies, government research facilities and universities have all been targeted, according to the FBI.<\/p><p>Although prosecutors were unable to establish a Chinese government link to Mo's group, the case adds to U.S.-China frictions over what Washington says is increasing economic espionage and trade secret theft by Beijing and its proxies.<\/p><p>A U.S. law enforcement official told Reuters the agency looked for a connection between the Chinese government and the conspiracy carried out by Mo.<\/p><p>\"In cases like this, we can see connections, but proving to the threshold needed in court requires that we have documents that the government has directed this,\" the official said. \"It's almost impossible to get.\"<\/p><p>A Chinese embassy spokesman in Washington, Zhu Haiquan, said he did not have detailed information on the Mo case but that China \"stands firm\" on the protection of intellectual property and maintains \"constant communication and cooperation\" with the U.S. government on the issue.<\/p><p>On his visit to Washington last September, President Xi Jinping reiterated China's denial of any government role in the hacking of U.S. corporate secrets.<\/p><p>Mo, an employee of Chinese firm Kings Nower Seed, pleaded guilty to stealing seed grown by U.S. firms Monsanto, Dupont Pioneer dd and LG Seeds.<\/p><p>Prosecutors say he specifically targeted fields that grow the parent seeds needed to replicate GMO corn. The FBI says it suspects he was given the location by workers for the seed companies, but did not charge any employees.<\/p><p>DuPont Pioneer and LG Seeds declined to comment for this story.<\/p><p>Mo, whose case was prosecuted by the Justice Department as a national security matter rather than a simple criminal case, now faces a sentence of up to five years in prison. Five others charged in the case are still wanted by the FBI and are believed to have fled to China or Argentina. Charges were dropped against a sixth Chinese suspect.<\/p><p>The number of international economic espionage cases referred to the FBI is rising, up 15% each year between 2009 and 2014 and up 53% in 2015. The majority of cases reported involve Chinese nationals, the U.S. law enforcement official told Reuters. In the agriculture sector, organic insecticide, irrigation equipment and rice, along with corn, are all suspected to have been targeted, including by Chinese nationals, the official said.<\/p><p>Mo Hongjian, vice president of Kings Nower Seed's parent company, Beijing Dabeinong Technology Group, declined to comment on the case or on the company's connection with the Chinese government.<\/p><p>The parent firm is privately owned, but says it receives government money for research in \"science and technology.\"<\/p><p>China bans commercial growing of GMO grains due to public opposition to the technology and imports of GMO corn have to be approved by the agriculture ministry. Still, President Xi called in 2014 for China to innovate and dominate the technique, which promises high yields through resistance to drought, pests and disease.<\/p><p>In January, a Greenpeace report found some Chinese farmers are illegally growing GMO corn whose strains belong to companies including Monsanto, Syngenta syt and DuPont Pioneer.<\/p><p>Monsanto, which supplies Burrack's seed, said it can block foreign groups who request to tour their lab and learning center in Huxley, Iowa. For the past few years, Monsanto says it has run its own background checks on Chinese delegations that ask for a tour, and, if they are approved, boosts security to be sure they do not steal anything or take pictures.<\/p><p>In Washington, U.S. senators have called for a review of the $43 billion deal by state-owned ChemChina to buy Swiss seed group Syngenta, which generates nearly a quarter of its revenue from North America.<\/p><p>Acquiring GMO seed and successfully recreating a corn plant would allow Chinese companies to skip over roughly eight years of research and $1.5 billion spent annually by Monsanto to develop the corn, the company says.<\/p><p>Burrack's farm itself was not targeted by Mo, though he grows the Monsanto parent seed that the Chinese national was digging for. Burrack grows the corn in two fields in front of and behind his house where he can watch them, a small part of his 2,800-acre farm.<\/p><p>He said he is told by Monsanto where and when to plant the parent seed, but has never been told to keep what he is planting a secret.<\/p><p>\"What no one seems to understand is that they're stealing from people like me,\" Burrack said. \"They're stealing the research that farmers pay for when they buy Monsanto seed.\"","378":"Friday, May 5th 2000, 2:12AM<\/p><p>GLADIATOR. With Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, Connie Nielsen, Oliver Reed. Directed by Ridley Scott. At area theaters. Running time: 154 mins. Rated R: Gory violence, incest theme. 3 1\/2 Stars.<\/p><p>If there's a soft spot in your heart for the sword-&-sandal epic - and from the star rating above, I think you can guess where I stand - then you'll swoon with giddy delight over \"Gladiator,\" a sweaty, stylish hunkfest that takes you back to the days of \"Ben-Hur,\" \"Spartacus\" and the so recently departed Steve Reeves.<\/p><p>From his biceps to his gluteus, Maximus is maximus. This Roman general turned slave turned gladiator hasn't a shred of humor, but then, he doesn't have time for idle nonsense when he's lopping off heads all day. (The head-lopping is apparently his signature, like the mark of Zorro.)<\/p><p>In director Ridley Scott's thrilling, burnished epic, Maximus no sooner serves the empire by leveling Germania during a snowstorm than Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) tosses him a promotion he doesn't want - to succeed the aged emperor and whip Rome back into shape. All Maximus wants is to go home to his wife and child in the suburbs.<\/p><p>The careworn Russell Crowe is physically and temperamentally perfect for the part of Maximus. Still carrying some of the weight he packed on for \"The Insider,\" he's no gym-toned pretty boy. He's solid, beefy, rough-hewn, creaking along in his heavy leather costume, with a look on his puss of weary disdain.<\/p><p>What makes him sexy is his sense of honor and loyalty: \"What we do in life echoes in eternity!\" Anyway, it can't be his hygiene, although he is frequently bathed in a sanctifying golden glow.<\/p><p>After a coup by the emperor's weak-kneed son, Commodus (a whiny, surprisingly fleshy Joaquin Phoenix), Maximus' fortunes change. He winds up being thrown to the tigers, two shows daily, in Rome's Colosseum, the entertainment complex of its day.<\/p><p>Crowe, like his character, must grimly come to terms with the fact that, actor or gladiator, it's all about showmanship. Give the crowd what it wants, either at the multiplex or in the arena, and you can write your own ticket.<\/p><p>\"I have power only to amuse the mob,\" he spits contemptuously like a Shakespearean actor reduced to dinner theater.<\/p><p>The plot, about avenging honor, provides brief respite between an array of hand-to-hand battles that are pitched so furiously that individual components barely register; they're subliminal suggestions of computer-assisted carnage, with Jackson Pollock sprays of blood. For fans of the genre, yes, this is a good thing.<\/p><p>Connie Nielsen plays Commodus' sister and possible love interest for Maximus once his family is dispatched (politics, you know). Nielsen's costumes are laced up like bondage gear, and there is a tantalizing hint of romance past.<\/p><p>But the camera only has eyes for Crowe. The glowering! The seething! The hooded gaze! The quiet suffering! (Watch him carve away a tattoo he no longer has use for. No anesthetic! No disinfectant!)<\/p><p>The supporting cast makes for a gauntlet of worthy friends and adversaries, all of them thinkers, including Derek Jacobi (\"I, Claudius\") as a senator, Djimon Hounsou (\"Amistad\") as a fellow gladiator and Oliver Reed, who died with two days to go on the shoot, looking a little woozy as a gladiator entrepreneur.<\/p><p>Reed's character is the one most in touch with the movie's premise - that entertainment is the goal, and a worthy one at that.","379":"By DEXTER FORDMAY 9, 2014<\/p><p>MALIBU, CALIF. \u2014 Good luck, America, with your efforts to pigeonhole the BMW i8.<\/p><p>The car is a post-petroleum brand statement. It's a sci-fi showpiece. It's an ultralight carbon-fiber production car. It's a triumph of parts-bin engineering. It's a take-no-prisoners canyon racer. It's a winged chariot of the Malibu \u00fcber-chic. It's a $136,625 (destination included!) commuter car for Silicon Valley moguls.<\/p><p>The hardware, at least, is straightforward. The central passenger shell is a stiff, lightweight carbon-fiber structure. It is bolted to an aluminum skeleton that holds the 7.1-kilowatt-hour lithium-ion battery pack in its spine.<\/p><p>An electric drive section similar to the one in the BMW i3 people pod is bolted to the front, its 131 horsepower electric motor and 2-speed automatic transmission driving the front wheels. The rear power package is sourced from the new Mini; its 3-cylinder, twin-turbocharged 231-horsepower engine drives the rear wheels through a 6-speed automatic transmission.<\/p><p>The multilayered skin is molded thermoplastic that weighs half as much as steel. Other extreme weight-saving measures, including aluminum wiring and chemically hardened ultrathin glass, keep the weight to 3,267 pounds. The long, light doors swing up and forward. From the front, with doors open, the i8 looks as if it's signaling a touchdown.<\/p><p>The interior is compact yet comfortable, though those over 6-foot-2 may need more legroom, and the rear seats are designed for tiny, limber people.<\/p><p>Getting in is a challenge. The sill is wide, the seat is low, and there's a trick: sit sideways, slide butt in, retract legs. Getting out? Imagine climbing from a bathtub without using your hands.<\/p><p>Pick a personality with the driving-mode buttons. \"Comfort\" keeps the car in electric mode to 37 m.p.h., or until you mash the right-side pedal. The eDrive button keeps things electric to 75 m.p.h. or until the battery fades.<\/p><p>Travel range is about 20 miles in E.V. mode, and recharging takes 1.5 hours at 240 volts or four hours at 120. The Eco-Pro button increases electric efficiency 20 percent by softening the motor response and optimizing climate-control settings. I observed gasoline-powered mileage figures from 27 m.p.g. (impatient cornering) to 37 m.p.g. (safe-and-sane commuting).<\/p><p>In the city, the i8 feels silent, solid and intuitive \u2014 the excitement happens outside, as gawkers track its progress.<\/p><p>On Los Angeles's well-used freeways, the Comfort setting leaves some comfort to be desired. Even with the variable dampers at full soft, the i8 bobs its nose like Muhammad Ali in the first rounds. High-performance tires come standard in the United States; European versions get narrower wheels and taller tires for lower drag and a smoother ride.<\/p><p>In Sport mode, the suspension and steering stiffen and the gas engine roars, pops on upshifts and matches revs downshifting into corners. It sounds great, and it should: much of what you hear is a prerecorded soundtrack piped through the sound system.<\/p><p>The i8 feels strong at full power, but the head-snapping response expected from a partly electric powertrain is absent. The i8 takes time to gather itself, with an atavistic vestige of turbo lag.<\/p><p>On the intestinal twists of Mulholland Highway the i8 can be driven with brutal abandon. The brakes are strong, the chassis is as stiff as a bank vault, and there's enough power to reach the next corner presently. BMW claims a 0-to-60 time of 4.2 seconds, and top speed is 155 m.p.h.<\/p><p>The front tires push when going hard into corners, but everything sticks coming out. Even with the stability control off, the i8 resists spinning its tires \u2014 the software ghost is still there, lurking in the machine.<\/p><p>The i8 is complicated and imperfect. A car that will be used for emissions-free commuting should allow people to get in and get out. It rides harshly. The exterior design is too clever \u2014 the layered rear deck whispers \"Your trunk is open.\"<\/p><p>Still, if the i8 represents the future of sports cars, things are looking bright.<\/p><p>A version of this review appears in print on May 11, 2014, on page AU4 of the New York edition with the headline: The Future Will See You Now.

I wanted to move on and forget because I didn't understand,\" Stelling shares.<\/p><p>\"I don't want revenge or to hurt him now, but it's unhealthy to keep this inside because my stand-up is pulled directly from my life.

For fans of the genre, yes, this is a good thing.<\/p><p>Connie Nielsen plays Commodus' sister and possible love interest for Maximus once his family is dispatched (politics, you know). Nielsen's costumes are laced up like bondage gear, and there is a tantalizing hint of romance past.<\/p><p>But the camera only has eyes for Crowe. The glowering! The seething! The hooded gaze!

The company currently supplies their weapons to 17,800 of the United States' roughly 18,000 law enforcement agencies.<\/p><p>The brand name Taser has become as synonymous with these devices as Kleenex or Xerox have to photocopies and tissues \u2013 a quirk of language known as a \"proprietary eponym\". The word has even become a verb, as people commonly speak of being \"Tased\" or \"Tasered\".<\/p><p>The word Taser, though, didn't start with the company: it's actually a loose acronym of the book Tom Swift and His Electric Rifle. Jack Cover, the inventor of the modern ECD, named his prototype after the YA sci-fi novel he loved, and the very idea for a less-lethal electric gun was largely inspired by the fictional one described in the book.<\/p><p>And while this quirky history is known among some in law enforcement and engineering circles, the innocence with which it's told \u2013 a curious inventor culling inspiration from the literature of his youth \u2013 belies a more sinister truth: the book itself is boldly racist.<\/p><p>Tom Swift and His Electric Rifle, published in New York in 1911 under the pen name Victor Appleton, is typical of the literature of its time: an imperialist adventure tale set against the backdrop of a wild and dark African continent. In it, the protagonist, Tom Swift, develops an electric rifle \u2013 a totally novel idea in 1911 \u2013 and decides to test it in Africa in the hunt for ivory.<\/p><p>Africa, in the context of the book, exists only as a frontier of underexploited resources ripe for the wealth accumulation of white men daring enough to attempt. \"Elephant shooting in Africa! My! With my new electric rifle ... what a fellow couldn't do in the dark continent!\"<\/p><p>\"With the price of ivory soaring,\" says Swift's veteran hunting companion, \"there's a chance for us all to get a lot of money.\"<\/p><p>While this unabashed entrepreneurial imperialism tends to read as a relic of a bygone age, today disproportionately white police departments in places like Ferguson, Missouri, often function similarly as the adventurers sent to do the dangerous work of this kind of wealth generation. Like in the book, black communities are often seen not as dynamic places where people live lives, but as sites for plunder.<\/p><p>Take, for example, the Department of Justice's March report on the prevalence of predatory, revenue-based policing in St Louis County: entire municipalities there, as elsewhere in the US, float their operating budgets and justify their own existence on the racially biased extraction of statutory fees from primarily black residents. This scheme has only begun to decline because of the protests and organizing that defined Ferguson in the wake of Mike Brown's death.<\/p><p>In the book, as in America today, the black people are rendered as either passive, simple and childlike, or animalistic and capable of unimaginable violence. They are described in the book at various points as \"hideous in their savagery, wearing only the loin cloth, and with their kinky hair stuck full of sticks\", and as \"wild, savage and ferocious ... like little red apes\".<\/p><p>Swift and his travel companions quickly determine the blacks, scarcely human, need to be controlled, guided or killed as determined by the more \"civilized\" white outsiders.<\/p><p>Consider then how quickly the black people of Ferguson were rendered something less than fully human in the wake of Mike Brown's killing: an on-duty Ferguson police officer, a former NYPD commissioner and a popular actor all spared no time in invoking the discourse of \"animals\" in reference to black protesters. Near and far, incredulous commentators sought to cast the police as the sole defenders of black communities, and the only thing standing between those communities and self-destruction.<\/p><p>\"White police officers wouldn't be there if you weren't killing each other,\" former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani said on Meet the Press last November. Echoing Swift's rank paternalism, he later added: \"I probably saved more black lives as mayor of New York City than any mayor in the history of this city.\"<\/p><p>In the book, when Swift and his companions proudly use their advanced weapons \u2013 particularly the electric rifle \u2013 to dispatch with an incoming buffalo stampede, they too happily celebrate themselves as saviors.<\/p><p>\"Had it not been for the white men, the native village, which consisted of only frail huts, would have been completely wiped out by the animals,\" the novel reads.<\/p><p>Being named after a racist book doesn't make a company or device racist, any more than a person being named after a racist relative makes them so. A name is just that \u2013 and a Taser on its face is no more racist than the city or state of Washington are, simply for being named after our slaveholding first president.<\/p><p>But as recent campus activism in places such as Harvard and Princeton have demonstrated, there is real value in coming to terms with the bigotry embedded in the seemingly innocuous names and symbols of even our most ordinary, and aspirationally colorblind, institutions.<\/p><p>Being aware of the history of the word Taser should make us pause and consider that, every day, predominantly white police officers walk into predominantly black communities armed with weapons first imagined in a book in which \"civilized\" whites entered the black wilds for the purpose of plunder, only to cast themselves as the saviors of the natives. It isn't meaningless that today that sequence sometimes appears to persist in reverse.","386":"Disunion follows the Civil War as it unfolded.<\/p><p>The Lincoln administration may not have gone to war in 1861 to end slavery, but no one bothered to tell that to the slaves. Within six weeks of the firing on Fort Sumter, Gen. Benjamin Butler was forced to decide what to do with three slaves who escaped to Fortress Monroe on the north shore of Virginia's James River. Butler, certainly no abolitionist, nonetheless refused to return the three to their owner, labeling them \"contrabands of war.\"<\/p><p>The term, suitably ambiguous for an administration that as yet had no policy on how to handle the fugitives, found immediate acceptance. As one Union officer wrote, \"Never was a word so speedily adopted by so many people in so short a time.\" Within weeks hundreds of \"contrabands\" \u2014 men, women and children \u2014 flocked to Fortress Monroe and other Union Army positions. Unsure what might greet them, the escaped slaves were yet confident that life under federal control must surely represent an improvement.<\/p><p>It took the federal government more than a year to devise a policy in answer to this thirst for freedom. In August 1861, the First Confiscation Act stripped slaveholders of their claim of ownership, but it failed to clarify whether the slaves were themselves free. The following March Congress prohibited the military from sending escaped slaves back into slavery, and in July the Second Confiscation Act decreed that all slaves that took refuge in Union areas were \"captives of war\" and would be set free.<\/p><p>These legislative actions took on ever greater significance as Union forces moved deeper and deeper into Confederate territory. The growing number of contrabands reaching federal lines necessitated the establishment of dozens of impromptu contraband camps. A draft map compiled by the National Park Service illustrates how the network of these generally transitory camps mirrored the advance of the Union Army along the Mississippi, Tennessee and Cumberland River systems. Grant's Army of the Tennessee spent the summer of 1862 protecting supply lines in western Tennessee and northern Mississippi. Victories at the Battle of Iuka in September and the Battle of Corinth in early October solidified Union control of the area.<\/p><p>Lincoln's announcement of the preliminary Emancipation Proclamation on Sept. 22, 1862, produced an even greater flood of refugees. How best to use and care for these contrabands proved particularly vexing for military leaders under Grant's command. \"You have no idea of the consternation Old Abe's Proclamation is making,\" wrote Gen. Grenville Dodge to his brother in September. The contrabands \"will not even wait until 1st January. I do not know what we shall do with them.\"<\/p><p>Many of these fugitives arrived in an appalling condition. \"There were men, women, and children in every stage of disease or decrepitude often nearly naked, with flesh torn by the terrible experiences of their escape,\" wrote one observer. \"Often the slaves met prejudices against their color more bitter than any they had left behind.\"<\/p><p>On Nov. 11, 1862, Grant took the first step toward addressing the crisis: he named John Eaton, a former high school principal and chaplain of the 27th Ohio Infantry, as superintendent of contrabands and set him at work \"organizing them into suitable companies for working.\" A month later he went further. \"The negroes will be clothed, and in every way provided for, out of their earnings\" \u2014 about 12.5 cents for each pound of cotton picked \u2014 \"so far as practicable,\" he ordered. \"In no case will negroes be forced into the service of the Government, or be enticed away from their homes except when it becomes a military necessity.\"<\/p><p>Grant's policies lent the contraband camps an official status and began to define what a freedman could and could not do once within the Union lines. Personally, Grant appears to have had no particular sympathy for the refugees. He seems to have recognized that, in the words of one observer, \"The soldiers of our army were a good deal opposed to serving the Negro in any manner.\" Nevertheless, the Union commander unreservedly supported Eaton's work and in the process enabled the creation of one of the war's most successful contraband camps, located at Corinth, Miss.<\/p><p>Although formally organized under the direction of General Dodge in early December 1862 and placed under the command of James M. Alexander, chaplain of the 66th Illinois, the Corinth camp likely came into existence as early as September. Initially housed in army tents no longer considered serviceable for Union troops, the freedmen were soon set to work downing trees and clearing land on which to build cabins and lay out streets, which were named for Union generals. Eventually the freedmen also built a four-room school, a commissary, a hospital, a church and an office. The entire camp was divided into wards, complete with ward masters and a police force.<\/p><p>In late 1862 the American Missionary Association sent its first volunteers to Corinth to help care for, educate and minister to the freedmen. In a memoir written years after the war, one such missionary recalled her experience. \"When brought face to face with the slaves,\" she wrote, \"it was like the discovery of a new race.\" The men and women who came to Corinth generally shared a paternalistic optimism and viewed the freedmen as childlike in their enthusiasm for both education and salvation.<\/p><p>The freedmen's thirst for knowledge was undeniable. \"You will find them every hour of daylight, at their books,\" observed the Rev. Edward Pierce in March of 1863. \"We cannot enter a cabin, or tent, but that we see from one to three with books.\" Within no time Pierce and his wife had more than 150 students, and by the end of the summer, the addition of more missionaries enabled the school to accommodate between 300 and 400 children as well as 60 adults at a night school. In August, one of the teachers estimated that as many as 1,000 freedmen had learned to read in the Corinth camp.<\/p><p>Organized religion followed closely on the heels of formal education. Reverend Olds \"saw an earnestness in reference to the Christian life that I have seldom seen. And as I saw their deep earnestness & heard their hearty responses,\" he said, \"I was led to ask where can we find a more impressible people than these?\"<\/p><p>The population of the camp fluctuated between 1,500 and 6,000, as large groups undertook assignments for the Union Army or contracted to work on local plantations. In March 1863, for example, the camp was home to 658 men, 1,440 women and 1,559 children. Among the men were 36 blacksmiths, 48 carpenters, 180 teamsters and 200 cooks. The female ranks included 80 seamstresses, 150 laundresses and 600 cooks. Two-thirds of the men and three-quarters of the women were married, and seven in eight women had children. According to John Eaton's records, the camp had experienced 900 cases of illness, 189 deaths and 45 births.<\/p><p>Life at Corinth changed dramatically after a May 1863 visit by Adj. Gen. Lorenzo Thomas, who was intent on recruiting thousands of contrabands for his newly formed black regiments. With the organization of the 1st Alabama Infantry of African Descent, later renamed the 55th United States Colored Troops, the camp lost most of its able-bodied men.<\/p><p>Their departure to fight left only the women, the young, the old and the infirm to carry on Eaton's ambitious agricultural program, which rested on the cooperative farming of large tracts of abandoned and confiscated land. The program put 400 acres under cultivation, 300 for cotton and 100 for vegetables. Each cabin also had its own subsistence garden. By May 1863, the success of the agricultural program and the presence of a multitude of skilled artisans produced a clear monthly profit of $4,000 to $5,000 for the government, as well as an admirably independent community that Eaton hoped might serve as a model for other camps.<\/p><p>Unfortunately, the success of the Corinth camp proved short-lived. Plans for a winter campaign by Union forces in January 1864 provided a grim reminder that the fate of the freedmen was always secondary to the triumph of the Union cause. The order to relocate the camp's inhabitants 93 miles westward, to Memphis, \"fell like a bomb-shell among our contented people,\" lamented one missionary, \"but military orders are preemptory,\" and they \"must be obeyed.\" The freedmen left their \"well-organized village,\" gardens and farms to tdiv><\/p><p>The move from Corinth destroyed the spirit that had animated the freedmen's success. Some of the new refugees found work on confiscated plantations or in Memphis, but most lived in one of several camps surrounding the city.<\/p><p>\"The destruction of the Corinth camp,\" noted one historian, \"was one of the tragedies of the Civil War.\" Eaton's plan for large-scale cooperative farming fell victim to a bitter struggle between the War and Treasury departments over the leasing of plantations and was never implemented elsewhere. And no more than one or two other camps were able to replicate the strong civilian leadership, well-planned and policed living environment, and emphasis on education that made Corinth a success.<\/p><p>Had the government learned from the model fashioned in northern Mississippi between the fall of 1862 and early 1864, the newly freed slaves might well have enjoyed a far easier transition to life in postwar America.<\/p><p>Sources: Joseph E.

Scared of what people will think, scared it makes me look weak or unprofessional,\" she writes.<\/p><p>\"When friends or comics ask why we broke up, it's not easy or comfortable to reply; it doesn't seem like the appropriate thing to say at a stand-up show, a party or a wedding. It's embarrassing. I feel stupid. After being verbally, physically abused and raped, I dated him for two more months. It's not simple.\"<\/p><p>Ultimately, Stelling couldn't exclude such a significant piece of her story from her onstage persona, even if it meant risking ridicule from the close-knit comedy community.<\/p><p>\"After I broke up with him, he said, 'You're very open and honest in your stand-up, and I just ask that you consider me when you talk about your ex because everyone knows who you're talking about.' And I abided. I wrote vague jokes because we both live in L.A., and I didn't want to hurt him, start a war, press charges, be interrogated or harassed by him or his friends and family. I wanted to move on and forget because I didn't understand,\" Stelling shares.<\/p><p>\"I don't want revenge or to hurt him now, but it's unhealthy to keep this inside because my stand-up is pulled directly from my life.

(Sarah Parnass\/The Washington Post)<\/p><p>The House Select Committee on Blumenthal, as some are now calling it, came to order at 10 a.m. Lawmakers didn't finish questioning Hillary Clinton until 11 hours later \u2014 just after the Democratic presidential candidate succumbed to a coughing fit.<\/p><p>In that period of time, the name of Sidney Blumenthal was invoked more than 75 times, and scores of questions were asked about the longtime Clinton friend. By lunchtime, Blumenthal had been invoked 49 times \u2014 exactly the number of mentions of J. Christopher Stevens, the ambassador to Libya whose death in Benghazi is the supposed subject of the congressional probe. The other three Americans slain in Benghazi \u2014 Sean Smith, Glen Doherty, Tyrone Woods \u2014 got seven or eight mentions apiece, then-CIA director David Petraeus and former defense secretary Robert Gates each got two, and then-Defense Secretary Leon Panetta had none.<\/p><p>Dana Milbank writes about political theater in the nation's capital. He joined the Post as a political reporter in 2000.<\/p><p>Chairman Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.), reading from Blumenthal's e-mails to Clinton as if he were the teacher who had intercepted a note passed between two high school kids, said Blumenthal referred to Gates as \"a mean, vicious little\"\u2014 Gowdy paused. \"I'm not going to say the word, but he did.\"<\/p><p>He also quoted Blumenthal referring to then- national security adviser Thomas E. Donilon's \"babbling rhetoric,\" and he said Blumenthal had referred to \"Obama\" (he \"left the 'president' part out\") and \"his political cronies in the White House and Chicago.\"<\/p><p>Clinton refused to get riled. \"I don't know what this line of questioning does to help us get to the bottom of deaths of four Americans,\" she said.<\/p><p>But Gowdy knew. A couple of minutes later, he announced: \"I'll tell you what: If you think you've heard about Sidney Blumenthal so far, wait until the next round.\"<\/p><p>He and his colleagues made good on that statement, posing questions on a Blumenthal visit to Clinton's home, about his work for the Clinton Foundation, his business interests, his attempt to get a job at the State Department and his communication with the former secretary of state over matters as mundane as her new iPad. They were particularly concerned with whether Blumenthal's advice to Clinton on Libya was \"unsolicited.\"<\/p><p>The Blumenthal focus shows that, after 17 months of probing Clinton, the Benghazi committee hasn't come up with much. Blumenthal has been a Clinton hatchet man for years, and he has an unsavory reputation. The very mention of his name (he was prominent during the Monica Lewinsky scandal) lends a whiff of skulduggery to any situation.<\/p><p>But injecting Blumenthal as a central character in the Benghazi probe doesn't help Republicans demonstrate that Clinton did wrong. And the justification for invoking him \u2014 to demonstrate that Clinton had more contact with him than with Stevens \u2014 is a stretch. Whatever else one thinks of the former journalist \u2014 I've clashed with him over the years \u2014 he had nothing to do with what happened in Libya on Sept. 11 and 12, 2012.<\/p><p>Rep. Mike Pompeo (R-Kan.) acted as if he had found a video of Blumenthal attacking the compound himself. Pompeo, who had previously made the false allegation that Clinton got \"most of her intelligence\" on Libya from Blumenthal, asked whether Stevens had Clinton's personal e-mail, her cellphone number, fax or home address or visited her at home. \"Mr. Blumenthal had each of those and did each of those things,\" Pompeo concluded.<\/p><p>Rep. Peter J. Roskam (R-Ill.) thought he saw a smoking gun in an e-mail correspondence from August 2011 in which Blumenthal encouraged Clinton to \"make a public statement before the cameras\" when Libyan leader Moammar Gaddafi was deposed.<\/p><p>\"Two months before the end of the Gaddafi regime and you're already planning on how to make your statement dramatic to maximize political gain,\" Roskam scolded.<\/p><p>Relevance to the Benghazi attack? None.<\/p><p>Gowdy, for his part, found it damning that Clinton aides passed along some of Blumenthal's advice (which he got from a former intelligence official) to people including Stevens. \"It's relevant because our ambassador was asked to read and respond to Sidney Blumenthal's drivel,\" the chairman said, \"in some instances on the very same day he was asking for security.\"<\/p><p>Rep. Adam B. Schiff (Calif.), a Democrat, observed that for all the time the panel has spent on Blumenthal, you'd think \"that he was in Benghazi on the night, manning the barricades.\" During private testimony from Blumenthal, to which he was summoned by federal marshals, Republicans asked more than 160 questions about Blumenthal's associations with Bill and Hillary Clinton but fewer than 20 about the Benghazi attacks.<\/p><p>Schiff and Rep. Elijah E. Cummings (Md.), the ranking Democrat, proposed that Republicans, rather than selectively releasing Blumenthal's e-mails, come clean about their interest in him and make public the entire transcript of his testimony.

Fewer voters than expected turned out.<\/p><p>Editor's note: John Avlon is a CNN contributor and senior political columnist for Newsweek and The Daily Beast. He is co-editor of the book \"Deadline Artists: America's Greatest Newspaper Columns.\"<\/p><p>(CNN) -- Beneath Rick Santorum's stunning three-state sweep on Tuesday stands another stubborn sign of dissatisfaction with the status quo: Republican turnout is down.<\/p><p>I'm talking embarrassingly, disturbingly, hey-don't-you-know-it's-an-election-year bad. It is a sign of a serious enthusiasm gap among the rank and file, and a particularly bad omen for Mitt Romney and the GOP in the general election.<\/p><p>Here's the tale of the tape, state by state, beginning with Tuesday night: Minnesota had just more than 47,000 people turn out for its caucuses this year -- four years ago it was nearly 63,000 -- and Romney came in first, not a distant third as he did Tuesday night. In Colorado, more than 70,000 people turned out for its caucus in 2008 -- but in 2012 it was 65,000. And Missouri -- even making a generous discount for the fact that this was an entirely symbolic contest -- had 232,000 people turn out, less than half the number who did four years ago.<\/p><p>Even with months of pre-primary hype and attention solely devoted to the Republican field, turnout in this election cycle essentially flat-lined. In Iowa, a little more than 121,000 people voted, compared with nearly 119,000 four years before, when action in the Democratic caucuses absorbed most of the attention.<\/p><p>In New Hampshire, the same dynamic applied -- 245,000 voters turned out in 2012, compared with 241,000 four years before, despite Republicans being the only game in town and independents making up 47% of the total turnout in 2012, according to CNN exit polls. Take out the independent voters and you've got a deep net decline.<\/p><p>Always proudly rebellious, South Carolina has been the great outlier in this election cycle. With Newt Gingrich making an all-out push for conservatives in a conservative state, turnout was up almost 150,000 over four years before.<\/p><p>But in Florida, the decline became unmistakable. Maybe it decreased because the Romney and Gingrich campaigns, plus super PACS, spent more than $18 million in the Sunshine State on TV ads, of which 93% were negative in the last week alone, according to the Campaign Media Analysis Group. After all, negative ads depress turnout. But after all the mud was thrown, 1.6 million people turned out in the nation's fourth largest state, which might sound impressive until you compare it with the nearly 2 million who turned out in 2008.<\/p><p>Nevada was even worse, with 32,894 people turning out to vote in a state with more than 465,000 registered Republicans. Four years before, more than 44,300 participated in the caucus. Turnout was down more than 25% despite the GOP caucuses being the only game in town. Party officials were expecting a turnout of more than 70,000.<\/p><p>All this should be a wake-up call for the GOP. Despite an enormous amount of national media attention devoted to each of the states to date, the response has been a notable yawn among the Republican rank and file.<\/p><p>The turnout numbers are even worse when you compare them with the number of registered Republicans in each state that has voted to date.<\/p><p>The caucuses in particular bring out an unrepresentative sample of a state's Republican Party. For all the grass-roots romanticism, there has got to be a better way to pick a presidential nominee.<\/p><p>But the news is worst for Romney, long the presumptive front-runner in a party that tends to reward the man next in line.<\/p><p>\"Reluctantly Romney\" could be a bumper sticker, even for his supporters. The former Massachusetts governor has found it difficult to climb above 35% in national polls, meaning that a majority of Republicans still support someone else in a notably weak field. His vote margins and totals lag behind those of four years before, when he lost the nomination to John McCain in a crowded and comparatively competent field, although Minnesota is the first state he won in '08 and lost in 2012.<\/p><p>You reap what you sow, and part of the reason turnout is down is directly related to the problem of polarization. The Republican Party is more ideologically polarized than at any time in recent history. Therefore, it put up more purely right-wing candidates than it did four years before, when center-right leaders such as McCain and Rudy Giuliani were also in the race. A bigger tent inspired bigger turnout.<\/p><p>But the other reason is simple dissatisfaction with the candidates.<\/p><p>Republicans seem united in their anger against the president -- like the Democrats in 2004 -- but they are uninspired by their options. Draft movements for fantasy candidates ranging from Chris Christie to Mitch Daniels to Paul Ryan and even Jeb Bush have started and failed. Some party leaders show more enthusiasm for a hypothetical 2016 crop of candidates, including Marco Rubio and Bobby Jindal, than they do for the flawed choices before them in this election. Divided and dispirited is an odd place for the Republican Party to be so soon after the enthusiasms of the 2010 tea party-driven election.<\/p><p>The bottom line is that voter turnout matters. And what should be most troubling for Republicans is that this enthusiasm gap among the conservative base is accompanied by a lack of candidates who might appeal to independents and centrist swing voters in the general election. It is a double barrel of bad news for the Republican Party. The numbers can be spun and rationalized by professional partisan operatives all day long, but the fact remains -- voters just aren't turning out to cast their votes for this crop of conservative candidates in 2012.<\/p><p>Follow CNN Opinion on Twitter.<\/p><p>Join the conversation on Facebook.<\/p><p>The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John Avlon.","391":"Friday, May 5th 2000, 2:12AM<\/p><p>GLADIATOR. With Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, Connie Nielsen, Oliver Reed. Directed by Ridley Scott. At area theaters. Running time: 154 mins. Rated R: Gory violence, incest theme. 3 1\/2 Stars.<\/p><p>If there's a soft spot in your heart for the sword-&-sandal epic - and from the star rating above, I think you can guess where I stand - then you'll swoon with giddy delight over \"Gladiator,\" a sweaty, stylish hunkfest that takes you back to the days of \"Ben-Hur,\" \"Spartacus\" and the so recently departed Steve Reeves.<\/p><p>From his biceps to his gluteus, Maximus is maximus. This Roman general turned slave turned gladiator hasn't a shred of humor, but then, he doesn't have time for idle nonsense when he's lopping off heads all day. (The head-lopping is apparently his signature, like the mark of Zorro.)<\/p><p>In director Ridley Scott's thrilling, burnished epic, Maximus no sooner serves the empire by leveling Germania during a snowstorm than Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) tosses him a promotion he doesn't want - to succeed the aged emperor and whip Rome back into shape. All Maximus wants is to go home to his wife and child in the suburbs.<\/p><p>The careworn Russell Crowe is physically and temperamentally perfect for the part of Maximus. Still carrying some of the weight he packed on for \"The Insider,\" he's no gym-toned pretty boy. He's solid, beefy, rough-hewn, creaking along in his heavy leather costume, with a look on his puss of weary disdain.<\/p><p>What makes him sexy is his sense of honor and loyalty: \"What we do in life echoes in eternity!\" Anyway, it can't be his hygiene, although he is frequently bathed in a sanctifying golden glow.<\/p><p>After a coup by the emperor's weak-kneed son, Commodus (a whiny, surprisingly fleshy Joaquin Phoenix), Maximus' fortunes change. He winds up being thrown to the tigers, two shows daily, in Rome's Colosseum, the entertainment complex of its day.<\/p><p>Crowe, like his character, must grimly come to terms with the fact that, actor or gladiator, it's all about showmanship. Give the crowd what it wants, either at the multiplex or in the arena, and you can write your own ticket.<\/p><p>\"I have power only to amuse the mob,\" he spits contemptuously like a Shakespearean actor reduced to dinner theater.<\/p><p>The plot, about avenging honor, provides brief respite between an array of hand-to-hand battles that are pitched so furiously that individual components barely register; they're subliminal suggestions of computer-assisted carnage, with Jackson Pollock sprays of blood. For fans of the genre, yes, this is a good thing.<\/p><p>Connie Nielsen plays Commodus' sister and possible love interest for Maximus once his family is dispatched (politics, you know). Nielsen's costumes are laced up like bondage gear, and there is a tantalizing hint of romance past.<\/p><p>But the camera only has eyes for Crowe. The glowering! The seething! The hooded gaze! The quiet suffering! (Watch him carve away a tattoo he no longer has use for. No anesthetic! No disinfectant!)<\/p><p>The supporting cast makes for a gauntlet of worthy friends and adversaries, all of them thinkers, including Derek Jacobi (\"I, Claudius\") as a senator, Djimon Hounsou (\"Amistad\") as a fellow gladiator and Oliver Reed, who died with two days to go on the shoot, looking a little woozy as a gladiator entrepreneur.<\/p><p>Reed's character is the one most in touch with the movie's premise - that entertainment is the goal, and a worthy one at that.","392":"12\/28\/2015 AT 04:50 PM EST<\/p><p>Like a lot of professional funny people, Beth Stelling is used to getting candid about her life offstage. Recently, the Los Angeles based-comedian started working one very personal, serious experience into her routine.<\/p><p>on Monday to open up about a violent relationship with an ex boyfriend, sharing photos of her bruised arms and legs and explaining why she has decided to include discussions of the abuse in her stand-up.<\/p><p>\"Same girl in all of these photos (me). I've had an amazing year, and you've seen the highlights here, so these photos are an uncommon thing to share but not an uncommon issue,\" Stelling captions a collage of photos of her bruises and her onstage smile.<\/p><p>The comic, who released her album<\/p><p>this fall and has a Comedy Central special, was hesitant to openly talk about the abuse, especially within her professional world.<\/p><p>\"There are many reasons not to make an abusive relationship public, mostly fear. Scared of what people will think, scared it makes me look weak or unprofessional,\" she writes.<\/p><p>\"When friends or comics ask why we broke up, it's not easy or comfortable to reply; it doesn't seem like the appropriate thing to say at a stand-up show, a party or a wedding. It's embarrassing. I feel stupid. After being verbally, physically abused and raped, I dated him for two more months. It's not simple.\"<\/p><p>Ultimately, Stelling couldn't exclude such a significant piece of her story from her onstage persona, even if it meant risking ridicule from the close-knit comedy community.<\/p><p>\"After I broke up with him, he said, 'You're very open and honest in your stand-up, and I just ask that you consider me when you talk about your ex because everyone knows who you're talking about.' And I abided. I wrote vague jokes because we both live in L.A., and I didn't want to hurt him, start a war, press charges, be interrogated or harassed by him or his friends and family. I wanted to move on and forget because I didn't understand,\" Stelling shares.<\/p><p>\"I don't want revenge or to hurt him now, but it's unhealthy to keep this inside because my stand-up is pulled directly from my life. It's how I make my living. My personal is my professional. That is how I've always been; I make dark, funny. So now I'm allowing this to be part of my story.\"<\/p><p>Stelling says she's already started joking about the relationship and asked her followers to \"have the courage to listen and accept.\"<\/p><p>So far, the funny lady has been getting a positive response to her openness at the mic.<\/p><p>\"Already since talking about this onstage, many women have come to me after shows asking me to keep doing it,\" she says on Instagram. \"Men have shown their solidarity.\"","393":"Kenneth Ng calls his website a primer for tourists headed to<\/p><p>, but Fodor's it ain't.<\/p><p>The California State University at Northridge professor's site is a one-stop shop for men drawn to the country's sex tourism industry. Dotted with pictures of scantily clad women, the website, BigBabyKenny, advises would-be Johns on the art of negotiating with prostitutes. \"Start with a compliment,\" Ng advises.<\/p><p>Needless to say, Ng's website is causing headaches for Northridge administrators. First publicized by the Los Angeles Daily News, the economics professor's site has drawn a wave of unwelcome attention, forcing administrators to at once criticize its content and defend Ng's right to publish freely on his own time without university resources.<\/p><p>\"Until we find representative evidence that it infringes upon the work he does at the university itself, there's not much we can do about it,\" said Harold Hellenbrand, Northridge's provost.<\/p><p>There may be subtlety in Hellenbrand's words, but his message is clear: If BigBabyKenny infringes on Ng's ability to effectively do his job, then Northridge's position will change. Ng has already said his site is run through a separate server not connected to the university, but Northridge officials might still make a case that the site has interfered with his job. Asked if students complaining that they were no longer comfortable in Ng's class would compel Northridge to demand the site be taken down, Hellenbrand said \"I'm not inviting complaints, but you just hit on the key issue.\"<\/p><p>\"If [running the site is] what he wants to do, and at the same time he wants to educate students and students flock away, then that would create a problem,\" Hellenbrand said.<\/p><p>How Ng came to be identified as the author of BigBabyKenny is a story in itself. A frequent tourist of Thailand, Ng took to blogging on the website of a Bangkok bar called Big Mango Bar. In one controversial post, Ng advised men to seek women near a particular Buddhist shrine.<\/p><p>\"The naysayers will say its creepy to be hanging around the Muariti Shrine, hitting on the emotionally vulnerable girls desperately praying and paying Buddha for a better love life but I beg to differ. Buddha works in mysterious ways,\" he wrote.<\/p><p>Perturbed by the post, the bar owners removed it. That led Ng to start his own site, prompting what Ng describes as a concerted effort by the owners to publicize his penchant for writing about prostitutes. They sent mass e-mails to faculty listed in Northridge's directory, and also posted on RateMyProfessor.com, warning students about Ng, he said.<\/p><p>Ng readily defends the content of his site and says he has no intention of taking it down.<\/p><p>\"The university has no stake in this one way or the other, and besides, professors can say whatever they want,\" said Ng, a tenured associate professor of economics.<\/p><p>Some question whether Ng has crossed a gray legal line, however, by advising men on sex tourism. Patrick Trueman, a former U.S. justice department official, notes that there are several federal statutes that could come into play. Within U.S. Code 18 are two sections \u2013 2422 (a) and 2422 (b) \u2013 that specifically prohibit anyone from \"enticing or coercing a person\" to travel internationally in pursuit of prostitutes. Moreover, one section specifically prohibits the use of the Internet to lure people.<\/p><p>While prostitution may be tolerated in Thailand, that's immaterial under the federal code, Trueman said.<\/p><p>\"Inducing and enticing? Isn't that what this guy's doing?\" said Trueman, former chief of the Justice Department's Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section in the Criminal Division.<\/p><p>Trueman, now a lawyer specializing in sex trafficking and child abuse cases, said there would likely be debate about whether talking about procuring prostitutes online and actually arranging prostitutes for a person should be treated differently under the law.<\/p><p>\"Given how lax the fed government is on these crimes, they may not charge somebody unless they are more directly involved,\" he said. \"That's not to say this person couldn't be charged, and as I read it they could be charged.\"<\/p><p>Beyond the legal implications, critics have already attacked Ng on moral grounds. John Foubert, an Oklahoma State University professor who researches sex trafficking, argues that women \u2013 often minors \u2013 are forced into the sex tourism industry and often have trouble escaping it. Even if Ng is operating within the bounds of the law, Northridge officials have an ethical problem they've yet to face, Foubert said.<\/p><p>\"Do they want to live with the blood on their hands of these girls that are being essentially raped by these men, who are going down and purchasing sex? I think that's a larger question,\" said Foubert, an associate professor of college student development.<\/p><p>Ng said he allows anything to be written on his site, so long as it doesn't involve pedophilia or underage sex. He does, however, write about how difficult it is to effectively negotiate with a \"half or sometimes fully naked teenage girl\" when she's \"expertly gyrating\" on a man's lap.<\/p><p>While his critics have been speaking out since fall, Ng said he has yet to hear from a student who expressed discomfort about his website.<\/p><p>\"The job of the university is to expose students to the world \u2013 not just a politically correct view of the world and not just the good parts of the world,\" he said. \"If a student reads that [site], I personally think it's good for them. They learn about something out there; maybe they disapprove of it and they don't think it's good.\"<\/p><p>You share in the USA TODAY community, so please keep your comments smart and civil.

When the shoebox-shaped and nearly shoebox-size panini shop opened on Bedford Street 15 years ago, there was nothing quite like it in New York, a restaurant that kept things simple and kept prices low, serving flavorful food in a room that was just adorable enough that you could decide, midmeal, that maybe the two of you squeezed into the counter were there on a date, and not just grabbing a bite.<\/p><p>You have to fire up the Wayback Machine to better understand how 'ino helped change how this city eats. Fifteen years ago, New York was a bistro town. There was the old guard: Blue Ribbon, Le Gamin, Jules, Lucky Strike, Raoul's and a dozen others. Then in 1997, a newcomer opened in SoHo named Balthazar, which raised the stakes with its set direction and unlisted reservation line. Balthazar was white-hot: it had perfectly distressed mirrors, fresh and crusty bread, and although it was impossible to get a table unless you knew somebody who knew somebody, you could always go at midnight and eat at the bar.<\/p><p>Soon, New York was lousy with bistros. It was a good era if you wanted a kir, steak frites, escargot, fris\u00e9e lardon, profiteroles. Authenticity, or some version of it, was the point. Everybody was pressing butter into little ramekins to be served at room temperature, changing the paper covering the tablecloths before serving dessert.<\/p><p>Honestly, it was really fun. The restaurants were lively, intimate, sexy. So what if you could recite the menu before you set foot in the door? But if you were a young chef with a measure of vision and creativity, you were stuck either making onion soup and beet salad with goat cheese. Or you worked on the line executing the vision and creativity of an older chef in Midtown or TriBeCa. Prune hadn't yet opened. Neither had Diner. Brooklyn didn't have much of a food scene outside the restaurant row on Smith Street, which was anchored by Patois, a bistro. If you went to Williamsburg, it was to go to a party or to go dancing, not to eat. This was the landscape when Jason and Jennifer Denton opened 'ino on a quiet street in the West Village. The kitchen in the back was the size of a D.J. booth and used the technology of induction burners, which was novel at the time: it was a paninoteca that looked as if it belonged in New York rather than being shipped, tile by mirrored tile, from Milan.<\/p><p>The culinary vocabulary was Italian, but it wasn't sepia-toned and sentimental. Instead, there was a focus on ingredients at a time when, in New York at least, few people cared. It had simple food done well, and sometimes you encountered flavors that weren't lifted out of the songbook. I still have a 13-year-old memory of sharing a shredded duck sandwich with sweet relish, a combination that is about as authentically Italian as a functioning parliament. You could go to 'ino to get something familiar (prosciutto and cheese will never get old), but you could also try something new.<\/p><p>'Ino was a casual joint with integrity, an easygoing place where you could eat well as long as you didn't mind the wait. Today, we take this combination for granted, and expect all kitchens to put some effort into sourcing and display a little creativity no matter how limited the resources. That we do owes a little bit to 'ino.","395":"Here are top moments from the House Select Committee hearing on Benghazi where former secretary of state Hillary Clinton testified.

Tight end Vernon Davis? He has eight targets in the past three games.<\/p><p>It's hard to argue with Kaepernick's pecking order, given the results.<\/p><p>In a 41-34 win over the Patriots on Sunday, Crabtree (7 catches, 107 yards, 2 TDs) was featured on the 49ers' first possession - a tone-setting 63-yard touchdown march - with drive-opening catches of 11 and 13 yards. Kaepernick also threw his final pass to Crabtree, a 38-yard game-winner on a play that wasn't designed for San Francisco's No. 1 wide receiver.<\/p><p>In his past three games, Crabtree has 23 catches for 301 yards and two touchdowns with 90-plus receiving yards in each game. Prior to his streak, he had 90-plus receiving yards in five of the first 53 games of his four-year career.<\/p><p>In his five starts, Kaepernick has a 113.6 rating when targeting Crabtree, who has helped earn his confidence with reliable hands. According to Pro Football Focus, Crabtree has three drops in Kaepernick's starts, an impressive figure given the heat the Howitzer-armed quarterback puts on his throws.<\/p><p>On KNBR Tuesday, Harbaugh, who famously declared in the offseason Crabtree had the best hands he'd ever seen, crowed a bit when asked if there was a special Kaepernick-Crabtree chemistry.<\/p><p>\"Yeah, I think there is,\" Harbaugh said. \"But Michael has been doing this all year now. Talked about it every week, the ability to catch, nobody catches the ball better than Michael Crabtree. I think back to last summer when we were talking about the same topic. It might have even been on this show. A lot of people 'What? The greatest hands you've ever seen?' Nobody mentions that any more. Boy, the evidence sure is there.\"<\/p><p>With at least 10 catches and 132 yards over the final two regular-season games, Crabtree (73 catches, 868 yards) would become the 49ers' first 1,000-yard receiver since Terrell Owens in 2003 and will have the most receptions since Owens hauled in 100 in 2002.<\/p><p>Davis, who had team-highs in targets (eight), receptions (six) and yards (83) in Kaepernick's first start against Chicago last month, has since become an afterthought. He had one catch for 10 yards against the Patriots, and four catches, 29 yards and nine targets over the last four games.<\/p><p>Davis said he's yet to establish a chemistry with Kaepernick that matches the connection he had with former starter Alex Smith.<\/p><p>\"You have to develop that chemistry, that bond so you can be on the same page,\" Davis said. \"That's something me and Kaep don't have right now. We don't have it. You have to expect it because he just stepped in. Me and Alex, we've been here.\"<\/p><p>Asked why Crabtree has been quick to get on the same page, Davis said the red-hot wide receiver has been running shorter routes. However, he also noted, as Kaepernick did Sunday night, that Crabtree has earned his targets by breaking free from coverage.<\/p><p>\"Crab is a pretty good route runner,\" Davis said. \"He's getting open and Kaep is finding him.\"<\/p><p>Eric Branch is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.

Directed by Ridley Scott. At area theaters. Running time: 154 mins. Rated R: Gory violence, incest theme. 3 1\/2 Stars.<\/p><p>If there's a soft spot in your heart for the sword-&-sandal epic - and from the star rating above, I think you can guess where I stand - then you'll swoon with giddy delight over \"Gladiator,\" a sweaty, stylish hunkfest that takes you back to the days of \"Ben-Hur,\" \"Spartacus\" and the so recently departed Steve Reeves.<\/p><p>From his biceps to his gluteus, Maximus is maximus. This Roman general turned slave turned gladiator hasn't a shred of humor, but then, he doesn't have time for idle nonsense when he's lopping off heads all day. (The head-lopping is apparently his signature, like the mark of Zorro.)<\/p><p>In director Ridley Scott's thrilling, burnished epic, Maximus no sooner serves the empire by leveling Germania during a snowstorm than Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) tosses him a promotion he doesn't want - to succeed the aged emperor and whip Rome back into shape. All Maximus wants is to go home to his wife and child in the suburbs.<\/p><p>The careworn Russell Crowe is physically and temperamentally perfect for the part of Maximus. Still carrying some of the weight he packed on for \"The Insider,\" he's no gym-toned pretty boy. He's solid, beefy, rough-hewn, creaking along in his heavy leather costume, with a look on his puss of weary disdain.<\/p><p>What makes him sexy is his sense of honor and loyalty: \"What we do in life echoes in eternity!\" Anyway, it can't be his hygiene, although he is frequently bathed in a sanctifying golden glow.<\/p><p>After a coup by the emperor's weak-kneed son, Commodus (a whiny, surprisingly fleshy Joaquin Phoenix), Maximus' fortunes change. He winds up being thrown to the tigers, two shows daily, in Rome's Colosseum, the entertainment complex of its day.<\/p><p>Crowe, like his character, must grimly come to terms with the fact that, actor or gladiator, it's all about showmanship. Give the crowd what it wants, either at the multiplex or in the arena, and you can write your own ticket.<\/p><p>\"I have power only to amuse the mob,\" he spits contemptuously like a Shakespearean actor reduced to dinner theater.<\/p><p>The plot, about avenging honor, provides brief respite between an array of hand-to-hand battles that are pitched so furiously that individual components barely register; they're subliminal suggestions of computer-assisted carnage, with Jackson Pollock sprays of blood. For fans of the genre, yes, this is a good thing.<\/p><p>Connie Nielsen plays Commodus' sister and possible love interest for Maximus once his family is dispatched (politics, you know). Nielsen's costumes are laced up like bondage gear, and there is a tantalizing hint of romance past.<\/p><p>But the camera only has eyes for Crowe. The glowering! The seething! The hooded gaze! The quiet suffering! (Watch him carve away a tattoo he no longer has use for. No anesthetic! No disinfectant!)<\/p><p>The supporting cast makes for a gauntlet of worthy friends and adversaries, all of them thinkers, including Derek Jacobi (\"I, Claudius\") as a senator, Djimon Hounsou (\"Amistad\") as a fellow gladiator and Oliver Reed, who died with two days to go on the shoot, looking a little woozy as a gladiator entrepreneur.<\/p><p>Reed's character is the one most in touch with the movie's premise - that entertainment is the goal, and a worthy one at that.","403":"Now that Newt Gingrich has vaulted into the lead in the Republican presidential stakes, he's going to be seeing a lot more of this:<\/p><p>Calling it the \"dumbest thing\" he has done in recent years isn't enough. This is not going away.<\/p><p>But, Newt can turn his pas-de-deux on the loveseat with Nancy into an opportunity to promote a consistent and electable political message.<\/p><p>Because he will be asked about this at every turn, Newt will have the air time and the opportunity to tell the truth on climate change\u2014based upon real science\u2014and to interface it with a limited-government philosophy. The two are easy to do.<\/p><p>Start with the obvious. Instead of waffling on the subject, he could just point out that earth's surface temperature is about 1\u00b0C warmer than it was a century ago. There were two periods of warming, the first from about 1910 through 1945, and the second from the mid-1970s to the late-1990s. They were both roughly the same magnitude. Because the first one was long before we put the majority of fossil carbon into the atmosphere, Newt can say\u2014with scientific authority\u2014that the magnitude of 'natural' climate change is likely to be at least as large as what humans have done.<\/p><p>Then Newt should proceed to the future. It's not the heat, it's the sensitivity. How much it will warm in the future is a function of how sensitive the atmosphere is to doubling atmospheric carbon dioxide. There are a number of independent arguments now coming together showing that this value may have been overestimated. The reference for the most recent is a November issue of Science.<\/p><p>Next, a little refreshing honesty: in 2009, the House of Representatives passed a cap-and-trade bill (which the Senate did not) commanding that the average american\u201438 years from now\u2014be allowed the carbon dioxide emissions of the average citizen in 1867. Prior to its passage, Newt was undeniably for such a system. Newt could call that that the \"second dumbest thing\" he has done and be finished with it.<\/p><p>After setting the record straight, how about interjecting his own political philosophy? When asked what to do about global warming, he should give the honest answer: if the atmosphere indeed is not as sensitive to carbon dioxide changes as previously thought, the correct response is nothing.<\/p><p>That's because \"nothing\" really means something. Newt should channel his historian. When markets are free, capital supports innovation more efficiently than when they aren't. Think about the remarkable changes in energy and technology in the last 100 years. Isn't it rather obvious that the same will occur in the next century, if only we don't hinder capital development? Newt might even use the catchy saw (first sloganed by Northern Illinois Gas in 1972) the future belongs to the efficient, and that there are impressive market forces that advantage those who produce things efficiently or produce efficient things.<\/p><p>When the doomsayers say Newt is believing in a Deus ex machine to dramatically cut carbon dioxide emissions, he might point out that those were the same folks who, only a very few years ago, told us we were running out of natural gas. Innovation and capital revolutionized drilling and fracturing shale, and we now know we have literally hundreds of years of it under our feet. There are a lot more voters and delegates around the country who will benefit from the shale revolution than there are in ethanol-addicted Iowa.","404":"Kenneth Ng calls his website a primer for tourists headed to<\/p><p>, but Fodor's it ain't.<\/p><p>The California State University at Northridge professor's site is a one-stop shop for men drawn to the country's sex tourism industry.

It's been nearly two decades since pictures of this sort were produced with any regularity by the studio system, and a lot longer since they were stateside successes. Many of the attempts in recent years have been, at best, mid-budget passion projects with circumscribed audiences (Stallone's own<\/p><p>which topped out at $42 million domestically) or post-modern winks (the French-language \"JCVD\" from 2008, a hostage movie in which Jean-Claude Van Damme plays a version of himself). The few large-scale attempts, like \"The A-Team,\" underperformed. (The biceps-and-bullets remake grossed $77 million domestically, a number that will likely be easily surpassed by \"The Expendables.\")<\/p><p>But the Stallone picture -- with its hard-charging, take-no-prisoners patriotism unbothered by the vagaries of the real world (it takes place in a fictional country, for starters) and its caricature of freedom-hating enemies (\"We will kill this American disease,\" as the TV spot enticed us) -- planted itself squarely in the old-school genre. And this weekend, the movie showed that there's life in that category yet. That \"Scott Pilgrim vs. the World,\" the tongue-in-cheek, pop-culture-referential, decidedly 2010 creation -- the one for, of and by arch fanboys -- trailed well behind \"The Expendables\" only drove home the point more loudly.<\/p><p>On one hand, it's understandable that a movie of easy American heroism (OK, first-world Western heroism) would catch on. In fact, it's surprising it didn't happen sooner. Apple-pie-patriotism already is behind the success of a cable news network and supports large sections of the contemporary country music industry. Why not a film hit too?<\/p><p>But among all the factors to which one might point in explaining the success of \"The Expendables\" -- a cast harvested from so many demographics and eras; a moviegoer backlash to 3-D and CG effects -- it somehow doesn't feel that the demand for neat heroes and villains is one of them.<\/p><p>Norris and his ilk would submit that in our current period of ideological and geopolitical upheaval, in a time of blurry lines between enemies and friends in places such as Afghanistan and Iraq, that black-and-white heroes slake a patriotic thirst (and that, indeed, the movie-going world can support a lot more of them). But history argues the opposite: Those movies succeed when the culture at large is filled with clear-cut distinctions. On the other hand, when the zeitgeist is more cloudy, an entirely different kind of cinema prospers.<\/p><p>The post-WWII era and its mainly straightforward distinctions between good and evil, to take an example of the former, yielded a flowering subgenre of movies with morally uncomplicated gunslingers. And 30 years later, the ideological simplicity of the Cold War and its larger-than-life Evil Empire gave rise to the very action movies on which \"Expendables\" is modeled (not to mention the ultimate in us-versus-them confections, \"Rocky IV.\" Yes, there's a Stallone-ishness to all of this). There are plenty of reasons why these types of movies faded from view in the 1990s, but the fall of the Berlin Wall and the the Soviet Union certainly played a part.<\/p><p>The examples are just as abundant on the other side. The ambiguities of the Vietnam War and the counterculture in the late 1960s and early 1970s undoubtedly offered up the moral murkiness of<\/p><p>\"Midnight Cowboy\" and scores of others. In the post-9\/11 world, meanwhile, movies like<\/p><p>-- with its themes of a destruction-bent enemy that can't be bargained with, and the question of what constitutes an acceptable ethical compromise in fighting that enemy -- have captured our imagination. You can throw<\/p><p>in there too, to the degree the movie was a contemplation of Western interests in the Middle East.<\/p><p>Political eras are, of course, rarely just one thing or another, and the movies we want to see in a given period are hardly monolithic. But as tempting as it is to infer that the success of \"The Expendables\" shows a deeper cultural need, it may well be the wrong inference. When times are confusing, we want movies to reflect that confusion, and even to make sense of it. But we probably don't want to pretend that confusion doesn't exist.<\/p><p>Photo: A scene from \"The Expendables.\" Credit: Lionsgate<\/p><p>Stallone: I'm contemplating an \"Expendables\" sequel<\/p><p>Hollywood wonders if Schwarzenegger will be back","406":"The White House tried Sunday to win support for President Obama's forthcoming budget, arguing the plan is a balanced approach to economic prosperity and warning Republicans about stonewalling negotiations and pushing a \"rejected\" Romney plan.<\/p><p>\"Right now, the approach of many Republicans, particularly the leadership in the House, is my way or the highway,\" senior White House adviser Dan Pfeiffer told \"Fox News Sunday.\" \"Their view is the only acceptable plan is to try to \u2026 essentially enact the Romney economic plan.

Within two days on the market, however, there were 10 offers. \"Our was not the highest,\" Stephanie said. \"We wrote a letter to the owners about why we liked the house.\"<\/p><p>The letter, along with a photograph of the family, worked. What drew the Stahlbergs to the house were the solar panels and the trees and bushes \u2014 raspberries, blueberries, blackberries, strawberries, grapes, apples, plums and currants \u2014 growing organically on the property. The Stahlbergs also envisioned finishing the basement bedroom and bathroom for an au pair.<\/p><p>They also fell in love with the neighborhood. They would be within walking distance to a park and two libraries with story time for children.<\/p><p>\"We were trying to look at homes where we can walk to the Metro, or bike to the city or to the Metro,\" said Stephanie, 27.<\/p><p>Sears and Montgomery Ward kit houses: Cherrydale, once abundant with cherry orchards, is a family neighborhood dating to 1893. While many neighbors have lived in the area for as long as 60 years, newcomers move in and out these days, said Kathryn Holt Springston, who worked for the Smithsonian American History Tours Office as an educational specialist and historian for 28 years. She also served as curator and director of the Arlington Historical Museum and editor of the Cherrydale Citizens' Association newsletter.<\/p><p>Single-family homes, the Arlington public schools, access to bike trails and proximity to the District draw people to the neighborhood. Sometimes, though, they move in but stay only a few years. Finding a house in Cherrydale can involve the competitive process the Stahlbergs experienced.<\/p><p>About half a mile north of the Virginia Square and Ballston Metro stations on the Orange and Silver lines, Cherrydale has a variety of residences ranging from farmhouses to bungalows to Sears and Montgomery Ward kit homes with two to five or bedrooms or sometimes more. Many date from 1900 to 1930, though some of the older houses were purchased to be torn down and replaced with larger homes, including some built as recently as this year.<\/p><p>Living there: Cherrydale lies north of Interstate 66 and south of Lorcom Lane, stretching roughly from Utah Street on the west to the northward-curving interstate on the east. The Maywood neighborhood claims the eastern half of those boundaries north of Lee Highway, lending something of an arrowhead shape to Cherrydale. Since 1908, the Cherrydale Citizens' Association has planned activities and resolved neighborhood concerns. In the 1970s and 1980s, people often referred to the neighborhood as Mayberry, according to Springston, 63. In 1948, her parents bought the house where she lives with her husband and son. It dates to 1890, Springston said.<\/p><p>In the neighborhood, 49 properties sold in the past year, according to Billy Buck, an associate broker at Buck & Associates. The lowest priced was a one-bedroom, one-bath condominium for $200,000; the highest priced was a five-bedroom, five-bath farmhouse at $1.63 million. Twelve properties are on the market now, ranging from a one-bedroom, two-bath condo for $274,900 to a new five-bedroom, five-bath Craftsman house at $1.799 million.<\/p><p>Welcome wagon: The five-points intersection \u2014 Lee Highway, Old Dominion Drive, Quincy Street, Military Road and Quebec Street \u2014 is dotted with at least two car dealerships and other commercial establishments while nearby is a Safeway and the Cherrydale Hardware, which opened in 1938.<\/p><p>The Cherrydale Volunteer Fire House, built in 1919, is home to such events as the annual spaghetti dinner, concerts and for 90 years each December there is a visit from Santa Claus for children under 12. Other community events are the annual Fourth of July party and picnic at 21st and Stafford streets. A neighborhood with its own \"welcome wagon,\" Cherrydale has approximately 1,400 households and three parks as well as the Martha Custis Trail for biking, running and walking.<\/p><p>Schools: Glebe Elementary, Taylor Elementary, Swanson Middle, Kenmore Middle and Washington-Lee High.<\/p><p>Transit: The neighborhood is close to the Virginia Square or Ballston Metro stops on the Orange and Silver lines. Metro and Arlington Transit buses connect at Ballston and Virginia Square. Capital Bikeshare also is available.<\/p><p>Crime: From July 2014 through June 2015, according to Arlington County police, one robbery and two burglaries were reported in the area.<\/p><p>Harriet Edleson is a freelance writer.","408":"The White House tried Sunday to win support for President Obama's forthcoming budget, arguing the plan is a balanced approach to economic prosperity and warning Republicans about stonewalling negotiations and pushing a \"rejected\" Romney plan.<\/p><p>\"Right now, the approach of many Republicans, particularly the leadership in the House, is my way or the highway,\" senior White House adviser Dan Pfeiffer told \"Fox News Sunday.\" \"Their view is the only acceptable plan is to try to \u2026 essentially enact the Romney economic plan.

It's a sci-fi showpiece. It's an ultralight carbon-fiber production car. It's a triumph of parts-bin engineering. It's a take-no-prisoners canyon racer. It's a winged chariot of the Malibu \u00fcber-chic. It's a $136,625 (destination included!) commuter car for Silicon Valley moguls.<\/p><p>The hardware, at least, is straightforward. The central passenger shell is a stiff, lightweight carbon-fiber structure. It is bolted to an aluminum skeleton that holds the 7.1-kilowatt-hour lithium-ion battery pack in its spine.<\/p><p>An electric drive section similar to the one in the BMW i3 people pod is bolted to the front, its 131 horsepower electric motor and 2-speed automatic transmission driving the front wheels. The rear power package is sourced from the new Mini; its 3-cylinder, twin-turbocharged 231-horsepower engine drives the rear wheels through a 6-speed automatic transmission.<\/p><p>The multilayered skin is molded thermoplastic that weighs half as much as steel. Other extreme weight-saving measures, including aluminum wiring and chemically hardened ultrathin glass, keep the weight to 3,267 pounds. The long, light doors swing up and forward. From the front, with doors open, the i8 looks as if it's signaling a touchdown.<\/p><p>The interior is compact yet comfortable, though those over 6-foot-2 may need more legroom, and the rear seats are designed for tiny, limber people.<\/p><p>Getting in is a challenge. The sill is wide, the seat is low, and there's a trick: sit sideways, slide butt in, retract legs. Getting out? Imagine climbing from a bathtub without using your hands.<\/p><p>Pick a personality with the driving-mode buttons. \"Comfort\" keeps the car in electric mode to 37 m.p.h., or until you mash the right-side pedal. The eDrive button keeps things electric to 75 m.p.h. or until the battery fades.<\/p><p>Travel range is about 20 miles in E.V. mode, and recharging takes 1.5 hours at 240 volts or four hours at 120. The Eco-Pro button increases electric efficiency 20 percent by softening the motor response and optimizing climate-control settings. I observed gasoline-powered mileage figures from 27 m.p.g. (impatient cornering) to 37 m.p.g. (safe-and-sane commuting).<\/p><p>In the city, the i8 feels silent, solid and intuitive \u2014 the excitement happens outside, as gawkers track its progress.<\/p><p>On Los Angeles's well-used freeways, the Comfort setting leaves some comfort to be desired. Even with the variable dampers at full soft, the i8 bobs its nose like Muhammad Ali in the first rounds. High-performance tires come standard in the United States; European versions get narrower wheels and taller tires for lower drag and a smoother ride.<\/p><p>In Sport mode, the suspension and steering stiffen and the gas engine roars, pops on upshifts and matches revs downshifting into corners. It sounds great, and it should: much of what you hear is a prerecorded soundtrack piped through the sound system.<\/p><p>The i8 feels strong at full power, but the head-snapping response expected from a partly electric powertrain is absent. The i8 takes time to gather itself, with an atavistic vestige of turbo lag.<\/p><p>On the intestinal twists of Mulholland Highway the i8 can be driven with brutal abandon. The brakes are strong, the chassis is as stiff as a bank vault, and there's enough power to reach the next corner presently. BMW claims a 0-to-60 time of 4.2 seconds, and top speed is 155 m.p.h.<\/p><p>The front tires push when going hard into corners, but everything sticks coming out. Even with the stability control off, the i8 resists spinning its tires \u2014 the software ghost is still there, lurking in the machine.<\/p><p>The i8 is complicated and imperfect. A car that will be used for emissions-free commuting should allow people to get in and get out. It rides harshly. The exterior design is too clever \u2014 the layered rear deck whispers \"Your trunk is open.\"<\/p><p>Still, if the i8 represents the future of sports cars, things are looking bright.<\/p><p>A version of this review appears in print on May 11, 2014, on page AU4 of the New York edition with the headline: The Future Will See You Now.

We both lost. It's just a tragedy.\"<\/p><p>During the trial, Pratcher's own attorney admitted that the young man fired the four rifle shots that killed Kelly on Aug. 12, 2004 -- two days before the football player was scheduled to move to the University of Oregon on a sports scholarship.<\/p><p>But defense attorney Jonathan Laba argued that Pratcher killed Kelly in a case of mistaken identity. He said that the defendant feared for his life in an unrelated dispute and accidentally shot Kelly as the football player was waiting in a car to give his stepbrother, Brandon Young, a ride home from his girlfriend's house in Richmond's Iron Triangle District.<\/p><p>Laba argued that Pratcher should be convicted of manslaughter because the death was \"a tragic mistake.\"<\/p><p>But prosecutor David Brown told jurors Kelly's death amounted to \"cold-blooded murder,\" because Pratcher was determined to kill someone that night. Brown argued that Pratcher had the opportunity to notice that Kelly was in the car before grabbing the rifle, advancing on the Oldsmobile and opening fire.<\/p><p>\"It's totally unfair for them to say it was premeditated,\" said Pratcher's father, Larry Sr. \"Terrance just came right up; it's impossible for it to be premeditated. It's totally unfair -- my son is not guilty of first degree murder.\"<\/p><p>Pratcher was 15 years old when Kelly was killed and was tried as an adult in Contra Costa County Superior Court. He faces and faces a maximum sentence of 25 years to life.<\/p><p>Kelly died two days before he was to leave for the University of Oregon, where he had a football scholarship and was expected top play safety. His death stunned his hometown of Richmond as well as students, former players and fans at De La Salle in Concord.<\/p><p>Kelly had been named the most valuable player the previous season at De La Salle, where he played linebacker and running back on a team that didn't lose a game in his four years there.<\/p><p>Police arrested Pratcher, whose older brother, Larry Jr., had played youth basketball with Kelly, five days after the killing.

The president's push is part of a larger American effort to further isolate and increase pressure on Iran after accusing it of a plot to assassinate Saudi Arabia's ambassador to the United States.<\/p><p>If the United Nations' watchdog group agrees to publicize the evidence, including new data from recent months, it would almost certainly revive a debate that has been dormant during the Arab Spring about how aggressively the United States and its allies, including Israel, should move to halt Iran's suspected weapons program.<\/p><p>Over the longer term, several senior Obama administration officials said in interviews, they are mulling a ban on financial transactions with Iran's central bank \u2014 a move that has been opposed by China and other Asian nations. Also being considered is an expansion of the ban on the purchase of petroleum products sold by companies controlled by the country's elite military force, the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps.<\/p><p>The Revolutionary Guards are also believed to oversee the military side of the nuclear program, and they are the parent of the Quds Force, which Washington has accused of directing the assassination plot.<\/p><p>The proposed sanctions come as administration officials confront skepticism around the world about their allegations that Iran was behind the plot and limited options about what they can do \u2014 as well as growing pressure from Republicans and some Democrats in Congress to take tougher action against Iran, with the central bank and the oil industry high on lawmakers' lists.<\/p><p>All of the proposed sanctions carry with them considerable political and economic risks. Yukiya Amano, the cautious director general of the United Nations group, the International Atomic Energy Agency, talked publicly in September about publishing some of the most delicate data suggesting Iran worked on nuclear triggers and warheads. But officials who have spoken with him say he is concerned that his inspectors could be ejected from Iran, shutting the best, though narrow, window into its nuclear activities.<\/p><p>Similarly, China and Russia, among other major Iranian trading partners, have resisted further oil and financial sanctions, saying the goal of isolating Iran is a poor strategy. Even inside the Obama administration, some officials say they fear any crackdown on Iranian oil exports could drive up oil prices when the United States and European economies are weak. As one senior official put it, \"You don't want to tip the U.S. into a downturn just to punish the Iranians.\"<\/p><p>Senior administration officials, who would not speak publicly about internal negotiations over the sanctions, say no recommendation on acting against the central bank has gone to Mr. Obama, who vowed last week to make sure Iran would face the \"toughest sanctions\" for what he said was its role in the sensational scheme to hire a Mexican drug cartel to kill the Saudi envoy.<\/p><p>The decision to press the International Atomic Energy Agency was brewing even before the plot against the Saudi ambassador was discovered, but that discovery prompted the White House to pursue a full-court, public press of the agency to release the sensitive intelligence.<\/p><p>Officials familiar with the evidence say it creates extraordinarily uncomfortable questions for the Iranians to answer, but does not definitively point to the construction of a weapon. Instead, it details work on individual technologies essential for designing and detonating a nuclear device, including how to turn uranium into bomb fuel, how to cast conventional explosives in a shape that can set off a nuclear blast, and how to make detonators, generate neutrons to spur a chain reaction, measure detonation waves and make nose cones for missiles.<\/p><p>Tommy Vietor, the spokesman for the National Security Council, said Saturday that \"the United States believes that a comprehensive assessment would be invaluable for the international community in its consideration of Iran's nuclear program and what to do about it.\" Iran has declared that all of the documents suggesting work on how to create a weapon that could fit atop an Iranian missile are \"fabrications\" intended to justify an attack. The country has been the target of covert attacks, including the assassinations of some nuclear scientists and a computer worm that disabled some of Iran's nuclear centrifuges.<\/p><p>The Obama administration, since coming to office, has never publicly presented detailed evidence to back up its claim that Iran is driving toward a weapon or creating the technology to assemble one quickly, should it need it. But it has discussed the evidence widely with allies.<\/p><p>In part the administration has hesitated to discuss the evidence because, after the failure to find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq in 2003, any American evidence is considered suspect. Widespread questions about the plot against the Saudis last week underscored how deep those suspicions run.<\/p><p>But Iran is a different kind of case. Inspectors visit regularly, measuring Iran's output of uranium, including recent production of the material, enriched to 20 percent purity, that takes it far closer to the kind of fuel needed for a weapon. Iran said recently that it would produce more of the 20 percent enriched material than it needs for a small medical research reactor, which prompted new concerns that it is building a stockpile that could be converted to weapons use.","419":"MADRID (AP) \u2013 Spain's grinding economic misery will get worse this year despite the country's request for a European financial lifeline of up to $125 billion to save its banks, Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said Sunday.<\/p><p>A day after the country conceded it needed outside help following months of denying it would seek assistance, Rajoy said more Spaniards will lose their jobs in a country where one out of every four are already unemployed.<\/p><p>\"This year is going to be a bad one,\" Rajoy said Sunday in his first comments about the rescue since it was announced the previous evening by his economy minister.<\/p><p>The conservative prime minister added that the economy, stuck in its second recession in three years, will still contract the previously predicted 1.7 percent even with the help. Small businesses and families starving for credit will eventually get relief as the funding props up banks and they increase lending, but Rajoy didn't offer guidance on when.<\/p><p>Spain on Saturday became the fourth \u2014 and largest \u2014 of the 17 countries that use Europe's common currency to request a bailout \u2014 a big blow to a nation that a few years ago took pride as the continent's economic superstar only to see it become the hot spot in the eurozone debt crisis. Its economy is the eurozone's fourth largest after Germany, France and Italy.<\/p><p>Across the country, Spaniards reacted with a mixture of anger and relief to the news. The amount of the rescue fund, if all is tapped, amounts to \u20ac21,000 of new debt for each person in the nation of 47 million where the average annual salary for those with work is about the same amount and the unemployment rate for those under age 25 is 52 percent.<\/p><p>The country is already reeling from deep austerity cuts Rajoy has imposed over the last six months that have raised taxes, made it easier to hire and fire workers, and cut deep into cherished government programs including education and national health care.<\/p><p>\"It's obviously a shame,\" said civil servant Luisa Saraguren, 44, as she strolled on a sunny Sunday morning with her young daughter. \"But this bailout was fully predictable, and the consequences of this help are going to be a lot bigger compared to the cuts we've been living with already.\"<\/p><p>Rajoy took pains to avoid the word bailout Sunday, saying Spain's rescue package is a line of credit that its most troubled banks will be able to tap. The assistance will not come with the outside control over government macroeconomic policy like that imposed Greece, Ireland and Portugal when their public finances were bailed out.<\/p><p>He said interest rates on the loans will be considerably lower than the rate near 7 percent that Spain has been forced to pay recently on the international debt markets, a level that forced the other countries to seek bailouts.<\/p><p>Spain will regain the economic credibility it has lost by shoring up its banks, which will result in credit being restored so businesses and individuals shut off from loans can start borrowing and the economy will grow again, Rajoy insisted, again without saying when.<\/p><p>Europe's widening recession and financial crisis has hurt companies and investors around the world. Providing a financial lifeline to Spanish banks is likely to relieve anxiety on the Spanish economy \u2014 which is five times larger than Greece's \u2014 and on markets concerned about the country's ability to pay its way.<\/p><p>Spain's financial problems are not due to Greek-style government over-spending. The country's banks particularly its savings banks or \"cajas,\" got caught up in the collapse of a real estate bubble in 2008 that got worse over the past four years. However, as Spain's leaders have struggled for a solution to their banking crisis, the country's borrowing costs have soared close to the level that forced the governments of Greece, Portugal and Ireland to seek rescues.<\/p><p>Some of Spain's banks are struggling with by toxic real estate loans and assets amid fears the problem will get worse as more jobless people can't pay their mortgages. The Bank of Spain says the toxic loans and assets total around \u20ac180 billion. Nationalized lender Bankia SA, which has requested \u20ac19 billion in aid, has \u20ac32 billion in toxic assets. Around four other banks serving the domestic market are considered prime candidates for bailouts.<\/p><p>\"I could never get my mind round the scale of consumption in Spain over the past 20 years, having known it in the 1960s when it was still extremely poor,\" said Paul Preston, a history professor and expert on Spain with the London School of Economics. \"Lots of people enjoyed the consumer boom, but not everybody. Now everybody's having to pay for it.\"<\/p><p>Rajoy blamed Spain's woes on the previous Socialist administration of Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero without mentioning him or his government by name. Zapatero was ousted by Rajoy in a landslide last November by voters outraged over the Socialist handling of the economy.<\/p><p>\"Last year Spain's public administration spent \u20ac90 billion more than it took in, this can't be maintained, we can't live like that,\" Rajoy said.<\/p><p>But Socialist Party leader Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba said Rajoy should acknowledge that Spain is now in bailout territory.<\/p><p>\"The government is trying to make us believe that we've won the lottery, that the Three Kings of Orient have arrived, and that isn't so,\" Rubalcaba said.<\/p><p>After his press conference, Rajoy defended his decision to jet off an hour later to Poland to see Spain's famed national football team take on Italy in the Euro 2012 competition. He said he would be on the ground in Gdansk only for the game before flying back to Madrid Sunday night.<\/p><p>\"I'll be there two and a half hours and then I'll leave,\" Rajoy said. \"I think the national team deserves it.\"","420":"\"We don't want people coming back or visiting,\" Nugent said.

The downtown and the historic fort buildings are unscathed, she said.<\/p><p>The blaze, known as the Rock House fire, is currently the largest fire burning in the United States and is just one of 10 fires burning more than 312,000 acres in Texas.<\/p><p>Another 34 homes have burned in a fire in Midland County that has consumed over 16,500 acres and that the state agency on Sunday described as \"very active\" and not at all contained, officials said.<\/p><p>A Red Cross shelter has been set up at Midland College for those displaced or otherwise affected by this wildfire.<\/p><p>\"(Firefighters) can't outrun it,\" said Alan Craft, a spokesman for the state's Lone Star Incident Management Team.<\/p><p>Another large fire near Swenson has scorched some 103,000 acres in three counties, according to the state Forest Service. Spokeswoman April Saginor said officials believe the Swenson fire has been that large for a couple of days, but were not able to remap it until Monday.<\/p><p>As of Sunday night, the blaze across parts of Stonewall, Knox and King counties was totally uncontained despite the use of air resources, bulldozers, fire engines and other tools and personnel, a statement from the Forest Service said.<\/p><p>Official say this fire was caused by a man cutting a pipe.","421":"12\/28\/2015 AT 04:50 PM EST<\/p><p>Like a lot of professional funny people, Beth Stelling is used to getting candid about her life offstage.

Scared of what people will think, scared it makes me look weak or unprofessional,\" she writes.<\/p><p>\"When friends or comics ask why we broke up, it's not easy or comfortable to reply; it doesn't seem like the appropriate thing to say at a stand-up show, a party or a wedding. It's embarrassing. I feel stupid. After being verbally, physically abused and raped, I dated him for two more months. It's not simple.\"<\/p><p>Ultimately, Stelling couldn't exclude such a significant piece of her story from her onstage persona, even if it meant risking ridicule from the close-knit comedy community.<\/p><p>\"After I broke up with him, he said, 'You're very open and honest in your stand-up, and I just ask that you consider me when you talk about your ex because everyone knows who you're talking about.' And I abided. I wrote vague jokes because we both live in L.A., and I didn't want to hurt him, start a war, press charges, be interrogated or harassed by him or his friends and family. I wanted to move on and forget because I didn't understand,\" Stelling shares.<\/p><p>\"I don't want revenge or to hurt him now, but it's unhealthy to keep this inside because my stand-up is pulled directly from my life. It's how I make my living. My personal is my professional. That is how I've always been; I make dark, funny. So now I'm allowing this to be part of my story.\"<\/p><p>Stelling says she's already started joking about the relationship and asked her followers to \"have the courage to listen and accept.\"<\/p><p>So far, the funny lady has been getting a positive response to her openness at the mic.<\/p><p>\"Already since talking about this onstage, many women have come to me after shows asking me to keep doing it,\" she says on Instagram. \"Men have shown their solidarity.\"","422":"Now that Newt Gingrich has vaulted into the lead in the Republican presidential stakes, he's going to be seeing a lot more of this:<\/p><p>Calling it the \"dumbest thing\" he has done in recent years isn't enough. This is not going away.<\/p><p>But, Newt can turn his pas-de-deux on the loveseat with Nancy into an opportunity to promote a consistent and electable political message.<\/p><p>Because he will be asked about this at every turn, Newt will have the air time and the opportunity to tell the truth on climate change\u2014based upon real science\u2014and to interface it with a limited-government philosophy. The two are easy to do.<\/p><p>Start with the obvious. Instead of waffling on the subject, he could just point out that earth's surface temperature is about 1\u00b0C warmer than it was a century ago. There were two periods of warming, the first from about 1910 through 1945, and the second from the mid-1970s to the late-1990s. They were both roughly the same magnitude. Because the first one was long before we put the majority of fossil carbon into the atmosphere, Newt can say\u2014with scientific authority\u2014that the magnitude of 'natural' climate change is likely to be at least as large as what humans have done.<\/p><p>Then Newt should proceed to the future. It's not the heat, it's the sensitivity. How much it will warm in the future is a function of how sensitive the atmosphere is to doubling atmospheric carbon dioxide. There are a number of independent arguments now coming together showing that this value may have been overestimated. The reference for the most recent is a November issue of Science.<\/p><p>Next, a little refreshing honesty: in 2009, the House of Representatives passed a cap-and-trade bill (which the Senate did not) commanding that the average american\u201438 years from now\u2014be allowed the carbon dioxide emissions of the average citizen in 1867. Prior to its passage, Newt was undeniably for such a system. Newt could call that that the \"second dumbest thing\" he has done and be finished with it.<\/p><p>After setting the record straight, how about interjecting his own political philosophy? When asked what to do about global warming, he should give the honest answer: if the atmosphere indeed is not as sensitive to carbon dioxide changes as previously thought, the correct response is nothing.<\/p><p>That's because \"nothing\" really means something. Newt should channel his historian. When markets are free, capital supports innovation more efficiently than when they aren't. Think about the remarkable changes in energy and technology in the last 100 years. Isn't it rather obvious that the same will occur in the next century, if only we don't hinder capital development? Newt might even use the catchy saw (first sloganed by Northern Illinois Gas in 1972) the future belongs to the efficient, and that there are impressive market forces that advantage those who produce things efficiently or produce efficient things.<\/p><p>When the doomsayers say Newt is believing in a Deus ex machine to dramatically cut carbon dioxide emissions, he might point out that those were the same folks who, only a very few years ago, told us we were running out of natural gas. Innovation and capital revolutionized drilling and fracturing shale, and we now know we have literally hundreds of years of it under our feet. There are a lot more voters and delegates around the country who will benefit from the shale revolution than there are in ethanol-addicted Iowa.","423":"Jacksonville, Ark., police arrested reality TV stars Joshua Rendon and Ebony Jackson-Rendon this week after police found their filthy home contained drug paraphernalia and synthetic marijuana.

Beginning with its shot of a Pontiac GTO pulling doughnuts in a high school parking lot to Aerosmith's \"Sweet Emotion,\" \"Dazed\" is such a humane approximation of what it was like to come of age in the mid-1970s that one wishes it would never end. On the evidence of \"Boyhood\" and the \"Before Sunrise\" trilogy, though, Linklater doesn't want any of his movies to end. Thus \"Everybody Wants Some!!\"<\/p><p>Which at first is different, sometimes jarringly so, before wading into the open-armed embrace of experience that marks this filmmaker's finest work. The tipoffs are those double exclamation points and an onscreen title font that recalls a Skinemax late-night movie circa 1981. What if you took one of that era's hormone-drenched stu-coms and put real people in it?<\/p><p>The year is 1980, actually, and Jake (Blake Jenner from \"Glee\") is arriving for his freshman year at (the fictional) Southeastern Texas State University. A high school pitching star and rangy college prospect, he's assigned an off-campus baseball dorm with the other players. It's a ready-made animal house, with rules laid down by a briefly seen coach (Jonathan Breck) that are immediately ignored. Occasionally we'll get an onscreen reminder of how many dwindling days and hours remain before classes begin. These, too, are ignored.<\/p><p>Instead, Linklater parks his cameras to observe, with indulgence and much good humor, the bonding rituals of young men who only think they have it figured out. Jake's housemates fall into general categories that re-sort themselves into individual personalities: The motor-mouthed ladies' man Finnegan (Glen Powell), the Zen surfer-stoner Willoughby (Wyatt Russell), uber-competitive McReynolds (Tyler Hoechlin), country rube Billy (Will Brittain), smartass Nesbit (Austin Amelio), na\u00efve Brumley (Tanner Kalina). And so on.<\/p><p>A few stand slightly outside the pack: the over-confident psycho-nerd pitcher Jay Niles (Juston Street, freakily funny) and the laconic second base star Dale Douglas (J. Quinton Johnson), whose blackness is rarely commented on. Where are the women? There to be chased and partied with and seduced. \"This is college, Jake,\" the hero is told early on. \"The girls can be as big sluts as the guys.\"<\/p><p>Oh, dear. Is \"Everybody Wants Some!!\" what happens when you people an entire Richard Linklater movie with Matthew McConaughey's horndog Wooderson from \"Dazed and Confused\"? Yes and no, or, rather, yes, but only at first. As the boys sprawl through the last days of summer, the swagger that borders on smug begins to mellow and melt away. Searching for good times and girls, they hop from a disco one night to a country and western bar the next to a punk mosh pit to an art-student costume party, minds open, adapting, ever-changing. After a while, the hero starts having a smallish identity crisis, confessing that \"it sort of begs the question of who we are.\"<\/p><p>Well, yes. This is college, Jake. Even a high school sports star can be anyone he wants.<\/p><p>The movie eventually spins him off from the crowd into the arms of Beverly (Zoey Deutch), a tartly ardent stage arts freshman with Joni Mitchell posters on her wall. She's unpretentious for a theater brat, he's smart and soulful for a jock, and the two stand dazzled in the Venn diagram overlap of their attraction. These scenes try a little too hard to be charming but they are anyway, and if Deutch has the freckles and immediacy of a classic Brat Pack heroine, it may be because her mother is Lea Thompson of \"Back to the Future\" and \"Some Kind of Wonderful\" and her father is Howard Deutch, who directed the latter.<\/p><p>More second-generation pleasures: Wyatt Russell, who plays the woolly baseball mystic Willoughby, is the son of Kurt Russell and Goldie Hawn, and he has a high old time \u2014 emphasis on high \u2014 explaining to his teammates why \"Fearless,\" from the 1971 album \"Meddle,\" is the best track that Pink Floyd ever recorded. Because he is correct, I am awarding \"Everybody Wants Some!!\" an extra half-star.<\/p><p>Linklater was a high school baseball player who went to Sam Houston State on a scholarship, and the movie is steeped in the lazy, rivalrous minutiae of college ball. Willoughby gets off a moment of bliss when he muses on the pleasures of pitching \u2014 \"It's lovely out there on the bump,\" he says \u2014 and we learn that it's the .230 hitters who are always the most superstitious. Also that it's possible to slice a pitched baseball in half with an ax. At one point, one of the characters gazes with incredulity at a crowd of fellow students and says, \"I know what we're doing here. We're playing baseball. What are they doing here?\"<\/p><p>\"Everybody Wants Some!!\" is a nice long soak in the Proustian detritus of its era. Beverly drives a Gremlin, Jake knows the secret of winning at \"Space Invaders,\" and people can still confidently begin sentences with the words, \"It's like Carl Sagan says. . .\" What \"Sweet Emotion\" was to \"Dazed and Confused,\" so the Knack's \"My Sharona\" is to this movie, and the soundtrack rolls forward from there: glorious junk from the days when Eddie Rabbitt, Eddie Money, Sniff 'n' the Tears, and the BusBoys meant something.<\/p><p>All that's missing is a plot. But Linklater doesn't do plot; he does life. Says Powell's garrulous Finnegan, summing up the art of both this movie and this moviemaker, \"I don't think at all. I just talk a lot. It's jazz improv. You're invited.\" And so are we.<\/p><p>Written and directed by Richard Linklater. Starring Blake Jenner, Zoey Deutch, Glen Powell, Wyatt Russell, Tyler Hoechlin, Juston Street.

The company currently supplies their weapons to 17,800 of the United States' roughly 18,000 law enforcement agencies.<\/p><p>The brand name Taser has become as synonymous with these devices as Kleenex or Xerox have to photocopies and tissues \u2013 a quirk of language known as a \"proprietary eponym\". The word has even become a verb, as people commonly speak of being \"Tased\" or \"Tasered\".<\/p><p>The word Taser, though, didn't start with the company: it's actually a loose acronym of the book Tom Swift and His Electric Rifle. Jack Cover, the inventor of the modern ECD, named his prototype after the YA sci-fi novel he loved, and the very idea for a less-lethal electric gun was largely inspired by the fictional one described in the book.<\/p><p>And while this quirky history is known among some in law enforcement and engineering circles, the innocence with which it's told \u2013 a curious inventor culling inspiration from the literature of his youth \u2013 belies a more sinister truth: the book itself is boldly racist.<\/p><p>Tom Swift and His Electric Rifle, published in New York in 1911 under the pen name Victor Appleton, is typical of the literature of its time: an imperialist adventure tale set against the backdrop of a wild and dark African continent. In it, the protagonist, Tom Swift, develops an electric rifle \u2013 a totally novel idea in 1911 \u2013 and decides to test it in Africa in the hunt for ivory.<\/p><p>Africa, in the context of the book, exists only as a frontier of underexploited resources ripe for the wealth accumulation of white men daring enough to attempt. \"Elephant shooting in Africa! My! With my new electric rifle ... what a fellow couldn't do in the dark continent!\"<\/p><p>\"With the price of ivory soaring,\" says Swift's veteran hunting companion, \"there's a chance for us all to get a lot of money.\"<\/p><p>While this unabashed entrepreneurial imperialism tends to read as a relic of a bygone age, today disproportionately white police departments in places like Ferguson, Missouri, often function similarly as the adventurers sent to do the dangerous work of this kind of wealth generation. Like in the book, black communities are often seen not as dynamic places where people live lives, but as sites for plunder.<\/p><p>Take, for example, the Department of Justice's March report on the prevalence of predatory, revenue-based policing in St Louis County: entire municipalities there, as elsewhere in the US, float their operating budgets and justify their own existence on the racially biased extraction of statutory fees from primarily black residents. This scheme has only begun to decline because of the protests and organizing that defined Ferguson in the wake of Mike Brown's death.<\/p><p>In the book, as in America today, the black people are rendered as either passive, simple and childlike, or animalistic and capable of unimaginable violence. They are described in the book at various points as \"hideous in their savagery, wearing only the loin cloth, and with their kinky hair stuck full of sticks\", and as \"wild, savage and ferocious ... like little red apes\".<\/p><p>Swift and his travel companions quickly determine the blacks, scarcely human, need to be controlled, guided or killed as determined by the more \"civilized\" white outsiders.<\/p><p>Consider then how quickly the black people of Ferguson were rendered something less than fully human in the wake of Mike Brown's killing: an on-duty Ferguson police officer, a former NYPD commissioner and a popular actor all spared no time in invoking the discourse of \"animals\" in reference to black protesters. Near and far, incredulous commentators sought to cast the police as the sole defenders of black communities, and the only thing standing between those communities and self-destruction.<\/p><p>\"White police officers wouldn't be there if you weren't killing each other,\" former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani said on Meet the Press last November. Echoing Swift's rank paternalism, he later added: \"I probably saved more black lives as mayor of New York City than any mayor in the history of this city.\"<\/p><p>In the book, when Swift and his companions proudly use their advanced weapons \u2013 particularly the electric rifle \u2013 to dispatch with an incoming buffalo stampede, they too happily celebrate themselves as saviors.<\/p><p>\"Had it not been for the white men, the native village, which consisted of only frail huts, would have been completely wiped out by the animals,\" the novel reads.<\/p><p>Being named after a racist book doesn't make a company or device racist, any more than a person being named after a racist relative makes them so. A name is just that \u2013 and a Taser on its face is no more racist than the city or state of Washington are, simply for being named after our slaveholding first president.<\/p><p>But as recent campus activism in places such as Harvard and Princeton have demonstrated, there is real value in coming to terms with the bigotry embedded in the seemingly innocuous names and symbols of even our most ordinary, and aspirationally colorblind, institutions.<\/p><p>Being aware of the history of the word Taser should make us pause and consider that, every day, predominantly white police officers walk into predominantly black communities armed with weapons first imagined in a book in which \"civilized\" whites entered the black wilds for the purpose of plunder, only to cast themselves as the saviors of the natives. It isn't meaningless that today that sequence sometimes appears to persist in reverse.","427":"Disunion follows the Civil War as it unfolded.<\/p><p>The Lincoln administration may not have gone to war in 1861 to end slavery, but no one bothered to tell that to the slaves. Within six weeks of the firing on Fort Sumter, Gen. Benjamin Butler was forced to decide what to do with three slaves who escaped to Fortress Monroe on the north shore of Virginia's James River. Butler, certainly no abolitionist, nonetheless refused to return the three to their owner, labeling them \"contrabands of war.\"<\/p><p>The term, suitably ambiguous for an administration that as yet had no policy on how to handle the fugitives, found immediate acceptance. As one Union officer wrote, \"Never was a word so speedily adopted by so many people in so short a time.\" Within weeks hundreds of \"contrabands\" \u2014 men, women and children \u2014 flocked to Fortress Monroe and other Union Army positions. Unsure what might greet them, the escaped slaves were yet confident that life under federal control must surely represent an improvement.<\/p><p>It took the federal government more than a year to devise a policy in answer to this thirst for freedom. In August 1861, the First Confiscation Act stripped slaveholders of their claim of ownership, but it failed to clarify whether the slaves were themselves free. The following March Congress prohibited the military from sending escaped slaves back into slavery, and in July the Second Confiscation Act decreed that all slaves that took refuge in Union areas were \"captives of war\" and would be set free.<\/p><p>These legislative actions took on ever greater significance as Union forces moved deeper and deeper into Confederate territory. The growing number of contrabands reaching federal lines necessitated the establishment of dozens of impromptu contraband camps. A draft map compiled by the National Park Service illustrates how the network of these generally transitory camps mirrored the advance of the Union Army along the Mississippi, Tennessee and Cumberland River systems. Grant's Army of the Tennessee spent the summer of 1862 protecting supply lines in western Tennessee and northern Mississippi. Victories at the Battle of Iuka in September and the Battle of Corinth in early October solidified Union control of the area.<\/p><p>Lincoln's announcement of the preliminary Emancipation Proclamation on Sept. 22, 1862, produced an even greater flood of refugees. How best to use and care for these contrabands proved particularly vexing for military leaders under Grant's command. \"You have no idea of the consternation Old Abe's Proclamation is making,\" wrote Gen. Grenville Dodge to his brother in September. The contrabands \"will not even wait until 1st January. I do not know what we shall do with them.\"<\/p><p>Many of these fugitives arrived in an appalling condition. \"There were men, women, and children in every stage of disease or decrepitude often nearly naked, with flesh torn by the terrible experiences of their escape,\" wrote one observer. \"Often the slaves met prejudices against their color more bitter than any they had left behind.\"<\/p><p>On Nov. 11, 1862, Grant took the first step toward addressing the crisis: he named John Eaton, a former high school principal and chaplain of the 27th Ohio Infantry, as superintendent of contrabands and set him at work \"organizing them into suitable companies for working.\" A month later he went further. \"The negroes will be clothed, and in every way provided for, out of their earnings\" \u2014 about 12.5 cents for each pound of cotton picked \u2014 \"so far as practicable,\" he ordered. \"In no case will negroes be forced into the service of the Government, or be enticed away from their homes except when it becomes a military necessity.\"<\/p><p>Grant's policies lent the contraband camps an official status and began to define what a freedman could and could not do once within the Union lines. Personally, Grant appears to have had no particular sympathy for the refugees. He seems to have recognized that, in the words of one observer, \"The soldiers of our army were a good deal opposed to serving the Negro in any manner.\" Nevertheless, the Union commander unreservedly supported Eaton's work and in the process enabled the creation of one of the war's most successful contraband camps, located at Corinth, Miss.<\/p><p>Although formally organized under the direction of General Dodge in early December 1862 and placed under the command of James M. Alexander, chaplain of the 66th Illinois, the Corinth camp likely came into existence as early as September. Initially housed in army tents no longer considered serviceable for Union troops, the freedmen were soon set to work downing trees and clearing land on which to build cabins and lay out streets, which were named for Union generals. Eventually the freedmen also built a four-room school, a commissary, a hospital, a church and an office. The entire camp was divided into wards, complete with ward masters and a police force.<\/p><p>In late 1862 the American Missionary Association sent its first volunteers to Corinth to help care for, educate and minister to the freedmen. In a memoir written years after the war, one such missionary recalled her experience. \"When brought face to face with the slaves,\" she wrote, \"it was like the discovery of a new race.\" The men and women who came to Corinth generally shared a paternalistic optimism and viewed the freedmen as childlike in their enthusiasm for both education and salvation.<\/p><p>The freedmen's thirst for knowledge was undeniable. \"You will find them every hour of daylight, at their books,\" observed the Rev. Edward Pierce in March of 1863. \"We cannot enter a cabin, or tent, but that we see from one to three with books.\" Within no time Pierce and his wife had more than 150 students, and by the end of the summer, the addition of more missionaries enabled the school to accommodate between 300 and 400 children as well as 60 adults at a night school. In August, one of the teachers estimated that as many as 1,000 freedmen had learned to read in the Corinth camp.<\/p><p>Organized religion followed closely on the heels of formal education. Reverend Olds \"saw an earnestness in reference to the Christian life that I have seldom seen. And as I saw their deep earnestness & heard their hearty responses,\" he said, \"I was led to ask where can we find a more impressible people than these?\"<\/p><p>The population of the camp fluctuated between 1,500 and 6,000, as large groups undertook assignments for the Union Army or contracted to work on local plantations. In March 1863, for example, the camp was home to 658 men, 1,440 women and 1,559 children. Among the men were 36 blacksmiths, 48 carpenters, 180 teamsters and 200 cooks. The female ranks included 80 seamstresses, 150 laundresses and 600 cooks. Two-thirds of the men and three-quarters of the women were married, and seven in eight women had children. According to John Eaton's records, the camp had experienced 900 cases of illness, 189 deaths and 45 births.<\/p><p>Life at Corinth changed dramatically after a May 1863 visit by Adj. Gen. Lorenzo Thomas, who was intent on recruiting thousands of contrabands for his newly formed black regiments. With the organization of the 1st Alabama Infantry of African Descent, later renamed the 55th United States Colored Troops, the camp lost most of its able-bodied men.<\/p><p>Their departure to fight left only the women, the young, the old and the infirm to carry on Eaton's ambitious agricultural program, which rested on the cooperative farming of large tracts of abandoned and confiscated land. The program put 400 acres under cultivation, 300 for cotton and 100 for vegetables. Each cabin also had its own subsistence garden. By May 1863, the success of the agricultural program and the presence of a multitude of skilled artisans produced a clear monthly profit of $4,000 to $5,000 for the government, as well as an admirably independent community that Eaton hoped might serve as a model for other camps.<\/p><p>Unfortunately, the success of the Corinth camp proved short-lived. Plans for a winter campaign by Union forces in January 1864 provided a grim reminder that the fate of the freedmen was always secondary to the triumph of the Union cause. The order to relocate the camp's inhabitants 93 miles westward, to Memphis, \"fell like a bomb-shell among our contented people,\" lamented one missionary, \"but military orders are preemptory,\" and they \"must be obeyed.\" The freedmen left their \"well-organized village,\" gardens and farms to tdiv><\/p><p>The move from Corinth destroyed the spirit that had animated the freedmen's success. Some of the new refugees found work on confiscated plantations or in Memphis, but most lived in one of several camps surrounding the city.<\/p><p>\"The destruction of the Corinth camp,\" noted one historian, \"was one of the tragedies of the Civil War.\" Eaton's plan for large-scale cooperative farming fell victim to a bitter struggle between the War and Treasury departments over the leasing of plantations and was never implemented elsewhere. And no more than one or two other camps were able to replicate the strong civilian leadership, well-planned and policed living environment, and emphasis on education that made Corinth a success.<\/p><p>Had the government learned from the model fashioned in northern Mississippi between the fall of 1862 and early 1864, the newly freed slaves might well have enjoyed a far easier transition to life in postwar America.<\/p><p>Sources: Joseph E.

It's been nearly two decades since pictures of this sort were produced with any regularity by the studio system, and a lot longer since they were stateside successes. Many of the attempts in recent years have been, at best, mid-budget passion projects with circumscribed audiences (Stallone's own<\/p><p>which topped out at $42 million domestically) or post-modern winks (the French-language \"JCVD\" from 2008, a hostage movie in which Jean-Claude Van Damme plays a version of himself).

And this weekend, the movie showed that there's life in that category yet. That \"Scott Pilgrim vs. the World,\" the tongue-in-cheek, pop-culture-referential, decidedly 2010 creation -- the one for, of and by arch fanboys -- trailed well behind \"The Expendables\" only drove home the point more loudly.<\/p><p>On one hand, it's understandable that a movie of easy American heroism (OK, first-world Western heroism) would catch on. In fact, it's surprising it didn't happen sooner. Apple-pie-patriotism already is behind the success of a cable news network and supports large sections of the contemporary country music industry. Why not a film hit too?<\/p><p>But among all the factors to which one might point in explaining the success of \"The Expendables\" -- a cast harvested from so many demographics and eras; a moviegoer backlash to 3-D and CG effects -- it somehow doesn't feel that the demand for neat heroes and villains is one of them.<\/p><p>Norris and his ilk would submit that in our current period of ideological and geopolitical upheaval, in a time of blurry lines between enemies and friends in places such as Afghanistan and Iraq, that black-and-white heroes slake a patriotic thirst (and that, indeed, the movie-going world can support a lot more of them). But history argues the opposite: Those movies succeed when the culture at large is filled with clear-cut distinctions. On the other hand, when the zeitgeist is more cloudy, an entirely different kind of cinema prospers.<\/p><p>The post-WWII era and its mainly straightforward distinctions between good and evil, to take an example of the former, yielded a flowering subgenre of movies with morally uncomplicated gunslingers. And 30 years later, the ideological simplicity of the Cold War and its larger-than-life Evil Empire gave rise to the very action movies on which \"Expendables\" is modeled (not to mention the ultimate in us-versus-them confections, \"Rocky IV.\" Yes, there's a Stallone-ishness to all of this). There are plenty of reasons why these types of movies faded from view in the 1990s, but the fall of the Berlin Wall and the the Soviet Union certainly played a part.<\/p><p>The examples are just as abundant on the other side. The ambiguities of the Vietnam War and the counterculture in the late 1960s and early 1970s undoubtedly offered up the moral murkiness of<\/p><p>\"Midnight Cowboy\" and scores of others. In the post-9\/11 world, meanwhile, movies like<\/p><p>-- with its themes of a destruction-bent enemy that can't be bargained with, and the question of what constitutes an acceptable ethical compromise in fighting that enemy -- have captured our imagination. You can throw<\/p><p>in there too, to the degree the movie was a contemplation of Western interests in the Middle East.<\/p><p>Political eras are, of course, rarely just one thing or another, and the movies we want to see in a given period are hardly monolithic. But as tempting as it is to infer that the success of \"The Expendables\" shows a deeper cultural need, it may well be the wrong inference. When times are confusing, we want movies to reflect that confusion, and even to make sense of it. But we probably don't want to pretend that confusion doesn't exist.<\/p><p>Photo: A scene from \"The Expendables.\" Credit: Lionsgate<\/p><p>Stallone: I'm contemplating an \"Expendables\" sequel<\/p><p>Hollywood wonders if Schwarzenegger will be back","431":"Writer-director Richard Linklater has described his latest film, \"Everybody Wants Some!!,\" as a \"spiritual sequel\" to 1993's \"Dazed and Confused.\" That made my heart fibrillate a little, and maybe yours too. Beginning with its shot of a Pontiac GTO pulling doughnuts in a high school parking lot to Aerosmith's \"Sweet Emotion,\" \"Dazed\" is such a humane approximation of what it was like to come of age in the mid-1970s that one wishes it would never end. On the evidence of \"Boyhood\" and the \"Before Sunrise\" trilogy, though, Linklater doesn't want any of his movies to end. Thus \"Everybody Wants Some!!\"<\/p><p>Which at first is different, sometimes jarringly so, before wading into the open-armed embrace of experience that marks this filmmaker's finest work. The tipoffs are those double exclamation points and an onscreen title font that recalls a Skinemax late-night movie circa 1981. What if you took one of that era's hormone-drenched stu-coms and put real people in it?<\/p><p>The year is 1980, actually, and Jake (Blake Jenner from \"Glee\") is arriving for his freshman year at (the fictional) Southeastern Texas State University. A high school pitching star and rangy college prospect, he's assigned an off-campus baseball dorm with the other players. It's a ready-made animal house, with rules laid down by a briefly seen coach (Jonathan Breck) that are immediately ignored. Occasionally we'll get an onscreen reminder of how many dwindling days and hours remain before classes begin. These, too, are ignored.<\/p><p>Instead, Linklater parks his cameras to observe, with indulgence and much good humor, the bonding rituals of young men who only think they have it figured out. Jake's housemates fall into general categories that re-sort themselves into individual personalities: The motor-mouthed ladies' man Finnegan (Glen Powell), the Zen surfer-stoner Willoughby (Wyatt Russell), uber-competitive McReynolds (Tyler Hoechlin), country rube Billy (Will Brittain), smartass Nesbit (Austin Amelio), na\u00efve Brumley (Tanner Kalina). And so on.<\/p><p>A few stand slightly outside the pack: the over-confident psycho-nerd pitcher Jay Niles (Juston Street, freakily funny) and the laconic second base star Dale Douglas (J. Quinton Johnson), whose blackness is rarely commented on. Where are the women? There to be chased and partied with and seduced. \"This is college, Jake,\" the hero is told early on. \"The girls can be as big sluts as the guys.\"<\/p><p>Oh, dear. Is \"Everybody Wants Some!!\" what happens when you people an entire Richard Linklater movie with Matthew McConaughey's horndog Wooderson from \"Dazed and Confused\"? Yes and no, or, rather, yes, but only at first. As the boys sprawl through the last days of summer, the swagger that borders on smug begins to mellow and melt away. Searching for good times and girls, they hop from a disco one night to a country and western bar the next to a punk mosh pit to an art-student costume party, minds open, adapting, ever-changing. After a while, the hero starts having a smallish identity crisis, confessing that \"it sort of begs the question of who we are.\"<\/p><p>Well, yes. This is college, Jake. Even a high school sports star can be anyone he wants.<\/p><p>The movie eventually spins him off from the crowd into the arms of Beverly (Zoey Deutch), a tartly ardent stage arts freshman with Joni Mitchell posters on her wall. She's unpretentious for a theater brat, he's smart and soulful for a jock, and the two stand dazzled in the Venn diagram overlap of their attraction. These scenes try a little too hard to be charming but they are anyway, and if Deutch has the freckles and immediacy of a classic Brat Pack heroine, it may be because her mother is Lea Thompson of \"Back to the Future\" and \"Some Kind of Wonderful\" and her father is Howard Deutch, who directed the latter.<\/p><p>More second-generation pleasures: Wyatt Russell, who plays the woolly baseball mystic Willoughby, is the son of Kurt Russell and Goldie Hawn, and he has a high old time \u2014 emphasis on high \u2014 explaining to his teammates why \"Fearless,\" from the 1971 album \"Meddle,\" is the best track that Pink Floyd ever recorded. Because he is correct, I am awarding \"Everybody Wants Some!!\" an extra half-star.<\/p><p>Linklater was a high school baseball player who went to Sam Houston State on a scholarship, and the movie is steeped in the lazy, rivalrous minutiae of college ball. Willoughby gets off a moment of bliss when he muses on the pleasures of pitching \u2014 \"It's lovely out there on the bump,\" he says \u2014 and we learn that it's the .230 hitters who are always the most superstitious. Also that it's possible to slice a pitched baseball in half with an ax. At one point, one of the characters gazes with incredulity at a crowd of fellow students and says, \"I know what we're doing here. We're playing baseball. What are they doing here?\"<\/p><p>\"Everybody Wants Some!!\" is a nice long soak in the Proustian detritus of its era. Beverly drives a Gremlin, Jake knows the secret of winning at \"Space Invaders,\" and people can still confidently begin sentences with the words, \"It's like Carl Sagan says. . .\" What \"Sweet Emotion\" was to \"Dazed and Confused,\" so the Knack's \"My Sharona\" is to this movie, and the soundtrack rolls forward from there: glorious junk from the days when Eddie Rabbitt, Eddie Money, Sniff 'n' the Tears, and the BusBoys meant something.<\/p><p>All that's missing is a plot. But Linklater doesn't do plot; he does life. Says Powell's garrulous Finnegan, summing up the art of both this movie and this moviemaker, \"I don't think at all. I just talk a lot. It's jazz improv. You're invited.\" And so are we.<\/p><p>Written and directed by Richard Linklater. Starring Blake Jenner, Zoey Deutch, Glen Powell, Wyatt Russell, Tyler Hoechlin, Juston Street.

(Sarah Parnass\/The Washington Post)<\/p><p>The House Select Committee on Blumenthal, as some are now calling it, came to order at 10 a.m. Lawmakers didn't finish questioning Hillary Clinton until 11 hours later \u2014 just after the Democratic presidential candidate succumbed to a coughing fit.<\/p><p>In that period of time, the name of Sidney Blumenthal was invoked more than 75 times, and scores of questions were asked about the longtime Clinton friend. By lunchtime, Blumenthal had been invoked 49 times \u2014 exactly the number of mentions of J. Christopher Stevens, the ambassador to Libya whose death in Benghazi is the supposed subject of the congressional probe. The other three Americans slain in Benghazi \u2014 Sean Smith, Glen Doherty, Tyrone Woods \u2014 got seven or eight mentions apiece, then-CIA director David Petraeus and former defense secretary Robert Gates each got two, and then-Defense Secretary Leon Panetta had none.<\/p><p>Dana Milbank writes about political theater in the nation's capital. He joined the Post as a political reporter in 2000.<\/p><p>Chairman Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.), reading from Blumenthal's e-mails to Clinton as if he were the teacher who had intercepted a note passed between two high school kids, said Blumenthal referred to Gates as \"a mean, vicious little\"\u2014 Gowdy paused. \"I'm not going to say the word, but he did.\"<\/p><p>He also quoted Blumenthal referring to then- national security adviser Thomas E. Donilon's \"babbling rhetoric,\" and he said Blumenthal had referred to \"Obama\" (he \"left the 'president' part out\") and \"his political cronies in the White House and Chicago.\"<\/p><p>Clinton refused to get riled. \"I don't know what this line of questioning does to help us get to the bottom of deaths of four Americans,\" she said.<\/p><p>But Gowdy knew. A couple of minutes later, he announced: \"I'll tell you what: If you think you've heard about Sidney Blumenthal so far, wait until the next round.\"<\/p><p>He and his colleagues made good on that statement, posing questions on a Blumenthal visit to Clinton's home, about his work for the Clinton Foundation, his business interests, his attempt to get a job at the State Department and his communication with the former secretary of state over matters as mundane as her new iPad. They were particularly concerned with whether Blumenthal's advice to Clinton on Libya was \"unsolicited.\"<\/p><p>The Blumenthal focus shows that, after 17 months of probing Clinton, the Benghazi committee hasn't come up with much. Blumenthal has been a Clinton hatchet man for years, and he has an unsavory reputation. The very mention of his name (he was prominent during the Monica Lewinsky scandal) lends a whiff of skulduggery to any situation.<\/p><p>But injecting Blumenthal as a central character in the Benghazi probe doesn't help Republicans demonstrate that Clinton did wrong. And the justification for invoking him \u2014 to demonstrate that Clinton had more contact with him than with Stevens \u2014 is a stretch. Whatever else one thinks of the former journalist \u2014 I've clashed with him over the years \u2014 he had nothing to do with what happened in Libya on Sept. 11 and 12, 2012.<\/p><p>Rep. Mike Pompeo (R-Kan.) acted as if he had found a video of Blumenthal attacking the compound himself. Pompeo, who had previously made the false allegation that Clinton got \"most of her intelligence\" on Libya from Blumenthal, asked whether Stevens had Clinton's personal e-mail, her cellphone number, fax or home address or visited her at home. \"Mr. Blumenthal had each of those and did each of those things,\" Pompeo concluded.<\/p><p>Rep. Peter J. Roskam (R-Ill.) thought he saw a smoking gun in an e-mail correspondence from August 2011 in which Blumenthal encouraged Clinton to \"make a public statement before the cameras\" when Libyan leader Moammar Gaddafi was deposed.<\/p><p>\"Two months before the end of the Gaddafi regime and you're already planning on how to make your statement dramatic to maximize political gain,\" Roskam scolded.<\/p><p>Relevance to the Benghazi attack? None.<\/p><p>Gowdy, for his part, found it damning that Clinton aides passed along some of Blumenthal's advice (which he got from a former intelligence official) to people including Stevens. \"It's relevant because our ambassador was asked to read and respond to Sidney Blumenthal's drivel,\" the chairman said, \"in some instances on the very same day he was asking for security.\"<\/p><p>Rep. Adam B. Schiff (Calif.), a Democrat, observed that for all the time the panel has spent on Blumenthal, you'd think \"that he was in Benghazi on the night, manning the barricades.\" During private testimony from Blumenthal, to which he was summoned by federal marshals, Republicans asked more than 160 questions about Blumenthal's associations with Bill and Hillary Clinton but fewer than 20 about the Benghazi attacks.<\/p><p>Schiff and Rep. Elijah E. Cummings (Md.), the ranking Democrat, proposed that Republicans, rather than selectively releasing Blumenthal's e-mails, come clean about their interest in him and make public the entire transcript of his testimony. Gowdy, after a shouting match with Cummings, refused.<\/p><p>Read more from Dana Milbank's archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.","435":"Some things are more important than football, and Leah Still is doing something that's much harder than anything that can be done on a football field.<\/p><p>Former Cincinnati Bengals defensive lineman Devon Still announced on Instagram that his daughter Leah is cancer-free.<\/p><p>Leah Still, 5, was diagnosed with cancer in June 2014 and given a 50-50 chance to live.<\/p><p>The Bengals kept Still on their practice squad after cutting him last year, according to SI.com, and he eventually made the active roster and appeared in 12 games.<\/p><p>Still again was cut in September and is currently a free agent, but he'll take Leah kicking cancer over signing with a team any day.<\/p><p>More from The Sports Daily:","436":"Though it may feel out of the way \u2014 far, far east on the Lower East Side \u2014 there's no missing American Realness once you get there.

Ms. P\u00e9trin appeared just as calmly immersed in her task of adorning the ground with origami squares. Three live snakes, delivered from offstage, soon joined in. Humans and reptiles slid over and around one another.<\/p><p>This was just the first of many tenuously related, increasingly chaotic episodes, including the arrival of two Chihuahuas (the snakes, not to worry, had exited) and a migration into the adjacent black-box theater for a ritualistic ringing of hand-held bells. A mysterious voice, accompanying a video projection, pronounced, \"This piece will not save us.\" Ms. Lacey, cradling a small, three-legged dog while bending and stretching her limbs, told a story about an artist and an institution (Realness, perhaps) trying to spice up their relationship like old lovers. What to do with all this information? I thought of dance as undomesticated wildlife, of the predators and prey involved in buying and selling performance.<\/p><p>Down one set of stairs and up another, in a tucked-away dance studio not often used for performances, the choreographer Heather Kravas, visiting from Seattle, offered the New York premiere of \"dead, disappears.\" Ms. Kravas was her own predator and protector in this stark, self-punishing solo, as she put herself through perilous paces inspired by the sculptor Richard Serra's \"Verb List,\" a series of actions that he associated with making his pieces.<\/p><p>What seemed at first like arbitrary acts of masochism \u2014 walking on tiptoe with a trash bag over her head while barking two-syllable phrases \u2014 deepened into a formidable exploration of language, the female body and the power play between them.

It's a sci-fi showpiece. It's an ultralight carbon-fiber production car. It's a triumph of parts-bin engineering. It's a take-no-prisoners canyon racer. It's a winged chariot of the Malibu \u00fcber-chic. It's a $136,625 (destination included!) commuter car for Silicon Valley moguls.<\/p><p>The hardware, at least, is straightforward. The central passenger shell is a stiff, lightweight carbon-fiber structure. It is bolted to an aluminum skeleton that holds the 7.1-kilowatt-hour lithium-ion battery pack in its spine.<\/p><p>An electric drive section similar to the one in the BMW i3 people pod is bolted to the front, its 131 horsepower electric motor and 2-speed automatic transmission driving the front wheels. The rear power package is sourced from the new Mini; its 3-cylinder, twin-turbocharged 231-horsepower engine drives the rear wheels through a 6-speed automatic transmission.<\/p><p>The multilayered skin is molded thermoplastic that weighs half as much as steel. Other extreme weight-saving measures, including aluminum wiring and chemically hardened ultrathin glass, keep the weight to 3,267 pounds. The long, light doors swing up and forward.

The president's push is part of a larger American effort to further isolate and increase pressure on Iran after accusing it of a plot to assassinate Saudi Arabia's ambassador to the United States.<\/p><p>If the United Nations' watchdog group agrees to publicize the evidence, including new data from recent months, it would almost certainly revive a debate that has been dormant during the Arab Spring about how aggressively the United States and its allies, including Israel, should move to halt Iran's suspected weapons program.<\/p><p>Over the longer term, several senior Obama administration officials said in interviews, they are mulling a ban on financial transactions with Iran's central bank \u2014 a move that has been opposed by China and other Asian nations. Also being considered is an expansion of the ban on the purchase of petroleum products sold by companies controlled by the country's elite military force, the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps.<\/p><p>The Revolutionary Guards are also believed to oversee the military side of the nuclear program, and they are the parent of the Quds Force, which Washington has accused of directing the assassination plot.<\/p><p>The proposed sanctions come as administration officials confront skepticism around the world about their allegations that Iran was behind the plot and limited options about what they can do \u2014 as well as growing pressure from Republicans and some Democrats in Congress to take tougher action against Iran, with the central bank and the oil industry high on lawmakers' lists.<\/p><p>All of the proposed sanctions carry with them considerable political and economic risks. Yukiya Amano, the cautious director general of the United Nations group, the International Atomic Energy Agency, talked publicly in September about publishing some of the most delicate data suggesting Iran worked on nuclear triggers and warheads. But officials who have spoken with him say he is concerned that his inspectors could be ejected from Iran, shutting the best, though narrow, window into its nuclear activities.<\/p><p>Similarly, China and Russia, among other major Iranian trading partners, have resisted further oil and financial sanctions, saying the goal of isolating Iran is a poor strategy. Even inside the Obama administration, some officials say they fear any crackdown on Iranian oil exports could drive up oil prices when the United States and European economies are weak. As one senior official put it, \"You don't want to tip the U.S. into a downturn just to punish the Iranians.\"<\/p><p>Senior administration officials, who would not speak publicly about internal negotiations over the sanctions, say no recommendation on acting against the central bank has gone to Mr. Obama, who vowed last week to make sure Iran would face the \"toughest sanctions\" for what he said was its role in the sensational scheme to hire a Mexican drug cartel to kill the Saudi envoy.<\/p><p>The decision to press the International Atomic Energy Agency was brewing even before the plot against the Saudi ambassador was discovered, but that discovery prompted the White House to pursue a full-court, public press of the agency to release the sensitive intelligence.<\/p><p>Officials familiar with the evidence say it creates extraordinarily uncomfortable questions for the Iranians to answer, but does not definitively point to the construction of a weapon. Instead, it details work on individual technologies essential for designing and detonating a nuclear device, including how to turn uranium into bomb fuel, how to cast conventional explosives in a shape that can set off a nuclear blast, and how to make detonators, generate neutrons to spur a chain reaction, measure detonation waves and make nose cones for missiles.<\/p><p>Tommy Vietor, the spokesman for the National Security Council, said Saturday that \"the United States believes that a comprehensive assessment would be invaluable for the international community in its consideration of Iran's nuclear program and what to do about it.\" Iran has declared that all of the documents suggesting work on how to create a weapon that could fit atop an Iranian missile are \"fabrications\" intended to justify an attack. The country has been the target of covert attacks, including the assassinations of some nuclear scientists and a computer worm that disabled some of Iran's nuclear centrifuges.<\/p><p>The Obama administration, since coming to office, has never publicly presented detailed evidence to back up its claim that Iran is driving toward a weapon or creating the technology to assemble one quickly, should it need it. But it has discussed the evidence widely with allies.<\/p><p>In part the administration has hesitated to discuss the evidence because, after the failure to find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq in 2003, any American evidence is considered suspect. Widespread questions about the plot against the Saudis last week underscored how deep those suspicions run.<\/p><p>But Iran is a different kind of case. Inspectors visit regularly, measuring Iran's output of uranium, including recent production of the material, enriched to 20 percent purity, that takes it far closer to the kind of fuel needed for a weapon. Iran said recently that it would produce more of the 20 percent enriched material than it needs for a small medical research reactor, which prompted new concerns that it is building a stockpile that could be converted to weapons use.","440":"MADRID (AP) \u2013 Spain's grinding economic misery will get worse this year despite the country's request for a European financial lifeline of up to $125 billion to save its banks, Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said Sunday.<\/p><p>A day after the country conceded it needed outside help following months of denying it would seek assistance, Rajoy said more Spaniards will lose their jobs in a country where one out of every four are already unemployed.<\/p><p>\"This year is going to be a bad one,\" Rajoy said Sunday in his first comments about the rescue since it was announced the previous evening by his economy minister.<\/p><p>The conservative prime minister added that the economy, stuck in its second recession in three years, will still contract the previously predicted 1.7 percent even with the help. Small businesses and families starving for credit will eventually get relief as the funding props up banks and they increase lending, but Rajoy didn't offer guidance on when.<\/p><p>Spain on Saturday became the fourth \u2014 and largest \u2014 of the 17 countries that use Europe's common currency to request a bailout \u2014 a big blow to a nation that a few years ago took pride as the continent's economic superstar only to see it become the hot spot in the eurozone debt crisis. Its economy is the eurozone's fourth largest after Germany, France and Italy.<\/p><p>Across the country, Spaniards reacted with a mixture of anger and relief to the news. The amount of the rescue fund, if all is tapped, amounts to \u20ac21,000 of new debt for each person in the nation of 47 million where the average annual salary for those with work is about the same amount and the unemployment rate for those under age 25 is 52 percent.<\/p><p>The country is already reeling from deep austerity cuts Rajoy has imposed over the last six months that have raised taxes, made it easier to hire and fire workers, and cut deep into cherished government programs including education and national health care.<\/p><p>\"It's obviously a shame,\" said civil servant Luisa Saraguren, 44, as she strolled on a sunny Sunday morning with her young daughter. \"But this bailout was fully predictable, and the consequences of this help are going to be a lot bigger compared to the cuts we've been living with already.\"<\/p><p>Rajoy took pains to avoid the word bailout Sunday, saying Spain's rescue package is a line of credit that its most troubled banks will be able to tap. The assistance will not come with the outside control over government macroeconomic policy like that imposed Greece, Ireland and Portugal when their public finances were bailed out.<\/p><p>He said interest rates on the loans will be considerably lower than the rate near 7 percent that Spain has been forced to pay recently on the international debt markets, a level that forced the other countries to seek bailouts.<\/p><p>Spain will regain the economic credibility it has lost by shoring up its banks, which will result in credit being restored so businesses and individuals shut off from loans can start borrowing and the economy will grow again, Rajoy insisted, again without saying when.<\/p><p>Europe's widening recession and financial crisis has hurt companies and investors around the world. Providing a financial lifeline to Spanish banks is likely to relieve anxiety on the Spanish economy \u2014 which is five times larger than Greece's \u2014 and on markets concerned about the country's ability to pay its way.<\/p><p>Spain's financial problems are not due to Greek-style government over-spending. The country's banks particularly its savings banks or \"cajas,\" got caught up in the collapse of a real estate bubble in 2008 that got worse over the past four years. However, as Spain's leaders have struggled for a solution to their banking crisis, the country's borrowing costs have soared close to the level that forced the governments of Greece, Portugal and Ireland to seek rescues.<\/p><p>Some of Spain's banks are struggling with by toxic real estate loans and assets amid fears the problem will get worse as more jobless people can't pay their mortgages. The Bank of Spain says the toxic loans and assets total around \u20ac180 billion. Nationalized lender Bankia SA, which has requested \u20ac19 billion in aid, has \u20ac32 billion in toxic assets. Around four other banks serving the domestic market are considered prime candidates for bailouts.<\/p><p>\"I could never get my mind round the scale of consumption in Spain over the past 20 years, having known it in the 1960s when it was still extremely poor,\" said Paul Preston, a history professor and expert on Spain with the London School of Economics. \"Lots of people enjoyed the consumer boom, but not everybody. Now everybody's having to pay for it.\"<\/p><p>Rajoy blamed Spain's woes on the previous Socialist administration of Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero without mentioning him or his government by name. Zapatero was ousted by Rajoy in a landslide last November by voters outraged over the Socialist handling of the economy.<\/p><p>\"Last year Spain's public administration spent \u20ac90 billion more than it took in, this can't be maintained, we can't live like that,\" Rajoy said.<\/p><p>But Socialist Party leader Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba said Rajoy should acknowledge that Spain is now in bailout territory.<\/p><p>\"The government is trying to make us believe that we've won the lottery, that the Three Kings of Orient have arrived, and that isn't so,\" Rubalcaba said.<\/p><p>After his press conference, Rajoy defended his decision to jet off an hour later to Poland to see Spain's famed national football team take on Italy in the Euro 2012 competition. He said he would be on the ground in Gdansk only for the game before flying back to Madrid Sunday night.<\/p><p>\"I'll be there two and a half hours and then I'll leave,\" Rajoy said. \"I think the national team deserves it.\"","441":"Though it may feel out of the way \u2014 far, far east on the Lower East Side \u2014 there's no missing American Realness once you get there. In its seventh edition, this annual festival of contemporary performance announces itself boldly, its name projected in big block letters on the facade of Abrons Arts Center, home to most of the festival's 18 boundary-blurring productions.<\/p><p>It doesn't take much to inject new life into an event sometimes at risk of stagnating, even as it champions the fresh, the unseen, the unexpected. At opening night on Thursday, visitors were guided from show to show through stairwells and hallways generally closed to the public. For anyone well acquainted with Abrons, as many Realness-goers are, this proved a simple, effective way to reinvent familiar spaces.<\/p><p>Masterminded by Thomas Benjamin Snapp Pryor, Realness coincides with the citywide conference of the Association of Performing Arts Presenters \u2014 international curators and producers in the market for new work \u2014 which returns each year like a recurring dream, or nightmare, depending on your relationship to the idea of shopping for live art. Last year's festival was full of work bemoaning the economic plight of performers; this year's first two productions struck out in less sullen directions, while still folding in some self-reflexive critique (also available in the form of Realness swag declaring, \"I Suffer From Realness\").<\/p><p>First was \"Culture Administration & Trembling,\" a biodiverse collaboration among the performers Jennifer Lacey, Antonija Livingstone, Dominique P\u00e9trin and Stephen Thompson. Ticket holders were instructed to remove their shoes, then led to the second floor of the arts complex, where a usually drab lobby had been transformed with geometric and botanical designs on the floor and walls.<\/p><p>Ms. Lacey, Ms. Livingstone, Mr. Thompson and Dana Michel crawled languidly around the asymmetrical room, the audience huddled around the perimeter, to a soundscape of intermittent bird song. Ms. P\u00e9trin appeared just as calmly immersed in her task of adorning the ground with origami squares. Three live snakes, delivered from offstage, soon joined in. Humans and reptiles slid over and around one another.<\/p><p>This was just the first of many tenuously related, increasingly chaotic episodes, including the arrival of two Chihuahuas (the snakes, not to worry, had exited) and a migration into the adjacent black-box theater for a ritualistic ringing of hand-held bells. A mysterious voice, accompanying a video projection, pronounced, \"This piece will not save us.\" Ms. Lacey, cradling a small, three-legged dog while bending and stretching her limbs, told a story about an artist and an institution (Realness, perhaps) trying to spice up their relationship like old lovers. What to do with all this information? I thought of dance as undomesticated wildlife, of the predators and prey involved in buying and selling performance.<\/p><p>Down one set of stairs and up another, in a tucked-away dance studio not often used for performances, the choreographer Heather Kravas, visiting from Seattle, offered the New York premiere of \"dead, disappears.\" Ms. Kravas was her own predator and protector in this stark, self-punishing solo, as she put herself through perilous paces inspired by the sculptor Richard Serra's \"Verb List,\" a series of actions that he associated with making his pieces.<\/p><p>What seemed at first like arbitrary acts of masochism \u2014 walking on tiptoe with a trash bag over her head while barking two-syllable phrases \u2014 deepened into a formidable exploration of language, the female body and the power play between them. Having duct-taped a pillow to a chair, as if it were a prisoner, Ms. Kravas pounded it with a long pole, shouting a list of alphabetized verbs, one per swipe. By the end, in whatever this struggle had been, she had secured the upper hand.<\/p><p>American Realness continues through Jan. 17. Most performances are at Abrons Arts Center, 466 Grand Street, Manhattan; 866-811-4111, americanrealness\u00ad.com.<\/p><p>A version of this review appears in print on January 9, 2016, on page C1 of the New York edition with the headline: Audacious Movements and Slitherings.

Monsanto mon says it is not considering physical barriers like fences or guards.<\/p><p>The FBI and the U.S. Justice Department say cases of espionage in the agriculture sector have been growing since Mo was first discovered digging in an Iowan field in May 2011. Over the past two years, U.S. companies, government research facilities and universities have all been targeted, according to the FBI.<\/p><p>Although prosecutors were unable to establish a Chinese government link to Mo's group, the case adds to U.S.-China frictions over what Washington says is increasing economic espionage and trade secret theft by Beijing and its proxies.<\/p><p>A U.S. law enforcement official told Reuters the agency looked for a connection between the Chinese government and the conspiracy carried out by Mo.<\/p><p>\"In cases like this, we can see connections, but proving to the threshold needed in court requires that we have documents that the government has directed this,\" the official said. \"It's almost impossible to get.\"<\/p><p>A Chinese embassy spokesman in Washington, Zhu Haiquan, said he did not have detailed information on the Mo case but that China \"stands firm\" on the protection of intellectual property and maintains \"constant communication and cooperation\" with the U.S. government on the issue.<\/p><p>On his visit to Washington last September, President Xi Jinping reiterated China's denial of any government role in the hacking of U.S. corporate secrets.<\/p><p>Mo, an employee of Chinese firm Kings Nower Seed, pleaded guilty to stealing seed grown by U.S. firms Monsanto, Dupont Pioneer dd and LG Seeds.<\/p><p>Prosecutors say he specifically targeted fields that grow the parent seeds needed to replicate GMO corn. The FBI says it suspects he was given the location by workers for the seed companies, but did not charge any employees.<\/p><p>DuPont Pioneer and LG Seeds declined to comment for this story.<\/p><p>Mo, whose case was prosecuted by the Justice Department as a national security matter rather than a simple criminal case, now faces a sentence of up to five years in prison. Five others charged in the case are still wanted by the FBI and are believed to have fled to China or Argentina. Charges were dropped against a sixth Chinese suspect.<\/p><p>The number of international economic espionage cases referred to the FBI is rising, up 15% each year between 2009 and 2014 and up 53% in 2015. The majority of cases reported involve Chinese nationals, the U.S. law enforcement official told Reuters. In the agriculture sector, organic insecticide, irrigation equipment and rice, along with corn, are all suspected to have been targeted, including by Chinese nationals, the official said.<\/p><p>Mo Hongjian, vice president of Kings Nower Seed's parent company, Beijing Dabeinong Technology Group, declined to comment on the case or on the company's connection with the Chinese government.<\/p><p>The parent firm is privately owned, but says it receives government money for research in \"science and technology.\"<\/p><p>China bans commercial growing of GMO grains due to public opposition to the technology and imports of GMO corn have to be approved by the agriculture ministry. Still, President Xi called in 2014 for China to innovate and dominate the technique, which promises high yields through resistance to drought, pests and disease.<\/p><p>In January, a Greenpeace report found some Chinese farmers are illegally growing GMO corn whose strains belong to companies including Monsanto, Syngenta syt and DuPont Pioneer.<\/p><p>Monsanto, which supplies Burrack's seed, said it can block foreign groups who request to tour their lab and learning center in Huxley, Iowa. For the past few years, Monsanto says it has run its own background checks on Chinese delegations that ask for a tour, and, if they are approved, boosts security to be sure they do not steal anything or take pictures.<\/p><p>In Washington, U.S. senators have called for a review of the $43 billion deal by state-owned ChemChina to buy Swiss seed group Syngenta, which generates nearly a quarter of its revenue from North America.<\/p><p>Acquiring GMO seed and successfully recreating a corn plant would allow Chinese companies to skip over roughly eight years of research and $1.5 billion spent annually by Monsanto to develop the corn, the company says.<\/p><p>Burrack's farm itself was not targeted by Mo, though he grows the Monsanto parent seed that the Chinese national was digging for. Burrack grows the corn in two fields in front of and behind his house where he can watch them, a small part of his 2,800-acre farm.<\/p><p>He said he is told by Monsanto where and when to plant the parent seed, but has never been told to keep what he is planting a secret.<\/p><p>\"What no one seems to understand is that they're stealing from people like me,\" Burrack said. \"They're stealing the research that farmers pay for when they buy Monsanto seed.\"","446":"While living in an apartment in Pentagon City, Stephanie Gimenez Stahlberg and her husband, Patrick Stahlberg, a software engineer, began searching for a house where they could raise their family.<\/p><p>With two children \u2014 now 31\/2 and 1 1\/2 \u2014 the Stahlbergs needed more space, including a study area for Stephanie, who is enrolled in a PhD program at the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies.<\/p><p>The house they found in Cherrydale, a neighborhood in North Arlington, met their expectations. Within two days on the market, however, there were 10 offers. \"Our was not the highest,\" Stephanie said. \"We wrote a letter to the owners about why we liked the house.\"<\/p><p>The letter, along with a photograph of the family, worked. What drew the Stahlbergs to the house were the solar panels and the trees and bushes \u2014 raspberries, blueberries, blackberries, strawberries, grapes, apples, plums and currants \u2014 growing organically on the property. The Stahlbergs also envisioned finishing the basement bedroom and bathroom for an au pair.<\/p><p>They also fell in love with the neighborhood. They would be within walking distance to a park and two libraries with story time for children.<\/p><p>\"We were trying to look at homes where we can walk to the Metro, or bike to the city or to the Metro,\" said Stephanie, 27.<\/p><p>Sears and Montgomery Ward kit houses: Cherrydale, once abundant with cherry orchards, is a family neighborhood dating to 1893. While many neighbors have lived in the area for as long as 60 years, newcomers move in and out these days, said Kathryn Holt Springston, who worked for the Smithsonian American History Tours Office as an educational specialist and historian for 28 years. She also served as curator and director of the Arlington Historical Museum and editor of the Cherrydale Citizens' Association newsletter.<\/p><p>Single-family homes, the Arlington public schools, access to bike trails and proximity to the District draw people to the neighborhood. Sometimes, though, they move in but stay only a few years. Finding a house in Cherrydale can involve the competitive process the Stahlbergs experienced.<\/p><p>About half a mile north of the Virginia Square and Ballston Metro stations on the Orange and Silver lines, Cherrydale has a variety of residences ranging from farmhouses to bungalows to Sears and Montgomery Ward kit homes with two to five or bedrooms or sometimes more. Many date from 1900 to 1930, though some of the older houses were purchased to be torn down and replaced with larger homes, including some built as recently as this year.<\/p><p>Living there: Cherrydale lies north of Interstate 66 and south of Lorcom Lane, stretching roughly from Utah Street on the west to the northward-curving interstate on the east. The Maywood neighborhood claims the eastern half of those boundaries north of Lee Highway, lending something of an arrowhead shape to Cherrydale. Since 1908, the Cherrydale Citizens' Association has planned activities and resolved neighborhood concerns. In the 1970s and 1980s, people often referred to the neighborhood as Mayberry, according to Springston, 63. In 1948, her parents bought the house where she lives with her husband and son. It dates to 1890, Springston said.<\/p><p>In the neighborhood, 49 properties sold in the past year, according to Billy Buck, an associate broker at Buck & Associates. The lowest priced was a one-bedroom, one-bath condominium for $200,000; the highest priced was a five-bedroom, five-bath farmhouse at $1.63 million. Twelve properties are on the market now, ranging from a one-bedroom, two-bath condo for $274,900 to a new five-bedroom, five-bath Craftsman house at $1.799 million.<\/p><p>Welcome wagon: The five-points intersection \u2014 Lee Highway, Old Dominion Drive, Quincy Street, Military Road and Quebec Street \u2014 is dotted with at least two car dealerships and other commercial establishments while nearby is a Safeway and the Cherrydale Hardware, which opened in 1938.<\/p><p>The Cherrydale Volunteer Fire House, built in 1919, is home to such events as the annual spaghetti dinner, concerts and for 90 years each December there is a visit from Santa Claus for children under 12. Other community events are the annual Fourth of July party and picnic at 21st and Stafford streets. A neighborhood with its own \"welcome wagon,\" Cherrydale has approximately 1,400 households and three parks as well as the Martha Custis Trail for biking, running and walking.<\/p><p>Schools: Glebe Elementary, Taylor Elementary, Swanson Middle, Kenmore Middle and Washington-Lee High.<\/p><p>Transit: The neighborhood is close to the Virginia Square or Ballston Metro stops on the Orange and Silver lines. Metro and Arlington Transit buses connect at Ballston and Virginia Square. Capital Bikeshare also is available.<\/p><p>Crime: From July 2014 through June 2015, according to Arlington County police, one robbery and two burglaries were reported in the area.<\/p><p>Harriet Edleson is a freelance writer.","447":"The Coworking Resources Series is supported by join.me.

Though coworking can have a lot of perks, how you take advantage of them and shape your experience is up to you.<\/p><p>\"We've had people who within the first week they've kind of immersed themselves [in]to events and socializing with other people here, or they're just here, they do their work, and then they take off,\" says Jeff Park, who manages the Ravenswood Coworking Group in Chicago. \"We know that they come in, but I think for them that's enough for them. They just want to be around other people in a productive environment.\"<\/p><p>Whether you're aiming to be as productive as possible without a lot of socializing or trying to build a strong professional community that you can turn to for resources and support, these five tips can help you get the most out of your coworking experience.<\/p><p>Green Spaces, a coworking space in Tribeca, specializes in environmentally focused businesses. Mountain View-based Cubes & Crayons combines childcare and coworking. WorkBar in Boston is hosted in a 2,500-square-foot space and has separate areas for cafe-like and quieter working styles. Coworking Brooklyn uses a small room that functions as an art gallery by night.<\/p><p>The coworking experience varies drastically depending on which space you're using. Different spaces have different levels of interaction with other workers, formality and general vibe. While some spaces, like Green Spaces and Cubes & Crayons, state their niche upfront, you'll only be able to gauge what the environment is like by dropping in. Most spaces have daily drop-in rates. Try a couple of different spaces to see what works best for you before you commit. You can find a list of space around the world on the Coworking Wiki.<\/p><p>\"See if the people in the space are people who you could go and see every day\u2026if it's not, then go to the next space,\" says Jay Catalan, the co-founder of a coworking space in Vancouver called The Network Hub.<\/p><p>It's less awkward to introduce yourself on the first day than to work alongside someone for months before asking their name. Even if you're not usually outgoing, try to make a special effort for the first week or two when you start in a new coworking space.<\/p><p>\"Just make introductions and it goes a long way\u2026We've had some people they wish they had met sooner because it turns out they did similar lines of work and just talking about it or actually sharing work, it's not something you want to find out when you only have a couple more months left on your project or something,\" Park says.<\/p><p>If you're shy about meeting people, try getting creative (like, for instance, bringing food). Bill Jacobson and Dave Ulrich, who co-founded WorkBar, said that one new coworker at WorkBar Boston showed up with a big box of doughnuts. \"He got to know everybody pretty quick,\" Jacobson says.<\/p><p>Don't stop interacting with your coworkers after you introduce yourself. One of the biggest benefits of coworking is the built-in community of professionals working across different industries.<\/p><p>\"It may not seem directly 'productive' to chat with your coworker for 10 minutes mid-day, but indirectly, it yields greater results than almost anything else you could spend time on,\" says Parker Whitney, office manager for Philadelphia coworking space Independents Hall, though he says, \"Invest in your community by taking (not faking) interest in what its members do, and it will take you with it\u2026The people you've always wanted to know are sitting all around you. Ask questions. Learn.

His brother, Larry Pratcher Jr., was ejected from the court room after issuing a string of obscenities.<\/p><p>Kelly's family nodded and clapped, and the victim's father, Landrin Kelly, hugged his wife.<\/p><p>Muriel Pratcher, Pratcher's mother, cried when the verdict was announced, saying, \"Oh my God.\"<\/p><p>\"It was a no-win situation,\" Bernice Moore, Pratcher's grandmother, said outside the courtroom. \"I lost my grandson to prison, Mr. Kelly lost his son forever. We both lost. It's just a tragedy.\"<\/p><p>During the trial, Pratcher's own attorney admitted that the young man fired the four rifle shots that killed Kelly on Aug. 12, 2004 -- two days before the football player was scheduled to move to the University of Oregon on a sports scholarship.<\/p><p>But defense attorney Jonathan Laba argued that Pratcher killed Kelly in a case of mistaken identity. He said that the defendant feared for his life in an unrelated dispute and accidentally shot Kelly as the football player was waiting in a car to give his stepbrother, Brandon Young, a ride home from his girlfriend's house in Richmond's Iron Triangle District.<\/p><p>Laba argued that Pratcher should be convicted of manslaughter because the death was \"a tragic mistake.\"<\/p><p>But prosecutor David Brown told jurors Kelly's death amounted to \"cold-blooded murder,\" because Pratcher was determined to kill someone that night. Brown argued that Pratcher had the opportunity to notice that Kelly was in the car before grabbing the rifle, advancing on the Oldsmobile and opening fire.<\/p><p>\"It's totally unfair for them to say it was premeditated,\" said Pratcher's father, Larry Sr. \"Terrance just came right up; it's impossible for it to be premeditated. It's totally unfair -- my son is not guilty of first degree murder.\"<\/p><p>Pratcher was 15 years old when Kelly was killed and was tried as an adult in Contra Costa County Superior Court. He faces and faces a maximum sentence of 25 years to life.<\/p><p>Kelly died two days before he was to leave for the University of Oregon, where he had a football scholarship and was expected top play safety. His death stunned his hometown of Richmond as well as students, former players and fans at De La Salle in Concord.<\/p><p>Kelly had been named the most valuable player the previous season at De La Salle, where he played linebacker and running back on a team that didn't lose a game in his four years there.<\/p><p>Police arrested Pratcher, whose older brother, Larry Jr., had played youth basketball with Kelly, five days after the killing. Several witnesses placed Pratcher at the crime scene with the rifle, and at least two told investigators they saw him fire into Kelly's car.<\/p><p>Brown offered no motive for the crime but said Pratcher told a friend: \"I had to do what I had to do.\"","449":"Jess Quinn is training for a 10km race.

Get your people together without actually getting them together. Just instantly share your screen so everybody's on the same page. No need for a plane, a projector or a sandwich platter. Just gather at join.me.<\/p><p>If you've decided that it's time to leave your bathrobe at home, let your favorite coffee shop have its corner table back, and join a coworking space, you're only halfway there. Though coworking can have a lot of perks, how you take advantage of them and shape your experience is up to you.<\/p><p>\"We've had people who within the first week they've kind of immersed themselves [in]to events and socializing with other people here, or they're just here, they do their work, and then they take off,\" says Jeff Park, who manages the Ravenswood Coworking Group in Chicago. \"We know that they come in, but I think for them that's enough for them. They just want to be around other people in a productive environment.\"<\/p><p>Whether you're aiming to be as productive as possible without a lot of socializing or trying to build a strong professional community that you can turn to for resources and support, these five tips can help you get the most out of your coworking experience.<\/p><p>Green Spaces, a coworking space in Tribeca, specializes in environmentally focused businesses. Mountain View-based Cubes & Crayons combines childcare and coworking. WorkBar in Boston is hosted in a 2,500-square-foot space and has separate areas for cafe-like and quieter working styles. Coworking Brooklyn uses a small room that functions as an art gallery by night.<\/p><p>The coworking experience varies drastically depending on which space you're using. Different spaces have different levels of interaction with other workers, formality and general vibe. While some spaces, like Green Spaces and Cubes & Crayons, state their niche upfront, you'll only be able to gauge what the environment is like by dropping in. Most spaces have daily drop-in rates. Try a couple of different spaces to see what works best for you before you commit. You can find a list of space around the world on the Coworking Wiki.<\/p><p>\"See if the people in the space are people who you could go and see every day\u2026if it's not, then go to the next space,\" says Jay Catalan, the co-founder of a coworking space in Vancouver called The Network Hub.<\/p><p>It's less awkward to introduce yourself on the first day than to work alongside someone for months before asking their name. Even if you're not usually outgoing, try to make a special effort for the first week or two when you start in a new coworking space.<\/p><p>\"Just make introductions and it goes a long way\u2026We've had some people they wish they had met sooner because it turns out they did similar lines of work and just talking about it or actually sharing work, it's not something you want to find out when you only have a couple more months left on your project or something,\" Park says.<\/p><p>If you're shy about meeting people, try getting creative (like, for instance, bringing food). Bill Jacobson and Dave Ulrich, who co-founded WorkBar, said that one new coworker at WorkBar Boston showed up with a big box of doughnuts. \"He got to know everybody pretty quick,\" Jacobson says.<\/p><p>Don't stop interacting with your coworkers after you introduce yourself. One of the biggest benefits of coworking is the built-in community of professionals working across different industries.<\/p><p>\"It may not seem directly 'productive' to chat with your coworker for 10 minutes mid-day, but indirectly, it yields greater results than almost anything else you could spend time on,\" says Parker Whitney, office manager for Philadelphia coworking space Independents Hall, though he says, \"Invest in your community by taking (not faking) interest in what its members do, and it will take you with it\u2026The people you've always wanted to know are sitting all around you. Ask questions. Learn. Most importantly, help them when you can.\"<\/p><p>If you are too busy during the workday for water cooler conversation, most coworking spaces host happy hours, seminars or other events that are prime opportunities for learning more about your coworkers.<\/p><p>\"Even when you work for yourself, it's important to realize your limitations,\" says Dave Martorana, a freelance Python & iPhone developer who works at Independents Hall. \"If you're a software developer, you're not necessarily a designer, product manager, or marketer as well.

In its seventh edition, this annual festival of contemporary performance announces itself boldly, its name projected in big block letters on the facade of Abrons Arts Center, home to most of the festival's 18 boundary-blurring productions.<\/p><p>It doesn't take much to inject new life into an event sometimes at risk of stagnating, even as it champions the fresh, the unseen, the unexpected. At opening night on Thursday, visitors were guided from show to show through stairwells and hallways generally closed to the public. For anyone well acquainted with Abrons, as many Realness-goers are, this proved a simple, effective way to reinvent familiar spaces.<\/p><p>Masterminded by Thomas Benjamin Snapp Pryor, Realness coincides with the citywide conference of the Association of Performing Arts Presenters \u2014 international curators and producers in the market for new work \u2014 which returns each year like a recurring dream, or nightmare, depending on your relationship to the idea of shopping for live art. Last year's festival was full of work bemoaning the economic plight of performers; this year's first two productions struck out in less sullen directions, while still folding in some self-reflexive critique (also available in the form of Realness swag declaring, \"I Suffer From Realness\").<\/p><p>First was \"Culture Administration & Trembling,\" a biodiverse collaboration among the performers Jennifer Lacey, Antonija Livingstone, Dominique P\u00e9trin and Stephen Thompson. Ticket holders were instructed to remove their shoes, then led to the second floor of the arts complex, where a usually drab lobby had been transformed with geometric and botanical designs on the floor and walls.<\/p><p>Ms. Lacey, Ms. Livingstone, Mr. Thompson and Dana Michel crawled languidly around the asymmetrical room, the audience huddled around the perimeter, to a soundscape of intermittent bird song. Ms. P\u00e9trin appeared just as calmly immersed in her task of adorning the ground with origami squares. Three live snakes, delivered from offstage, soon joined in. Humans and reptiles slid over and around one another.<\/p><p>This was just the first of many tenuously related, increasingly chaotic episodes, including the arrival of two Chihuahuas (the snakes, not to worry, had exited) and a migration into the adjacent black-box theater for a ritualistic ringing of hand-held bells. A mysterious voice, accompanying a video projection, pronounced, \"This piece will not save us.\" Ms. Lacey, cradling a small, three-legged dog while bending and stretching her limbs, told a story about an artist and an institution (Realness, perhaps) trying to spice up their relationship like old lovers.

Within six weeks of the firing on Fort Sumter, Gen. Benjamin Butler was forced to decide what to do with three slaves who escaped to Fortress Monroe on the north shore of Virginia's James River. Butler, certainly no abolitionist, nonetheless refused to return the three to their owner, labeling them \"contrabands of war.\"<\/p><p>The term, suitably ambiguous for an administration that as yet had no policy on how to handle the fugitives, found immediate acceptance. As one Union officer wrote, \"Never was a word so speedily adopted by so many people in so short a time.\" Within weeks hundreds of \"contrabands\" \u2014 men, women and children \u2014 flocked to Fortress Monroe and other Union Army positions. Unsure what might greet them, the escaped slaves were yet confident that life under federal control must surely represent an improvement.<\/p><p>It took the federal government more than a year to devise a policy in answer to this thirst for freedom. In August 1861, the First Confiscation Act stripped slaveholders of their claim of ownership, but it failed to clarify whether the slaves were themselves free. The following March Congress prohibited the military from sending escaped slaves back into slavery, and in July the Second Confiscation Act decreed that all slaves that took refuge in Union areas were \"captives of war\" and would be set free.<\/p><p>These legislative actions took on ever greater significance as Union forces moved deeper and deeper into Confederate territory. The growing number of contrabands reaching federal lines necessitated the establishment of dozens of impromptu contraband camps. A draft map compiled by the National Park Service illustrates how the network of these generally transitory camps mirrored the advance of the Union Army along the Mississippi, Tennessee and Cumberland River systems. Grant's Army of the Tennessee spent the summer of 1862 protecting supply lines in western Tennessee and northern Mississippi. Victories at the Battle of Iuka in September and the Battle of Corinth in early October solidified Union control of the area.<\/p><p>Lincoln's announcement of the preliminary Emancipation Proclamation on Sept. 22, 1862, produced an even greater flood of refugees. How best to use and care for these contrabands proved particularly vexing for military leaders under Grant's command. \"You have no idea of the consternation Old Abe's Proclamation is making,\" wrote Gen. Grenville Dodge to his brother in September. The contrabands \"will not even wait until 1st January. I do not know what we shall do with them.\"<\/p><p>Many of these fugitives arrived in an appalling condition. \"There were men, women, and children in every stage of disease or decrepitude often nearly naked, with flesh torn by the terrible experiences of their escape,\" wrote one observer. \"Often the slaves met prejudices against their color more bitter than any they had left behind.\"<\/p><p>On Nov. 11, 1862, Grant took the first step toward addressing the crisis: he named John Eaton, a former high school principal and chaplain of the 27th Ohio Infantry, as superintendent of contrabands and set him at work \"organizing them into suitable companies for working.\" A month later he went further. \"The negroes will be clothed, and in every way provided for, out of their earnings\" \u2014 about 12.5 cents for each pound of cotton picked \u2014 \"so far as practicable,\" he ordered. \"In no case will negroes be forced into the service of the Government, or be enticed away from their homes except when it becomes a military necessity.\"<\/p><p>Grant's policies lent the contraband camps an official status and began to define what a freedman could and could not do once within the Union lines. Personally, Grant appears to have had no particular sympathy for the refugees. He seems to have recognized that, in the words of one observer, \"The soldiers of our army were a good deal opposed to serving the Negro in any manner.\" Nevertheless, the Union commander unreservedly supported Eaton's work and in the process enabled the creation of one of the war's most successful contraband camps, located at Corinth, Miss.<\/p><p>Although formally organized under the direction of General Dodge in early December 1862 and placed under the command of James M. Alexander, chaplain of the 66th Illinois, the Corinth camp likely came into existence as early as September. Initially housed in army tents no longer considered serviceable for Union troops, the freedmen were soon set to work downing trees and clearing land on which to build cabins and lay out streets, which were named for Union generals. Eventually the freedmen also built a four-room school, a commissary, a hospital, a church and an office. The entire camp was divided into wards, complete with ward masters and a police force.<\/p><p>In late 1862 the American Missionary Association sent its first volunteers to Corinth to help care for, educate and minister to the freedmen. In a memoir written years after the war, one such missionary recalled her experience. \"When brought face to face with the slaves,\" she wrote, \"it was like the discovery of a new race.\" The men and women who came to Corinth generally shared a paternalistic optimism and viewed the freedmen as childlike in their enthusiasm for both education and salvation.<\/p><p>The freedmen's thirst for knowledge was undeniable. \"You will find them every hour of daylight, at their books,\" observed the Rev. Edward Pierce in March of 1863. \"We cannot enter a cabin, or tent, but that we see from one to three with books.\" Within no time Pierce and his wife had more than 150 students, and by the end of the summer, the addition of more missionaries enabled the school to accommodate between 300 and 400 children as well as 60 adults at a night school. In August, one of the teachers estimated that as many as 1,000 freedmen had learned to read in the Corinth camp.<\/p><p>Organized religion followed closely on the heels of formal education. Reverend Olds \"saw an earnestness in reference to the Christian life that I have seldom seen. And as I saw their deep earnestness & heard their hearty responses,\" he said, \"I was led to ask where can we find a more impressible people than these?\"<\/p><p>The population of the camp fluctuated between 1,500 and 6,000, as large groups undertook assignments for the Union Army or contracted to work on local plantations. In March 1863, for example, the camp was home to 658 men, 1,440 women and 1,559 children. Among the men were 36 blacksmiths, 48 carpenters, 180 teamsters and 200 cooks. The female ranks included 80 seamstresses, 150 laundresses and 600 cooks. Two-thirds of the men and three-quarters of the women were married, and seven in eight women had children. According to John Eaton's records, the camp had experienced 900 cases of illness, 189 deaths and 45 births.<\/p><p>Life at Corinth changed dramatically after a May 1863 visit by Adj. Gen. Lorenzo Thomas, who was intent on recruiting thousands of contrabands for his newly formed black regiments. With the organization of the 1st Alabama Infantry of African Descent, later renamed the 55th United States Colored Troops, the camp lost most of its able-bodied men.<\/p><p>Their departure to fight left only the women, the young, the old and the infirm to carry on Eaton's ambitious agricultural program, which rested on the cooperative farming of large tracts of abandoned and confiscated land. The program put 400 acres under cultivation, 300 for cotton and 100 for vegetables. Each cabin also had its own subsistence garden. By May 1863, the success of the agricultural program and the presence of a multitude of skilled artisans produced a clear monthly profit of $4,000 to $5,000 for the government, as well as an admirably independent community that Eaton hoped might serve as a model for other camps.<\/p><p>Unfortunately, the success of the Corinth camp proved short-lived. Plans for a winter campaign by Union forces in January 1864 provided a grim reminder that the fate of the freedmen was always secondary to the triumph of the Union cause. The order to relocate the camp's inhabitants 93 miles westward, to Memphis, \"fell like a bomb-shell among our contented people,\" lamented one missionary, \"but military orders are preemptory,\" and they \"must be obeyed.\" The freedmen left their \"well-organized village,\" gardens and farms to tdiv><\/p><p>The move from Corinth destroyed the spirit that had animated the freedmen's success. Some of the new refugees found work on confiscated plantations or in Memphis, but most lived in one of several camps surrounding the city.<\/p><p>\"The destruction of the Corinth camp,\" noted one historian, \"was one of the tragedies of the Civil War.\" Eaton's plan for large-scale cooperative farming fell victim to a bitter struggle between the War and Treasury departments over the leasing of plantations and was never implemented elsewhere. And no more than one or two other camps were able to replicate the strong civilian leadership, well-planned and policed living environment, and emphasis on education that made Corinth a success.<\/p><p>Had the government learned from the model fashioned in northern Mississippi between the fall of 1862 and early 1864, the newly freed slaves might well have enjoyed a far easier transition to life in postwar America.<\/p><p>Sources: Joseph E.

This is not going away.<\/p><p>But, Newt can turn his pas-de-deux on the loveseat with Nancy into an opportunity to promote a consistent and electable political message.<\/p><p>Because he will be asked about this at every turn, Newt will have the air time and the opportunity to tell the truth on climate change\u2014based upon real science\u2014and to interface it with a limited-government philosophy. The two are easy to do.<\/p><p>Start with the obvious. Instead of waffling on the subject, he could just point out that earth's surface temperature is about 1\u00b0C warmer than it was a century ago. There were two periods of warming, the first from about 1910 through 1945, and the second from the mid-1970s to the late-1990s. They were both roughly the same magnitude. Because the first one was long before we put the majority of fossil carbon into the atmosphere, Newt can say\u2014with scientific authority\u2014that the magnitude of 'natural' climate change is likely to be at least as large as what humans have done.<\/p><p>Then Newt should proceed to the future. It's not the heat, it's the sensitivity. How much it will warm in the future is a function of how sensitive the atmosphere is to doubling atmospheric carbon dioxide. There are a number of independent arguments now coming together showing that this value may have been overestimated. The reference for the most recent is a November issue of Science.<\/p><p>Next, a little refreshing honesty: in 2009, the House of Representatives passed a cap-and-trade bill (which the Senate did not) commanding that the average american\u201438 years from now\u2014be allowed the carbon dioxide emissions of the average citizen in 1867. Prior to its passage, Newt was undeniably for such a system. Newt could call that that the \"second dumbest thing\" he has done and be finished with it.<\/p><p>After setting the record straight, how about interjecting his own political philosophy? When asked what to do about global warming, he should give the honest answer: if the atmosphere indeed is not as sensitive to carbon dioxide changes as previously thought, the correct response is nothing.<\/p><p>That's because \"nothing\" really means something. Newt should channel his historian. When markets are free, capital supports innovation more efficiently than when they aren't. Think about the remarkable changes in energy and technology in the last 100 years. Isn't it rather obvious that the same will occur in the next century, if only we don't hinder capital development? Newt might even use the catchy saw (first sloganed by Northern Illinois Gas in 1972) the future belongs to the efficient, and that there are impressive market forces that advantage those who produce things efficiently or produce efficient things.<\/p><p>When the doomsayers say Newt is believing in a Deus ex machine to dramatically cut carbon dioxide emissions, he might point out that those were the same folks who, only a very few years ago, told us we were running out of natural gas. Innovation and capital revolutionized drilling and fracturing shale, and we now know we have literally hundreds of years of it under our feet. There are a lot more voters and delegates around the country who will benefit from the shale revolution than there are in ethanol-addicted Iowa.","462":"While living in an apartment in Pentagon City, Stephanie Gimenez Stahlberg and her husband, Patrick Stahlberg, a software engineer, began searching for a house where they could raise their family.<\/p><p>With two children \u2014 now 31\/2 and 1 1\/2 \u2014 the Stahlbergs needed more space, including a study area for Stephanie, who is enrolled in a PhD program at the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies.<\/p><p>The house they found in Cherrydale, a neighborhood in North Arlington, met their expectations.

This is not going away.<\/p><p>But, Newt can turn his pas-de-deux on the loveseat with Nancy into an opportunity to promote a consistent and electable political message.<\/p><p>Because he will be asked about this at every turn, Newt will have the air time and the opportunity to tell the truth on climate change\u2014based upon real science\u2014and to interface it with a limited-government philosophy. The two are easy to do.<\/p><p>Start with the obvious. Instead of waffling on the subject, he could just point out that earth's surface temperature is about 1\u00b0C warmer than it was a century ago. There were two periods of warming, the first from about 1910 through 1945, and the second from the mid-1970s to the late-1990s. They were both roughly the same magnitude. Because the first one was long before we put the majority of fossil carbon into the atmosphere, Newt can say\u2014with scientific authority\u2014that the magnitude of 'natural' climate change is likely to be at least as large as what humans have done.<\/p><p>Then Newt should proceed to the future. It's not the heat, it's the sensitivity. How much it will warm in the future is a function of how sensitive the atmosphere is to doubling atmospheric carbon dioxide. There are a number of independent arguments now coming together showing that this value may have been overestimated. The reference for the most recent is a November issue of Science.<\/p><p>Next, a little refreshing honesty: in 2009, the House of Representatives passed a cap-and-trade bill (which the Senate did not) commanding that the average american\u201438 years from now\u2014be allowed the carbon dioxide emissions of the average citizen in 1867. Prior to its passage, Newt was undeniably for such a system. Newt could call that that the \"second dumbest thing\" he has done and be finished with it.<\/p><p>After setting the record straight, how about interjecting his own political philosophy? When asked what to do about global warming, he should give the honest answer: if the atmosphere indeed is not as sensitive to carbon dioxide changes as previously thought, the correct response is nothing.<\/p><p>That's because \"nothing\" really means something. Newt should channel his historian. When markets are free, capital supports innovation more efficiently than when they aren't. Think about the remarkable changes in energy and technology in the last 100 years. Isn't it rather obvious that the same will occur in the next century, if only we don't hinder capital development? Newt might even use the catchy saw (first sloganed by Northern Illinois Gas in 1972) the future belongs to the efficient, and that there are impressive market forces that advantage those who produce things efficiently or produce efficient things.<\/p><p>When the doomsayers say Newt is believing in a Deus ex machine to dramatically cut carbon dioxide emissions, he might point out that those were the same folks who, only a very few years ago, told us we were running out of natural gas. Innovation and capital revolutionized drilling and fracturing shale, and we now know we have literally hundreds of years of it under our feet. There are a lot more voters and delegates around the country who will benefit from the shale revolution than there are in ethanol-addicted Iowa.","466":"Kenneth Ng calls his website a primer for tourists headed to<\/p><p>, but Fodor's it ain't.<\/p><p>The California State University at Northridge professor's site is a one-stop shop for men drawn to the country's sex tourism industry. Dotted with pictures of scantily clad women, the website, BigBabyKenny, advises would-be Johns on the art of negotiating with prostitutes. \"Start with a compliment,\" Ng advises.<\/p><p>Needless to say, Ng's website is causing headaches for Northridge administrators. First publicized by the Los Angeles Daily News, the economics professor's site has drawn a wave of unwelcome attention, forcing administrators to at once criticize its content and defend Ng's right to publish freely on his own time without university resources.<\/p><p>\"Until we find representative evidence that it infringes upon the work he does at the university itself, there's not much we can do about it,\" said Harold Hellenbrand, Northridge's provost.<\/p><p>There may be subtlety in Hellenbrand's words, but his message is clear: If BigBabyKenny infringes on Ng's ability to effectively do his job, then Northridge's position will change. Ng has already said his site is run through a separate server not connected to the university, but Northridge officials might still make a case that the site has interfered with his job. Asked if students complaining that they were no longer comfortable in Ng's class would compel Northridge to demand the site be taken down, Hellenbrand said \"I'm not inviting complaints, but you just hit on the key issue.\"<\/p><p>\"If [running the site is] what he wants to do, and at the same time he wants to educate students and students flock away, then that would create a problem,\" Hellenbrand said.<\/p><p>How Ng came to be identified as the author of BigBabyKenny is a story in itself. A frequent tourist of Thailand, Ng took to blogging on the website of a Bangkok bar called Big Mango Bar. In one controversial post, Ng advised men to seek women near a particular Buddhist shrine.<\/p><p>\"The naysayers will say its creepy to be hanging around the Muariti Shrine, hitting on the emotionally vulnerable girls desperately praying and paying Buddha for a better love life but I beg to differ. Buddha works in mysterious ways,\" he wrote.<\/p><p>Perturbed by the post, the bar owners removed it. That led Ng to start his own site, prompting what Ng describes as a concerted effort by the owners to publicize his penchant for writing about prostitutes. They sent mass e-mails to faculty listed in Northridge's directory, and also posted on RateMyProfessor.com, warning students about Ng, he said.<\/p><p>Ng readily defends the content of his site and says he has no intention of taking it down.<\/p><p>\"The university has no stake in this one way or the other, and besides, professors can say whatever they want,\" said Ng, a tenured associate professor of economics.<\/p><p>Some question whether Ng has crossed a gray legal line, however, by advising men on sex tourism. Patrick Trueman, a former U.S. justice department official, notes that there are several federal statutes that could come into play. Within U.S. Code 18 are two sections \u2013 2422 (a) and 2422 (b) \u2013 that specifically prohibit anyone from \"enticing or coercing a person\" to travel internationally in pursuit of prostitutes. Moreover, one section specifically prohibits the use of the Internet to lure people.<\/p><p>While prostitution may be tolerated in Thailand, that's immaterial under the federal code, Trueman said.<\/p><p>\"Inducing and enticing? Isn't that what this guy's doing?\" said Trueman, former chief of the Justice Department's Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section in the Criminal Division.<\/p><p>Trueman, now a lawyer specializing in sex trafficking and child abuse cases, said there would likely be debate about whether talking about procuring prostitutes online and actually arranging prostitutes for a person should be treated differently under the law.<\/p><p>\"Given how lax the fed government is on these crimes, they may not charge somebody unless they are more directly involved,\" he said. \"That's not to say this person couldn't be charged, and as I read it they could be charged.\"<\/p><p>Beyond the legal implications, critics have already attacked Ng on moral grounds. John Foubert, an Oklahoma State University professor who researches sex trafficking, argues that women \u2013 often minors \u2013 are forced into the sex tourism industry and often have trouble escaping it. Even if Ng is operating within the bounds of the law, Northridge officials have an ethical problem they've yet to face, Foubert said.<\/p><p>\"Do they want to live with the blood on their hands of these girls that are being essentially raped by these men, who are going down and purchasing sex? I think that's a larger question,\" said Foubert, an associate professor of college student development.<\/p><p>Ng said he allows anything to be written on his site, so long as it doesn't involve pedophilia or underage sex. He does, however, write about how difficult it is to effectively negotiate with a \"half or sometimes fully naked teenage girl\" when she's \"expertly gyrating\" on a man's lap.<\/p><p>While his critics have been speaking out since fall, Ng said he has yet to hear from a student who expressed discomfort about his website.<\/p><p>\"The job of the university is to expose students to the world \u2013 not just a politically correct view of the world and not just the good parts of the world,\" he said. \"If a student reads that [site], I personally think it's good for them. They learn about something out there; maybe they disapprove of it and they don't think it's good.\"<\/p><p>You share in the USA TODAY community, so please keep your comments smart and civil.

Fewer voters than expected turned out.<\/p><p>Editor's note: John Avlon is a CNN contributor and senior political columnist for Newsweek and The Daily Beast. He is co-editor of the book \"Deadline Artists: America's Greatest Newspaper Columns.\"<\/p><p>(CNN) -- Beneath Rick Santorum's stunning three-state sweep on Tuesday stands another stubborn sign of dissatisfaction with the status quo: Republican turnout is down.<\/p><p>I'm talking embarrassingly, disturbingly, hey-don't-you-know-it's-an-election-year bad. It is a sign of a serious enthusiasm gap among the rank and file, and a particularly bad omen for Mitt Romney and the GOP in the general election.<\/p><p>Here's the tale of the tape, state by state, beginning with Tuesday night: Minnesota had just more than 47,000 people turn out for its caucuses this year -- four years ago it was nearly 63,000 -- and Romney came in first, not a distant third as he did Tuesday night. In Colorado, more than 70,000 people turned out for its caucus in 2008 -- but in 2012 it was 65,000. And Missouri -- even making a generous discount for the fact that this was an entirely symbolic contest -- had 232,000 people turn out, less than half the number who did four years ago.<\/p><p>Even with months of pre-primary hype and attention solely devoted to the Republican field, turnout in this election cycle essentially flat-lined. In Iowa, a little more than 121,000 people voted, compared with nearly 119,000 four years before, when action in the Democratic caucuses absorbed most of the attention.<\/p><p>In New Hampshire, the same dynamic applied -- 245,000 voters turned out in 2012, compared with 241,000 four years before, despite Republicans being the only game in town and independents making up 47% of the total turnout in 2012, according to CNN exit polls. Take out the independent voters and you've got a deep net decline.<\/p><p>Always proudly rebellious, South Carolina has been the great outlier in this election cycle. With Newt Gingrich making an all-out push for conservatives in a conservative state, turnout was up almost 150,000 over four years before.<\/p><p>But in Florida, the decline became unmistakable. Maybe it decreased because the Romney and Gingrich campaigns, plus super PACS, spent more than $18 million in the Sunshine State on TV ads, of which 93% were negative in the last week alone, according to the Campaign Media Analysis Group. After all, negative ads depress turnout. But after all the mud was thrown, 1.6 million people turned out in the nation's fourth largest state, which might sound impressive until you compare it with the nearly 2 million who turned out in 2008.<\/p><p>Nevada was even worse, with 32,894 people turning out to vote in a state with more than 465,000 registered Republicans. Four years before, more than 44,300 participated in the caucus. Turnout was down more than 25% despite the GOP caucuses being the only game in town. Party officials were expecting a turnout of more than 70,000.<\/p><p>All this should be a wake-up call for the GOP. Despite an enormous amount of national media attention devoted to each of the states to date, the response has been a notable yawn among the Republican rank and file.<\/p><p>The turnout numbers are even worse when you compare them with the number of registered Republicans in each state that has voted to date.<\/p><p>The caucuses in particular bring out an unrepresentative sample of a state's Republican Party. For all the grass-roots romanticism, there has got to be a better way to pick a presidential nominee.<\/p><p>But the news is worst for Romney, long the presumptive front-runner in a party that tends to reward the man next in line.<\/p><p>\"Reluctantly Romney\" could be a bumper sticker, even for his supporters. The former Massachusetts governor has found it difficult to climb above 35% in national polls, meaning that a majority of Republicans still support someone else in a notably weak field. His vote margins and totals lag behind those of four years before, when he lost the nomination to John McCain in a crowded and comparatively competent field, although Minnesota is the first state he won in '08 and lost in 2012.<\/p><p>You reap what you sow, and part of the reason turnout is down is directly related to the problem of polarization. The Republican Party is more ideologically polarized than at any time in recent history. Therefore, it put up more purely right-wing candidates than it did four years before, when center-right leaders such as McCain and Rudy Giuliani were also in the race. A bigger tent inspired bigger turnout.<\/p><p>But the other reason is simple dissatisfaction with the candidates.<\/p><p>Republicans seem united in their anger against the president -- like the Democrats in 2004 -- but they are uninspired by their options. Draft movements for fantasy candidates ranging from Chris Christie to Mitch Daniels to Paul Ryan and even Jeb Bush have started and failed. Some party leaders show more enthusiasm for a hypothetical 2016 crop of candidates, including Marco Rubio and Bobby Jindal, than they do for the flawed choices before them in this election. Divided and dispirited is an odd place for the Republican Party to be so soon after the enthusiasms of the 2010 tea party-driven election.<\/p><p>The bottom line is that voter turnout matters. And what should be most troubling for Republicans is that this enthusiasm gap among the conservative base is accompanied by a lack of candidates who might appeal to independents and centrist swing voters in the general election. It is a double barrel of bad news for the Republican Party. The numbers can be spun and rationalized by professional partisan operatives all day long, but the fact remains -- voters just aren't turning out to cast their votes for this crop of conservative candidates in 2012.<\/p><p>Follow CNN Opinion on Twitter.<\/p><p>Join the conversation on Facebook.<\/p><p>The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John Avlon.","468":"Milton Friedman (1912--2006), the champion of free-market economics and the hero of my student years at the University of Chicago, would have been appalled at the recent intrusion of government into the marketplace.

Small businesses and families starving for credit will eventually get relief as the funding props up banks and they increase lending, but Rajoy didn't offer guidance on when.<\/p><p>Spain on Saturday became the fourth \u2014 and largest \u2014 of the 17 countries that use Europe's common currency to request a bailout \u2014 a big blow to a nation that a few years ago took pride as the continent's economic superstar only to see it become the hot spot in the eurozone debt crisis. Its economy is the eurozone's fourth largest after Germany, France and Italy.<\/p><p>Across the country, Spaniards reacted with a mixture of anger and relief to the news. The amount of the rescue fund, if all is tapped, amounts to \u20ac21,000 of new debt for each person in the nation of 47 million where the average annual salary for those with work is about the same amount and the unemployment rate for those under age 25 is 52 percent.<\/p><p>The country is already reeling from deep austerity cuts Rajoy has imposed over the last six months that have raised taxes, made it easier to hire and fire workers, and cut deep into cherished government programs including education and national health care.<\/p><p>\"It's obviously a shame,\" said civil servant Luisa Saraguren, 44, as she strolled on a sunny Sunday morning with her young daughter. \"But this bailout was fully predictable, and the consequences of this help are going to be a lot bigger compared to the cuts we've been living with already.\"<\/p><p>Rajoy took pains to avoid the word bailout Sunday, saying Spain's rescue package is a line of credit that its most troubled banks will be able to tap. The assistance will not come with the outside control over government macroeconomic policy like that imposed Greece, Ireland and Portugal when their public finances were bailed out.<\/p><p>He said interest rates on the loans will be considerably lower than the rate near 7 percent that Spain has been forced to pay recently on the international debt markets, a level that forced the other countries to seek bailouts.<\/p><p>Spain will regain the economic credibility it has lost by shoring up its banks, which will result in credit being restored so businesses and individuals shut off from loans can start borrowing and the economy will grow again, Rajoy insisted, again without saying when.<\/p><p>Europe's widening recession and financial crisis has hurt companies and investors around the world. Providing a financial lifeline to Spanish banks is likely to relieve anxiety on the Spanish economy \u2014 which is five times larger than Greece's \u2014 and on markets concerned about the country's ability to pay its way.<\/p><p>Spain's financial problems are not due to Greek-style government over-spending. The country's banks particularly its savings banks or \"cajas,\" got caught up in the collapse of a real estate bubble in 2008 that got worse over the past four years. However, as Spain's leaders have struggled for a solution to their banking crisis, the country's borrowing costs have soared close to the level that forced the governments of Greece, Portugal and Ireland to seek rescues.<\/p><p>Some of Spain's banks are struggling with by toxic real estate loans and assets amid fears the problem will get worse as more jobless people can't pay their mortgages. The Bank of Spain says the toxic loans and assets total around \u20ac180 billion. Nationalized lender Bankia SA, which has requested \u20ac19 billion in aid, has \u20ac32 billion in toxic assets. Around four other banks serving the domestic market are considered prime candidates for bailouts.<\/p><p>\"I could never get my mind round the scale of consumption in Spain over the past 20 years, having known it in the 1960s when it was still extremely poor,\" said Paul Preston, a history professor and expert on Spain with the London School of Economics. \"Lots of people enjoyed the consumer boom, but not everybody. Now everybody's having to pay for it.\"<\/p><p>Rajoy blamed Spain's woes on the previous Socialist administration of Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero without mentioning him or his government by name. Zapatero was ousted by Rajoy in a landslide last November by voters outraged over the Socialist handling of the economy.<\/p><p>\"Last year Spain's public administration spent \u20ac90 billion more than it took in, this can't be maintained, we can't live like that,\" Rajoy said.<\/p><p>But Socialist Party leader Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba said Rajoy should acknowledge that Spain is now in bailout territory.<\/p><p>\"The government is trying to make us believe that we've won the lottery, that the Three Kings of Orient have arrived, and that isn't so,\" Rubalcaba said.<\/p><p>After his press conference, Rajoy defended his decision to jet off an hour later to Poland to see Spain's famed national football team take on Italy in the Euro 2012 competition. He said he would be on the ground in Gdansk only for the game before flying back to Madrid Sunday night.<\/p><p>\"I'll be there two and a half hours and then I'll leave,\" Rajoy said. \"I think the national team deserves it.\"","470":"The Coworking Resources Series is supported by join.me. Get your people together without actually getting them together. Just instantly share your screen so everybody's on the same page. No need for a plane, a projector or a sandwich platter. Just gather at join.me.<\/p><p>If you've decided that it's time to leave your bathrobe at home, let your favorite coffee shop have its corner table back, and join a coworking space, you're only halfway there. Though coworking can have a lot of perks, how you take advantage of them and shape your experience is up to you.<\/p><p>\"We've had people who within the first week they've kind of immersed themselves [in]to events and socializing with other people here, or they're just here, they do their work, and then they take off,\" says Jeff Park, who manages the Ravenswood Coworking Group in Chicago. \"We know that they come in, but I think for them that's enough for them. They just want to be around other people in a productive environment.\"<\/p><p>Whether you're aiming to be as productive as possible without a lot of socializing or trying to build a strong professional community that you can turn to for resources and support, these five tips can help you get the most out of your coworking experience.<\/p><p>Green Spaces, a coworking space in Tribeca, specializes in environmentally focused businesses. Mountain View-based Cubes & Crayons combines childcare and coworking. WorkBar in Boston is hosted in a 2,500-square-foot space and has separate areas for cafe-like and quieter working styles. Coworking Brooklyn uses a small room that functions as an art gallery by night.<\/p><p>The coworking experience varies drastically depending on which space you're using. Different spaces have different levels of interaction with other workers, formality and general vibe. While some spaces, like Green Spaces and Cubes & Crayons, state their niche upfront, you'll only be able to gauge what the environment is like by dropping in. Most spaces have daily drop-in rates. Try a couple of different spaces to see what works best for you before you commit. You can find a list of space around the world on the Coworking Wiki.<\/p><p>\"See if the people in the space are people who you could go and see every day\u2026if it's not, then go to the next space,\" says Jay Catalan, the co-founder of a coworking space in Vancouver called The Network Hub.<\/p><p>It's less awkward to introduce yourself on the first day than to work alongside someone for months before asking their name. Even if you're not usually outgoing, try to make a special effort for the first week or two when you start in a new coworking space.<\/p><p>\"Just make introductions and it goes a long way\u2026We've had some people they wish they had met sooner because it turns out they did similar lines of work and just talking about it or actually sharing work, it's not something you want to find out when you only have a couple more months left on your project or something,\" Park says.<\/p><p>If you're shy about meeting people, try getting creative (like, for instance, bringing food). Bill Jacobson and Dave Ulrich, who co-founded WorkBar, said that one new coworker at WorkBar Boston showed up with a big box of doughnuts. \"He got to know everybody pretty quick,\" Jacobson says.<\/p><p>Don't stop interacting with your coworkers after you introduce yourself. One of the biggest benefits of coworking is the built-in community of professionals working across different industries.<\/p><p>\"It may not seem directly 'productive' to chat with your coworker for 10 minutes mid-day, but indirectly, it yields greater results than almost anything else you could spend time on,\" says Parker Whitney, office manager for Philadelphia coworking space Independents Hall, though he says, \"Invest in your community by taking (not faking) interest in what its members do, and it will take you with it\u2026The people you've always wanted to know are sitting all around you. Ask questions. Learn. Most importantly, help them when you can.\"<\/p><p>If you are too busy during the workday for water cooler conversation, most coworking spaces host happy hours, seminars or other events that are prime opportunities for learning more about your coworkers.<\/p><p>\"Even when you work for yourself, it's important to realize your limitations,\" says Dave Martorana, a freelance Python & iPhone developer who works at Independents Hall. \"If you're a software developer, you're not necessarily a designer, product manager, or marketer as well. When you work at a coworking space, people with those skills probably work right next to you and are just as interested in building something awesome as you are.\"<\/p><p>While coworking one day, I ended up testing someone's website, getting caught in the crossfire of a music choice showdown, and participating in a raised-hand vote about which suit jacket a fellow coworker should wear to a meeting. Needless to say, the social aspects of coworking \u2014 despite their advantages \u2014 can be extremely distracting.<\/p><p>Which is why out of the 37 productivity tips that I collected for a previous article, this one from Paul Preibisch of B3D Multitech remains my favorite:<\/p><p>\"Rather than standing up from behind your wall of monitors and shouting, 'Can you all shut up?!' you may want to consider, what I call 'The Cone of Silence.' It really works! All you need are a nice pair of headphones, (not earbuds), a wave file that plays 'white noise,' and Windows Media Player set to auto-repeat.\"<\/p><p>The Coworking Resources Series is supported by join.me.

In its seventh edition, this annual festival of contemporary performance announces itself boldly, its name projected in big block letters on the facade of Abrons Arts Center, home to most of the festival's 18 boundary-blurring productions.<\/p><p>It doesn't take much to inject new life into an event sometimes at risk of stagnating, even as it champions the fresh, the unseen, the unexpected. At opening night on Thursday, visitors were guided from show to show through stairwells and hallways generally closed to the public. For anyone well acquainted with Abrons, as many Realness-goers are, this proved a simple, effective way to reinvent familiar spaces.<\/p><p>Masterminded by Thomas Benjamin Snapp Pryor, Realness coincides with the citywide conference of the Association of Performing Arts Presenters \u2014 international curators and producers in the market for new work \u2014 which returns each year like a recurring dream, or nightmare, depending on your relationship to the idea of shopping for live art. Last year's festival was full of work bemoaning the economic plight of performers; this year's first two productions struck out in less sullen directions, while still folding in some self-reflexive critique (also available in the form of Realness swag declaring, \"I Suffer From Realness\").<\/p><p>First was \"Culture Administration & Trembling,\" a biodiverse collaboration among the performers Jennifer Lacey, Antonija Livingstone, Dominique P\u00e9trin and Stephen Thompson. Ticket holders were instructed to remove their shoes, then led to the second floor of the arts complex, where a usually drab lobby had been transformed with geometric and botanical designs on the floor and walls.<\/p><p>Ms. Lacey, Ms. Livingstone, Mr. Thompson and Dana Michel crawled languidly around the asymmetrical room, the audience huddled around the perimeter, to a soundscape of intermittent bird song. Ms. P\u00e9trin appeared just as calmly immersed in her task of adorning the ground with origami squares. Three live snakes, delivered from offstage, soon joined in. Humans and reptiles slid over and around one another.<\/p><p>This was just the first of many tenuously related, increasingly chaotic episodes, including the arrival of two Chihuahuas (the snakes, not to worry, had exited) and a migration into the adjacent black-box theater for a ritualistic ringing of hand-held bells. A mysterious voice, accompanying a video projection, pronounced, \"This piece will not save us.\" Ms. Lacey, cradling a small, three-legged dog while bending and stretching her limbs, told a story about an artist and an institution (Realness, perhaps) trying to spice up their relationship like old lovers. What to do with all this information? I thought of dance as undomesticated wildlife, of the predators and prey involved in buying and selling performance.<\/p><p>Down one set of stairs and up another, in a tucked-away dance studio not often used for performances, the choreographer Heather Kravas, visiting from Seattle, offered the New York premiere of \"dead, disappears.\" Ms. Kravas was her own predator and protector in this stark, self-punishing solo, as she put herself through perilous paces inspired by the sculptor Richard Serra's \"Verb List,\" a series of actions that he associated with making his pieces.<\/p><p>What seemed at first like arbitrary acts of masochism \u2014 walking on tiptoe with a trash bag over her head while barking two-syllable phrases \u2014 deepened into a formidable exploration of language, the female body and the power play between them. Having duct-taped a pillow to a chair, as if it were a prisoner, Ms. Kravas pounded it with a long pole, shouting a list of alphabetized verbs, one per swipe. By the end, in whatever this struggle had been, she had secured the upper hand.<\/p><p>American Realness continues through Jan. 17.

Tight end Vernon Davis? He has eight targets in the past three games.<\/p><p>It's hard to argue with Kaepernick's pecking order, given the results.<\/p><p>In a 41-34 win over the Patriots on Sunday, Crabtree (7 catches, 107 yards, 2 TDs) was featured on the 49ers' first possession - a tone-setting 63-yard touchdown march - with drive-opening catches of 11 and 13 yards. Kaepernick also threw his final pass to Crabtree, a 38-yard game-winner on a play that wasn't designed for San Francisco's No. 1 wide receiver.<\/p><p>In his past three games, Crabtree has 23 catches for 301 yards and two touchdowns with 90-plus receiving yards in each game. Prior to his streak, he had 90-plus receiving yards in five of the first 53 games of his four-year career.<\/p><p>In his five starts, Kaepernick has a 113.6 rating when targeting Crabtree, who has helped earn his confidence with reliable hands. According to Pro Football Focus, Crabtree has three drops in Kaepernick's starts, an impressive figure given the heat the Howitzer-armed quarterback puts on his throws.<\/p><p>On KNBR Tuesday, Harbaugh, who famously declared in the offseason Crabtree had the best hands he'd ever seen, crowed a bit when asked if there was a special Kaepernick-Crabtree chemistry.<\/p><p>\"Yeah, I think there is,\" Harbaugh said. \"But Michael has been doing this all year now. Talked about it every week, the ability to catch, nobody catches the ball better than Michael Crabtree. I think back to last summer when we were talking about the same topic. It might have even been on this show. A lot of people 'What? The greatest hands you've ever seen?' Nobody mentions that any more. Boy, the evidence sure is there.\"<\/p><p>With at least 10 catches and 132 yards over the final two regular-season games, Crabtree (73 catches, 868 yards) would become the 49ers' first 1,000-yard receiver since Terrell Owens in 2003 and will have the most receptions since Owens hauled in 100 in 2002.<\/p><p>Davis, who had team-highs in targets (eight), receptions (six) and yards (83) in Kaepernick's first start against Chicago last month, has since become an afterthought. He had one catch for 10 yards against the Patriots, and four catches, 29 yards and nine targets over the last four games.<\/p><p>Davis said he's yet to establish a chemistry with Kaepernick that matches the connection he had with former starter Alex Smith.<\/p><p>\"You have to develop that chemistry, that bond so you can be on the same page,\" Davis said. \"That's something me and Kaep don't have right now. We don't have it. You have to expect it because he just stepped in. Me and Alex, we've been here.\"<\/p><p>Asked why Crabtree has been quick to get on the same page, Davis said the red-hot wide receiver has been running shorter routes. However, he also noted, as Kaepernick did Sunday night, that Crabtree has earned his targets by breaking free from coverage.<\/p><p>\"Crab is a pretty good route runner,\" Davis said. \"He's getting open and Kaep is finding him.\"<\/p><p>Eric Branch is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.

It's a sci-fi showpiece. It's an ultralight carbon-fiber production car. It's a triumph of parts-bin engineering. It's a take-no-prisoners canyon racer. It's a winged chariot of the Malibu \u00fcber-chic. It's a $136,625 (destination included!) commuter car for Silicon Valley moguls.<\/p><p>The hardware, at least, is straightforward. The central passenger shell is a stiff, lightweight carbon-fiber structure. It is bolted to an aluminum skeleton that holds the 7.1-kilowatt-hour lithium-ion battery pack in its spine.<\/p><p>An electric drive section similar to the one in the BMW i3 people pod is bolted to the front, its 131 horsepower electric motor and 2-speed automatic transmission driving the front wheels. The rear power package is sourced from the new Mini; its 3-cylinder, twin-turbocharged 231-horsepower engine drives the rear wheels through a 6-speed automatic transmission.<\/p><p>The multilayered skin is molded thermoplastic that weighs half as much as steel. Other extreme weight-saving measures, including aluminum wiring and chemically hardened ultrathin glass, keep the weight to 3,267 pounds. The long, light doors swing up and forward. From the front, with doors open, the i8 looks as if it's signaling a touchdown.<\/p><p>The interior is compact yet comfortable, though those over 6-foot-2 may need more legroom, and the rear seats are designed for tiny, limber people.<\/p><p>Getting in is a challenge. The sill is wide, the seat is low, and there's a trick: sit sideways, slide butt in, retract legs. Getting out? Imagine climbing from a bathtub without using your hands.<\/p><p>Pick a personality with the driving-mode buttons. \"Comfort\" keeps the car in electric mode to 37 m.p.h., or until you mash the right-side pedal. The eDrive button keeps things electric to 75 m.p.h. or until the battery fades.<\/p><p>Travel range is about 20 miles in E.V. mode, and recharging takes 1.5 hours at 240 volts or four hours at 120. The Eco-Pro button increases electric efficiency 20 percent by softening the motor response and optimizing climate-control settings. I observed gasoline-powered mileage figures from 27 m.p.g. (impatient cornering) to 37 m.p.g. (safe-and-sane commuting).<\/p><p>In the city, the i8 feels silent, solid and intuitive \u2014 the excitement happens outside, as gawkers track its progress.<\/p><p>On Los Angeles's well-used freeways, the Comfort setting leaves some comfort to be desired. Even with the variable dampers at full soft, the i8 bobs its nose like Muhammad Ali in the first rounds. High-performance tires come standard in the United States; European versions get narrower wheels and taller tires for lower drag and a smoother ride.<\/p><p>In Sport mode, the suspension and steering stiffen and the gas engine roars, pops on upshifts and matches revs downshifting into corners. It sounds great, and it should: much of what you hear is a prerecorded soundtrack piped through the sound system.<\/p><p>The i8 feels strong at full power, but the head-snapping response expected from a partly electric powertrain is absent. The i8 takes time to gather itself, with an atavistic vestige of turbo lag.<\/p><p>On the intestinal twists of Mulholland Highway the i8 can be driven with brutal abandon. The brakes are strong, the chassis is as stiff as a bank vault, and there's enough power to reach the next corner presently. BMW claims a 0-to-60 time of 4.2 seconds, and top speed is 155 m.p.h.<\/p><p>The front tires push when going hard into corners, but everything sticks coming out. Even with the stability control off, the i8 resists spinning its tires \u2014 the software ghost is still there, lurking in the machine.<\/p><p>The i8 is complicated and imperfect. A car that will be used for emissions-free commuting should allow people to get in and get out. It rides harshly. The exterior design is too clever \u2014 the layered rear deck whispers \"Your trunk is open.\"<\/p><p>Still, if the i8 represents the future of sports cars, things are looking bright.<\/p><p>A version of this review appears in print on May 11, 2014, on page AU4 of the New York edition with the headline: The Future Will See You Now.

The American people rejected that, and Republicans shouldn't be doubling down on it.\"<\/p><p>The White House effort comes three days before Obama releases his 2014 budget, which is expected to include a mix of tax increases and cuts to such entitlements as Social Security and Medicare.<\/p><p>\"You can do both,\" Pfeiffer said on ABC's \"This Week.\" \"That's what you'll see. \u2026 What we won't do is cut our way to prosperity.\"<\/p><p>However, the outline of the plan has already been criticized by Republicans and some of the president's staunchest supporters.<\/p><p>The release of the budget Wednesday, which will be followed by Obama meeting for dinner with Senate Republicans, is just part of a busy week in Washington.<\/p><p>Congress returns from a two-week break with the Senate attempting to reach a bipartisan agreement on immigration-reform legislation, and the leaders of the Democrat-controlled chamber trying to finish a gun-control proposal that might or might not include the contentious universal background checks for buyers.<\/p><p>Pfeiffer told Fox the meeting with Senate Republicans is simply an attempt to find a \"caucus of common sense,\" not end run leaders of the Republican-controlled House.<\/p><p>Last week, House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, said Obama's budget blueprint holds reforms \"hostage\" to tax increases.

When the shoebox-shaped and nearly shoebox-size panini shop opened on Bedford Street 15 years ago, there was nothing quite like it in New York, a restaurant that kept things simple and kept prices low, serving flavorful food in a room that was just adorable enough that you could decide, midmeal, that maybe the two of you squeezed into the counter were there on a date, and not just grabbing a bite.<\/p><p>You have to fire up the Wayback Machine to better understand how 'ino helped change how this city eats. Fifteen years ago, New York was a bistro town. There was the old guard: Blue Ribbon, Le Gamin, Jules, Lucky Strike, Raoul's and a dozen others. Then in 1997, a newcomer opened in SoHo named Balthazar, which raised the stakes with its set direction and unlisted reservation line. Balthazar was white-hot: it had perfectly distressed mirrors, fresh and crusty bread, and although it was impossible to get a table unless you knew somebody who knew somebody, you could always go at midnight and eat at the bar.<\/p><p>Soon, New York was lousy with bistros. It was a good era if you wanted a kir, steak frites, escargot, fris\u00e9e lardon, profiteroles. Authenticity, or some version of it, was the point. Everybody was pressing butter into little ramekins to be served at room temperature, changing the paper covering the tablecloths before serving dessert.<\/p><p>Honestly, it was really fun. The restaurants were lively, intimate, sexy. So what if you could recite the menu before you set foot in the door? But if you were a young chef with a measure of vision and creativity, you were stuck either making onion soup and beet salad with goat cheese. Or you worked on the line executing the vision and creativity of an older chef in Midtown or TriBeCa. Prune hadn't yet opened. Neither had Diner. Brooklyn didn't have much of a food scene outside the restaurant row on Smith Street, which was anchored by Patois, a bistro. If you went to Williamsburg, it was to go to a party or to go dancing, not to eat. This was the landscape when Jason and Jennifer Denton opened 'ino on a quiet street in the West Village. The kitchen in the back was the size of a D.J. booth and used the technology of induction burners, which was novel at the time: it was a paninoteca that looked as if it belonged in New York rather than being shipped, tile by mirrored tile, from Milan.<\/p><p>The culinary vocabulary was Italian, but it wasn't sepia-toned and sentimental. Instead, there was a focus on ingredients at a time when, in New York at least, few people cared. It had simple food done well, and sometimes you encountered flavors that weren't lifted out of the songbook. I still have a 13-year-old memory of sharing a shredded duck sandwich with sweet relish, a combination that is about as authentically Italian as a functioning parliament. You could go to 'ino to get something familiar (prosciutto and cheese will never get old), but you could also try something new.<\/p><p>'Ino was a casual joint with integrity, an easygoing place where you could eat well as long as you didn't mind the wait. Today, we take this combination for granted, and expect all kitchens to put some effort into sourcing and display a little creativity no matter how limited the resources. That we do owes a little bit to 'ino.","477":"The White House tried Sunday to win support for President Obama's forthcoming budget, arguing the plan is a balanced approach to economic prosperity and warning Republicans about stonewalling negotiations and pushing a \"rejected\" Romney plan.<\/p><p>\"Right now, the approach of many Republicans, particularly the leadership in the House, is my way or the highway,\" senior White House adviser Dan Pfeiffer told \"Fox News Sunday.\" \"Their view is the only acceptable plan is to try to \u2026 essentially enact the Romney economic plan. The American people rejected that, and Republicans shouldn't be doubling down on it.\"<\/p><p>The White House effort comes three days before Obama releases his 2014 budget, which is expected to include a mix of tax increases and cuts to such entitlements as Social Security and Medicare.<\/p><p>\"You can do both,\" Pfeiffer said on ABC's \"This Week.\" \"That's what you'll see. \u2026 What we won't do is cut our way to prosperity.\"<\/p><p>However, the outline of the plan has already been criticized by Republicans and some of the president's staunchest supporters.<\/p><p>The release of the budget Wednesday, which will be followed by Obama meeting for dinner with Senate Republicans, is just part of a busy week in Washington.<\/p><p>Congress returns from a two-week break with the Senate attempting to reach a bipartisan agreement on immigration-reform legislation, and the leaders of the Democrat-controlled chamber trying to finish a gun-control proposal that might or might not include the contentious universal background checks for buyers.<\/p><p>Pfeiffer told Fox the meeting with Senate Republicans is simply an attempt to find a \"caucus of common sense,\" not end run leaders of the Republican-controlled House.<\/p><p>Last week, House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, said Obama's budget blueprint holds reforms \"hostage\" to tax increases.

With Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, Connie Nielsen, Oliver Reed. Directed by Ridley Scott. At area theaters. Running time: 154 mins. Rated R: Gory violence, incest theme. 3 1\/2 Stars.<\/p><p>If there's a soft spot in your heart for the sword-&-sandal epic - and from the star rating above, I think you can guess where I stand - then you'll swoon with giddy delight over \"Gladiator,\" a sweaty, stylish hunkfest that takes you back to the days of \"Ben-Hur,\" \"Spartacus\" and the so recently departed Steve Reeves.<\/p><p>From his biceps to his gluteus, Maximus is maximus. This Roman general turned slave turned gladiator hasn't a shred of humor, but then, he doesn't have time for idle nonsense when he's lopping off heads all day. (The head-lopping is apparently his signature, like the mark of Zorro.)<\/p><p>In director Ridley Scott's thrilling, burnished epic, Maximus no sooner serves the empire by leveling Germania during a snowstorm than Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) tosses him a promotion he doesn't want - to succeed the aged emperor and whip Rome back into shape. All Maximus wants is to go home to his wife and child in the suburbs.<\/p><p>The careworn Russell Crowe is physically and temperamentally perfect for the part of Maximus. Still carrying some of the weight he packed on for \"The Insider,\" he's no gym-toned pretty boy. He's solid, beefy, rough-hewn, creaking along in his heavy leather costume, with a look on his puss of weary disdain.<\/p><p>What makes him sexy is his sense of honor and loyalty: \"What we do in life echoes in eternity!\" Anyway, it can't be his hygiene, although he is frequently bathed in a sanctifying golden glow.<\/p><p>After a coup by the emperor's weak-kneed son, Commodus (a whiny, surprisingly fleshy Joaquin Phoenix), Maximus' fortunes change. He winds up being thrown to the tigers, two shows daily, in Rome's Colosseum, the entertainment complex of its day.<\/p><p>Crowe, like his character, must grimly come to terms with the fact that, actor or gladiator, it's all about showmanship. Give the crowd what it wants, either at the multiplex or in the arena, and you can write your own ticket.<\/p><p>\"I have power only to amuse the mob,\" he spits contemptuously like a Shakespearean actor reduced to dinner theater.<\/p><p>The plot, about avenging honor, provides brief respite between an array of hand-to-hand battles that are pitched so furiously that individual components barely register; they're subliminal suggestions of computer-assisted carnage, with Jackson Pollock sprays of blood. For fans of the genre, yes, this is a good thing.<\/p><p>Connie Nielsen plays Commodus' sister and possible love interest for Maximus once his family is dispatched (politics, you know). Nielsen's costumes are laced up like bondage gear, and there is a tantalizing hint of romance past.<\/p><p>But the camera only has eyes for Crowe. The glowering! The seething! The hooded gaze! The quiet suffering! (Watch him carve away a tattoo he no longer has use for. No anesthetic! No disinfectant!)<\/p><p>The supporting cast makes for a gauntlet of worthy friends and adversaries, all of them thinkers, including Derek Jacobi (\"I, Claudius\") as a senator, Djimon Hounsou (\"Amistad\") as a fellow gladiator and Oliver Reed, who died with two days to go on the shoot, looking a little woozy as a gladiator entrepreneur.<\/p><p>Reed's character is the one most in touch with the movie's premise - that entertainment is the goal, and a worthy one at that.","479":"MADRID (AP) \u2013 Spain's grinding economic misery will get worse this year despite the country's request for a European financial lifeline of up to $125 billion to save its banks, Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said Sunday.<\/p><p>A day after the country conceded it needed outside help following months of denying it would seek assistance, Rajoy said more Spaniards will lose their jobs in a country where one out of every four are already unemployed.<\/p><p>\"This year is going to be a bad one,\" Rajoy said Sunday in his first comments about the rescue since it was announced the previous evening by his economy minister.<\/p><p>The conservative prime minister added that the economy, stuck in its second recession in three years, will still contract the previously predicted 1.7 percent even with the help. Small businesses and families starving for credit will eventually get relief as the funding props up banks and they increase lending, but Rajoy didn't offer guidance on when.<\/p><p>Spain on Saturday became the fourth \u2014 and largest \u2014 of the 17 countries that use Europe's common currency to request a bailout \u2014 a big blow to a nation that a few years ago took pride as the continent's economic superstar only to see it become the hot spot in the eurozone debt crisis. Its economy is the eurozone's fourth largest after Germany, France and Italy.<\/p><p>Across the country, Spaniards reacted with a mixture of anger and relief to the news. The amount of the rescue fund, if all is tapped, amounts to \u20ac21,000 of new debt for each person in the nation of 47 million where the average annual salary for those with work is about the same amount and the unemployment rate for those under age 25 is 52 percent.<\/p><p>The country is already reeling from deep austerity cuts Rajoy has imposed over the last six months that have raised taxes, made it easier to hire and fire workers, and cut deep into cherished government programs including education and national health care.<\/p><p>\"It's obviously a shame,\" said civil servant Luisa Saraguren, 44, as she strolled on a sunny Sunday morning with her young daughter. \"But this bailout was fully predictable, and the consequences of this help are going to be a lot bigger compared to the cuts we've been living with already.\"<\/p><p>Rajoy took pains to avoid the word bailout Sunday, saying Spain's rescue package is a line of credit that its most troubled banks will be able to tap. The assistance will not come with the outside control over government macroeconomic policy like that imposed Greece, Ireland and Portugal when their public finances were bailed out.<\/p><p>He said interest rates on the loans will be considerably lower than the rate near 7 percent that Spain has been forced to pay recently on the international debt markets, a level that forced the other countries to seek bailouts.<\/p><p>Spain will regain the economic credibility it has lost by shoring up its banks, which will result in credit being restored so businesses and individuals shut off from loans can start borrowing and the economy will grow again, Rajoy insisted, again without saying when.<\/p><p>Europe's widening recession and financial crisis has hurt companies and investors around the world. Providing a financial lifeline to Spanish banks is likely to relieve anxiety on the Spanish economy \u2014 which is five times larger than Greece's \u2014 and on markets concerned about the country's ability to pay its way.<\/p><p>Spain's financial problems are not due to Greek-style government over-spending. The country's banks particularly its savings banks or \"cajas,\" got caught up in the collapse of a real estate bubble in 2008 that got worse over the past four years. However, as Spain's leaders have struggled for a solution to their banking crisis, the country's borrowing costs have soared close to the level that forced the governments of Greece, Portugal and Ireland to seek rescues.<\/p><p>Some of Spain's banks are struggling with by toxic real estate loans and assets amid fears the problem will get worse as more jobless people can't pay their mortgages. The Bank of Spain says the toxic loans and assets total around \u20ac180 billion. Nationalized lender Bankia SA, which has requested \u20ac19 billion in aid, has \u20ac32 billion in toxic assets. Around four other banks serving the domestic market are considered prime candidates for bailouts.<\/p><p>\"I could never get my mind round the scale of consumption in Spain over the past 20 years, having known it in the 1960s when it was still extremely poor,\" said Paul Preston, a history professor and expert on Spain with the London School of Economics. \"Lots of people enjoyed the consumer boom, but not everybody. Now everybody's having to pay for it.\"<\/p><p>Rajoy blamed Spain's woes on the previous Socialist administration of Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero without mentioning him or his government by name. Zapatero was ousted by Rajoy in a landslide last November by voters outraged over the Socialist handling of the economy.<\/p><p>\"Last year Spain's public administration spent \u20ac90 billion more than it took in, this can't be maintained, we can't live like that,\" Rajoy said.<\/p><p>But Socialist Party leader Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba said Rajoy should acknowledge that Spain is now in bailout territory.<\/p><p>\"The government is trying to make us believe that we've won the lottery, that the Three Kings of Orient have arrived, and that isn't so,\" Rubalcaba said.<\/p><p>After his press conference, Rajoy defended his decision to jet off an hour later to Poland to see Spain's famed national football team take on Italy in the Euro 2012 competition. He said he would be on the ground in Gdansk only for the game before flying back to Madrid Sunday night.<\/p><p>\"I'll be there two and a half hours and then I'll leave,\" Rajoy said. \"I think the national team deserves it.\"","480":"While living in an apartment in Pentagon City, Stephanie Gimenez Stahlberg and her husband, Patrick Stahlberg, a software engineer, began searching for a house where they could raise their family.<\/p><p>With two children \u2014 now 31\/2 and 1 1\/2 \u2014 the Stahlbergs needed more space, including a study area for Stephanie, who is enrolled in a PhD program at the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies.<\/p><p>The house they found in Cherrydale, a neighborhood in North Arlington, met their expectations. Within two days on the market, however, there were 10 offers. \"Our was not the highest,\" Stephanie said. \"We wrote a letter to the owners about why we liked the house.\"<\/p><p>The letter, along with a photograph of the family, worked. What drew the Stahlbergs to the house were the solar panels and the trees and bushes \u2014 raspberries, blueberries, blackberries, strawberries, grapes, apples, plums and currants \u2014 growing organically on the property. The Stahlbergs also envisioned finishing the basement bedroom and bathroom for an au pair.<\/p><p>They also fell in love with the neighborhood. They would be within walking distance to a park and two libraries with story time for children.<\/p><p>\"We were trying to look at homes where we can walk to the Metro, or bike to the city or to the Metro,\" said Stephanie, 27.<\/p><p>Sears and Montgomery Ward kit houses: Cherrydale, once abundant with cherry orchards, is a family neighborhood dating to 1893. While many neighbors have lived in the area for as long as 60 years, newcomers move in and out these days, said Kathryn Holt Springston, who worked for the Smithsonian American History Tours Office as an educational specialist and historian for 28 years. She also served as curator and director of the Arlington Historical Museum and editor of the Cherrydale Citizens' Association newsletter.<\/p><p>Single-family homes, the Arlington public schools, access to bike trails and proximity to the District draw people to the neighborhood. Sometimes, though, they move in but stay only a few years. Finding a house in Cherrydale can involve the competitive process the Stahlbergs experienced.<\/p><p>About half a mile north of the Virginia Square and Ballston Metro stations on the Orange and Silver lines, Cherrydale has a variety of residences ranging from farmhouses to bungalows to Sears and Montgomery Ward kit homes with two to five or bedrooms or sometimes more. Many date from 1900 to 1930, though some of the older houses were purchased to be torn down and replaced with larger homes, including some built as recently as this year.<\/p><p>Living there: Cherrydale lies north of Interstate 66 and south of Lorcom Lane, stretching roughly from Utah Street on the west to the northward-curving interstate on the east. The Maywood neighborhood claims the eastern half of those boundaries north of Lee Highway, lending something of an arrowhead shape to Cherrydale. Since 1908, the Cherrydale Citizens' Association has planned activities and resolved neighborhood concerns. In the 1970s and 1980s, people often referred to the neighborhood as Mayberry, according to Springston, 63. In 1948, her parents bought the house where she lives with her husband and son. It dates to 1890, Springston said.<\/p><p>In the neighborhood, 49 properties sold in the past year, according to Billy Buck, an associate broker at Buck & Associates. The lowest priced was a one-bedroom, one-bath condominium for $200,000; the highest priced was a five-bedroom, five-bath farmhouse at $1.63 million. Twelve properties are on the market now, ranging from a one-bedroom, two-bath condo for $274,900 to a new five-bedroom, five-bath Craftsman house at $1.799 million.<\/p><p>Welcome wagon: The five-points intersection \u2014 Lee Highway, Old Dominion Drive, Quincy Street, Military Road and Quebec Street \u2014 is dotted with at least two car dealerships and other commercial establishments while nearby is a Safeway and the Cherrydale Hardware, which opened in 1938.<\/p><p>The Cherrydale Volunteer Fire House, built in 1919, is home to such events as the annual spaghetti dinner, concerts and for 90 years each December there is a visit from Santa Claus for children under 12. Other community events are the annual Fourth of July party and picnic at 21st and Stafford streets. A neighborhood with its own \"welcome wagon,\" Cherrydale has approximately 1,400 households and three parks as well as the Martha Custis Trail for biking, running and walking.<\/p><p>Schools: Glebe Elementary, Taylor Elementary, Swanson Middle, Kenmore Middle and Washington-Lee High.<\/p><p>Transit: The neighborhood is close to the Virginia Square or Ballston Metro stops on the Orange and Silver lines. Metro and Arlington Transit buses connect at Ballston and Virginia Square. Capital Bikeshare also is available.<\/p><p>Crime: From July 2014 through June 2015, according to Arlington County police, one robbery and two burglaries were reported in the area.<\/p><p>Harriet Edleson is a freelance writer.","481":"Termed a \"man of enough words\" recently by Jim Harbaugh, 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick needed just three syllables Sunday to explain why wide receiver Michael Crabtree has emerged as his favorite target.<\/p><p>In San Francisco's past three games, Crabtree has been targeted 34 times, 20 more than wide receiver Randy Moss, who is second in targets over that span. Tight end Vernon Davis? He has eight targets in the past three games.<\/p><p>It's hard to argue with Kaepernick's pecking order, given the results.<\/p><p>In a 41-34 win over the Patriots on Sunday, Crabtree (7 catches, 107 yards, 2 TDs) was featured on the 49ers' first possession - a tone-setting 63-yard touchdown march - with drive-opening catches of 11 and 13 yards. Kaepernick also threw his final pass to Crabtree, a 38-yard game-winner on a play that wasn't designed for San Francisco's No. 1 wide receiver.<\/p><p>In his past three games, Crabtree has 23 catches for 301 yards and two touchdowns with 90-plus receiving yards in each game. Prior to his streak, he had 90-plus receiving yards in five of the first 53 games of his four-year career.<\/p><p>In his five starts, Kaepernick has a 113.6 rating when targeting Crabtree, who has helped earn his confidence with reliable hands. According to Pro Football Focus, Crabtree has three drops in Kaepernick's starts, an impressive figure given the heat the Howitzer-armed quarterback puts on his throws.<\/p><p>On KNBR Tuesday, Harbaugh, who famously declared in the offseason Crabtree had the best hands he'd ever seen, crowed a bit when asked if there was a special Kaepernick-Crabtree chemistry.<\/p><p>\"Yeah, I think there is,\" Harbaugh said. \"But Michael has been doing this all year now. Talked about it every week, the ability to catch, nobody catches the ball better than Michael Crabtree. I think back to last summer when we were talking about the same topic. It might have even been on this show. A lot of people 'What? The greatest hands you've ever seen?' Nobody mentions that any more. Boy, the evidence sure is there.\"<\/p><p>With at least 10 catches and 132 yards over the final two regular-season games, Crabtree (73 catches, 868 yards) would become the 49ers' first 1,000-yard receiver since Terrell Owens in 2003 and will have the most receptions since Owens hauled in 100 in 2002.<\/p><p>Davis, who had team-highs in targets (eight), receptions (six) and yards (83) in Kaepernick's first start against Chicago last month, has since become an afterthought. He had one catch for 10 yards against the Patriots, and four catches, 29 yards and nine targets over the last four games.<\/p><p>Davis said he's yet to establish a chemistry with Kaepernick that matches the connection he had with former starter Alex Smith.<\/p><p>\"You have to develop that chemistry, that bond so you can be on the same page,\" Davis said. \"That's something me and Kaep don't have right now. We don't have it. You have to expect it because he just stepped in. Me and Alex, we've been here.\"<\/p><p>Asked why Crabtree has been quick to get on the same page, Davis said the red-hot wide receiver has been running shorter routes. However, he also noted, as Kaepernick did Sunday night, that Crabtree has earned his targets by breaking free from coverage.<\/p><p>\"Crab is a pretty good route runner,\" Davis said. \"He's getting open and Kaep is finding him.\"<\/p><p>Eric Branch is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.

Scared of what people will think, scared it makes me look weak or unprofessional,\" she writes.<\/p><p>\"When friends or comics ask why we broke up, it's not easy or comfortable to reply; it doesn't seem like the appropriate thing to say at a stand-up show, a party or a wedding. It's embarrassing. I feel stupid. After being verbally, physically abused and raped, I dated him for two more months. It's not simple.\"<\/p><p>Ultimately, Stelling couldn't exclude such a significant piece of her story from her onstage persona, even if it meant risking ridicule from the close-knit comedy community.<\/p><p>\"After I broke up with him, he said, 'You're very open and honest in your stand-up, and I just ask that you consider me when you talk about your ex because everyone knows who you're talking about.' And I abided. I wrote vague jokes because we both live in L.A., and I didn't want to hurt him, start a war, press charges, be interrogated or harassed by him or his friends and family. I wanted to move on and forget because I didn't understand,\" Stelling shares.<\/p><p>\"I don't want revenge or to hurt him now, but it's unhealthy to keep this inside because my stand-up is pulled directly from my life. It's how I make my living. My personal is my professional. That is how I've always been; I make dark, funny.

According to Pro Football Focus, Crabtree has three drops in Kaepernick's starts, an impressive figure given the heat the Howitzer-armed quarterback puts on his throws.<\/p><p>On KNBR Tuesday, Harbaugh, who famously declared in the offseason Crabtree had the best hands he'd ever seen, crowed a bit when asked if there was a special Kaepernick-Crabtree chemistry.<\/p><p>\"Yeah, I think there is,\" Harbaugh said. \"But Michael has been doing this all year now. Talked about it every week, the ability to catch, nobody catches the ball better than Michael Crabtree. I think back to last summer when we were talking about the same topic. It might have even been on this show. A lot of people 'What? The greatest hands you've ever seen?' Nobody mentions that any more. Boy, the evidence sure is there.\"<\/p><p>With at least 10 catches and 132 yards over the final two regular-season games, Crabtree (73 catches, 868 yards) would become the 49ers' first 1,000-yard receiver since Terrell Owens in 2003 and will have the most receptions since Owens hauled in 100 in 2002.<\/p><p>Davis, who had team-highs in targets (eight), receptions (six) and yards (83) in Kaepernick's first start against Chicago last month, has since become an afterthought. He had one catch for 10 yards against the Patriots, and four catches, 29 yards and nine targets over the last four games.<\/p><p>Davis said he's yet to establish a chemistry with Kaepernick that matches the connection he had with former starter Alex Smith.<\/p><p>\"You have to develop that chemistry, that bond so you can be on the same page,\" Davis said. \"That's something me and Kaep don't have right now. We don't have it. You have to expect it because he just stepped in. Me and Alex, we've been here.\"<\/p><p>Asked why Crabtree has been quick to get on the same page, Davis said the red-hot wide receiver has been running shorter routes. However, he also noted, as Kaepernick did Sunday night, that Crabtree has earned his targets by breaking free from coverage.<\/p><p>\"Crab is a pretty good route runner,\" Davis said. \"He's getting open and Kaep is finding him.\"<\/p><p>Eric Branch is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.

When the shoebox-shaped and nearly shoebox-size panini shop opened on Bedford Street 15 years ago, there was nothing quite like it in New York, a restaurant that kept things simple and kept prices low, serving flavorful food in a room that was just adorable enough that you could decide, midmeal, that maybe the two of you squeezed into the counter were there on a date, and not just grabbing a bite.<\/p><p>You have to fire up the Wayback Machine to better understand how 'ino helped change how this city eats. Fifteen years ago, New York was a bistro town. There was the old guard: Blue Ribbon, Le Gamin, Jules, Lucky Strike, Raoul's and a dozen others. Then in 1997, a newcomer opened in SoHo named Balthazar, which raised the stakes with its set direction and unlisted reservation line. Balthazar was white-hot: it had perfectly distressed mirrors, fresh and crusty bread, and although it was impossible to get a table unless you knew somebody who knew somebody, you could always go at midnight and eat at the bar.<\/p><p>Soon, New York was lousy with bistros. It was a good era if you wanted a kir, steak frites, escargot, fris\u00e9e lardon, profiteroles. Authenticity, or some version of it, was the point. Everybody was pressing butter into little ramekins to be served at room temperature, changing the paper covering the tablecloths before serving dessert.<\/p><p>Honestly, it was really fun. The restaurants were lively, intimate, sexy. So what if you could recite the menu before you set foot in the door? But if you were a young chef with a measure of vision and creativity, you were stuck either making onion soup and beet salad with goat cheese. Or you worked on the line executing the vision and creativity of an older chef in Midtown or TriBeCa. Prune hadn't yet opened. Neither had Diner. Brooklyn didn't have much of a food scene outside the restaurant row on Smith Street, which was anchored by Patois, a bistro. If you went to Williamsburg, it was to go to a party or to go dancing, not to eat. This was the landscape when Jason and Jennifer Denton opened 'ino on a quiet street in the West Village. The kitchen in the back was the size of a D.J. booth and used the technology of induction burners, which was novel at the time: it was a paninoteca that looked as if it belonged in New York rather than being shipped, tile by mirrored tile, from Milan.<\/p><p>The culinary vocabulary was Italian, but it wasn't sepia-toned and sentimental. Instead, there was a focus on ingredients at a time when, in New York at least, few people cared. It had simple food done well, and sometimes you encountered flavors that weren't lifted out of the songbook. I still have a 13-year-old memory of sharing a shredded duck sandwich with sweet relish, a combination that is about as authentically Italian as a functioning parliament. You could go to 'ino to get something familiar (prosciutto and cheese will never get old), but you could also try something new.<\/p><p>'Ino was a casual joint with integrity, an easygoing place where you could eat well as long as you didn't mind the wait. Today, we take this combination for granted, and expect all kitchens to put some effort into sourcing and display a little creativity no matter how limited the resources. That we do owes a little bit to 'ino.","486":"While living in an apartment in Pentagon City, Stephanie Gimenez Stahlberg and her husband, Patrick Stahlberg, a software engineer, began searching for a house where they could raise their family.<\/p><p>With two children \u2014 now 31\/2 and 1 1\/2 \u2014 the Stahlbergs needed more space, including a study area for Stephanie, who is enrolled in a PhD program at the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies.<\/p><p>The house they found in Cherrydale, a neighborhood in North Arlington, met their expectations. Within two days on the market, however, there were 10 offers. \"Our was not the highest,\" Stephanie said. \"We wrote a letter to the owners about why we liked the house.\"<\/p><p>The letter, along with a photograph of the family, worked. What drew the Stahlbergs to the house were the solar panels and the trees and bushes \u2014 raspberries, blueberries, blackberries, strawberries, grapes, apples, plums and currants \u2014 growing organically on the property. The Stahlbergs also envisioned finishing the basement bedroom and bathroom for an au pair.<\/p><p>They also fell in love with the neighborhood. They would be within walking distance to a park and two libraries with story time for children.<\/p><p>\"We were trying to look at homes where we can walk to the Metro, or bike to the city or to the Metro,\" said Stephanie, 27.<\/p><p>Sears and Montgomery Ward kit houses: Cherrydale, once abundant with cherry orchards, is a family neighborhood dating to 1893. While many neighbors have lived in the area for as long as 60 years, newcomers move in and out these days, said Kathryn Holt Springston, who worked for the Smithsonian American History Tours Office as an educational specialist and historian for 28 years. She also served as curator and director of the Arlington Historical Museum and editor of the Cherrydale Citizens' Association newsletter.<\/p><p>Single-family homes, the Arlington public schools, access to bike trails and proximity to the District draw people to the neighborhood. Sometimes, though, they move in but stay only a few years. Finding a house in Cherrydale can involve the competitive process the Stahlbergs experienced.<\/p><p>About half a mile north of the Virginia Square and Ballston Metro stations on the Orange and Silver lines, Cherrydale has a variety of residences ranging from farmhouses to bungalows to Sears and Montgomery Ward kit homes with two to five or bedrooms or sometimes more. Many date from 1900 to 1930, though some of the older houses were purchased to be torn down and replaced with larger homes, including some built as recently as this year.<\/p><p>Living there: Cherrydale lies north of Interstate 66 and south of Lorcom Lane, stretching roughly from Utah Street on the west to the northward-curving interstate on the east. The Maywood neighborhood claims the eastern half of those boundaries north of Lee Highway, lending something of an arrowhead shape to Cherrydale. Since 1908, the Cherrydale Citizens' Association has planned activities and resolved neighborhood concerns. In the 1970s and 1980s, people often referred to the neighborhood as Mayberry, according to Springston, 63. In 1948, her parents bought the house where she lives with her husband and son. It dates to 1890, Springston said.<\/p><p>In the neighborhood, 49 properties sold in the past year, according to Billy Buck, an associate broker at Buck & Associates. The lowest priced was a one-bedroom, one-bath condominium for $200,000; the highest priced was a five-bedroom, five-bath farmhouse at $1.63 million. Twelve properties are on the market now, ranging from a one-bedroom, two-bath condo for $274,900 to a new five-bedroom, five-bath Craftsman house at $1.799 million.<\/p><p>Welcome wagon: The five-points intersection \u2014 Lee Highway, Old Dominion Drive, Quincy Street, Military Road and Quebec Street \u2014 is dotted with at least two car dealerships and other commercial establishments while nearby is a Safeway and the Cherrydale Hardware, which opened in 1938.<\/p><p>The Cherrydale Volunteer Fire House, built in 1919, is home to such events as the annual spaghetti dinner, concerts and for 90 years each December there is a visit from Santa Claus for children under 12. Other community events are the annual Fourth of July party and picnic at 21st and Stafford streets. A neighborhood with its own \"welcome wagon,\" Cherrydale has approximately 1,400 households and three parks as well as the Martha Custis Trail for biking, running and walking.<\/p><p>Schools: Glebe Elementary, Taylor Elementary, Swanson Middle, Kenmore Middle and Washington-Lee High.<\/p><p>Transit: The neighborhood is close to the Virginia Square or Ballston Metro stops on the Orange and Silver lines. Metro and Arlington Transit buses connect at Ballston and Virginia Square. Capital Bikeshare also is available.<\/p><p>Crime: From July 2014 through June 2015, according to Arlington County police, one robbery and two burglaries were reported in the area.<\/p><p>Harriet Edleson is a freelance writer.","487":"Here are top moments from the House Select Committee hearing on Benghazi where former secretary of state Hillary Clinton testified. (Sarah Parnass\/The Washington Post)<\/p><p>The House Select Committee on Blumenthal, as some are now calling it, came to order at 10 a.m. Lawmakers didn't finish questioning Hillary Clinton until 11 hours later \u2014 just after the Democratic presidential candidate succumbed to a coughing fit.<\/p><p>In that period of time, the name of Sidney Blumenthal was invoked more than 75 times, and scores of questions were asked about the longtime Clinton friend. By lunchtime, Blumenthal had been invoked 49 times \u2014 exactly the number of mentions of J. Christopher Stevens, the ambassador to Libya whose death in Benghazi is the supposed subject of the congressional probe. The other three Americans slain in Benghazi \u2014 Sean Smith, Glen Doherty, Tyrone Woods \u2014 got seven or eight mentions apiece, then-CIA director David Petraeus and former defense secretary Robert Gates each got two, and then-Defense Secretary Leon Panetta had none.<\/p><p>Dana Milbank writes about political theater in the nation's capital. He joined the Post as a political reporter in 2000.<\/p><p>Chairman Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.), reading from Blumenthal's e-mails to Clinton as if he were the teacher who had intercepted a note passed between two high school kids, said Blumenthal referred to Gates as \"a mean, vicious little\"\u2014 Gowdy paused. \"I'm not going to say the word, but he did.\"<\/p><p>He also quoted Blumenthal referring to then- national security adviser Thomas E. Donilon's \"babbling rhetoric,\" and he said Blumenthal had referred to \"Obama\" (he \"left the 'president' part out\") and \"his political cronies in the White House and Chicago.\"<\/p><p>Clinton refused to get riled. \"I don't know what this line of questioning does to help us get to the bottom of deaths of four Americans,\" she said.<\/p><p>But Gowdy knew. A couple of minutes later, he announced: \"I'll tell you what: If you think you've heard about Sidney Blumenthal so far, wait until the next round.\"<\/p><p>He and his colleagues made good on that statement, posing questions on a Blumenthal visit to Clinton's home, about his work for the Clinton Foundation, his business interests, his attempt to get a job at the State Department and his communication with the former secretary of state over matters as mundane as her new iPad. They were particularly concerned with whether Blumenthal's advice to Clinton on Libya was \"unsolicited.\"<\/p><p>The Blumenthal focus shows that, after 17 months of probing Clinton, the Benghazi committee hasn't come up with much. Blumenthal has been a Clinton hatchet man for years, and he has an unsavory reputation. The very mention of his name (he was prominent during the Monica Lewinsky scandal) lends a whiff of skulduggery to any situation.<\/p><p>But injecting Blumenthal as a central character in the Benghazi probe doesn't help Republicans demonstrate that Clinton did wrong. And the justification for invoking him \u2014 to demonstrate that Clinton had more contact with him than with Stevens \u2014 is a stretch. Whatever else one thinks of the former journalist \u2014 I've clashed with him over the years \u2014 he had nothing to do with what happened in Libya on Sept. 11 and 12, 2012.<\/p><p>Rep. Mike Pompeo (R-Kan.) acted as if he had found a video of Blumenthal attacking the compound himself. Pompeo, who had previously made the false allegation that Clinton got \"most of her intelligence\" on Libya from Blumenthal, asked whether Stevens had Clinton's personal e-mail, her cellphone number, fax or home address or visited her at home. \"Mr. Blumenthal had each of those and did each of those things,\" Pompeo concluded.<\/p><p>Rep. Peter J. Roskam (R-Ill.) thought he saw a smoking gun in an e-mail correspondence from August 2011 in which Blumenthal encouraged Clinton to \"make a public statement before the cameras\" when Libyan leader Moammar Gaddafi was deposed.<\/p><p>\"Two months before the end of the Gaddafi regime and you're already planning on how to make your statement dramatic to maximize political gain,\" Roskam scolded.<\/p><p>Relevance to the Benghazi attack? None.<\/p><p>Gowdy, for his part, found it damning that Clinton aides passed along some of Blumenthal's advice (which he got from a former intelligence official) to people including Stevens. \"It's relevant because our ambassador was asked to read and respond to Sidney Blumenthal's drivel,\" the chairman said, \"in some instances on the very same day he was asking for security.\"<\/p><p>Rep. Adam B. Schiff (Calif.), a Democrat, observed that for all the time the panel has spent on Blumenthal, you'd think \"that he was in Benghazi on the night, manning the barricades.\" During private testimony from Blumenthal, to which he was summoned by federal marshals, Republicans asked more than 160 questions about Blumenthal's associations with Bill and Hillary Clinton but fewer than 20 about the Benghazi attacks.<\/p><p>Schiff and Rep. Elijah E. Cummings (Md.), the ranking Democrat, proposed that Republicans, rather than selectively releasing Blumenthal's e-mails, come clean about their interest in him and make public the entire transcript of his testimony. Gowdy, after a shouting match with Cummings, refused.<\/p><p>Read more from Dana Milbank's archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.","488":"Jim Herron Zamora, Chronicle Staff Writer<\/p><p>Larry and Muriel fight back tears as they leave the courthouse after hearing that their son Darren Ray was found the guilty of killing Terrance Kelly, Wednesday Oct. 11, 2006, in Martinez, Ca.

Fewer voters than expected turned out.<\/p><p>Editor's note: John Avlon is a CNN contributor and senior political columnist for Newsweek and The Daily Beast. He is co-editor of the book \"Deadline Artists: America's Greatest Newspaper Columns.\"<\/p><p>(CNN) -- Beneath Rick Santorum's stunning three-state sweep on Tuesday stands another stubborn sign of dissatisfaction with the status quo: Republican turnout is down.<\/p><p>I'm talking embarrassingly, disturbingly, hey-don't-you-know-it's-an-election-year bad. It is a sign of a serious enthusiasm gap among the rank and file, and a particularly bad omen for Mitt Romney and the GOP in the general election.<\/p><p>Here's the tale of the tape, state by state, beginning with Tuesday night: Minnesota had just more than 47,000 people turn out for its caucuses this year -- four years ago it was nearly 63,000 -- and Romney came in first, not a distant third as he did Tuesday night. In Colorado, more than 70,000 people turned out for its caucus in 2008 -- but in 2012 it was 65,000. And Missouri -- even making a generous discount for the fact that this was an entirely symbolic contest -- had 232,000 people turn out, less than half the number who did four years ago.<\/p><p>Even with months of pre-primary hype and attention solely devoted to the Republican field, turnout in this election cycle essentially flat-lined. In Iowa, a little more than 121,000 people voted, compared with nearly 119,000 four years before, when action in the Democratic caucuses absorbed most of the attention.<\/p><p>In New Hampshire, the same dynamic applied -- 245,000 voters turned out in 2012, compared with 241,000 four years before, despite Republicans being the only game in town and independents making up 47% of the total turnout in 2012, according to CNN exit polls. Take out the independent voters and you've got a deep net decline.<\/p><p>Always proudly rebellious, South Carolina has been the great outlier in this election cycle. With Newt Gingrich making an all-out push for conservatives in a conservative state, turnout was up almost 150,000 over four years before.<\/p><p>But in Florida, the decline became unmistakable. Maybe it decreased because the Romney and Gingrich campaigns, plus super PACS, spent more than $18 million in the Sunshine State on TV ads, of which 93% were negative in the last week alone, according to the Campaign Media Analysis Group. After all, negative ads depress turnout. But after all the mud was thrown, 1.6 million people turned out in the nation's fourth largest state, which might sound impressive until you compare it with the nearly 2 million who turned out in 2008.<\/p><p>Nevada was even worse, with 32,894 people turning out to vote in a state with more than 465,000 registered Republicans. Four years before, more than 44,300 participated in the caucus. Turnout was down more than 25% despite the GOP caucuses being the only game in town. Party officials were expecting a turnout of more than 70,000.<\/p><p>All this should be a wake-up call for the GOP. Despite an enormous amount of national media attention devoted to each of the states to date, the response has been a notable yawn among the Republican rank and file.<\/p><p>The turnout numbers are even worse when you compare them with the number of registered Republicans in each state that has voted to date.<\/p><p>The caucuses in particular bring out an unrepresentative sample of a state's Republican Party. For all the grass-roots romanticism, there has got to be a better way to pick a presidential nominee.<\/p><p>But the news is worst for Romney, long the presumptive front-runner in a party that tends to reward the man next in line.<\/p><p>\"Reluctantly Romney\" could be a bumper sticker, even for his supporters. The former Massachusetts governor has found it difficult to climb above 35% in national polls, meaning that a majority of Republicans still support someone else in a notably weak field. His vote margins and totals lag behind those of four years before, when he lost the nomination to John McCain in a crowded and comparatively competent field, although Minnesota is the first state he won in '08 and lost in 2012.<\/p><p>You reap what you sow, and part of the reason turnout is down is directly related to the problem of polarization. The Republican Party is more ideologically polarized than at any time in recent history. Therefore, it put up more purely right-wing candidates than it did four years before, when center-right leaders such as McCain and Rudy Giuliani were also in the race. A bigger tent inspired bigger turnout.<\/p><p>But the other reason is simple dissatisfaction with the candidates.<\/p><p>Republicans seem united in their anger against the president -- like the Democrats in 2004 -- but they are uninspired by their options. Draft movements for fantasy candidates ranging from Chris Christie to Mitch Daniels to Paul Ryan and even Jeb Bush have started and failed. Some party leaders show more enthusiasm for a hypothetical 2016 crop of candidates, including Marco Rubio and Bobby Jindal, than they do for the flawed choices before them in this election. Divided and dispirited is an odd place for the Republican Party to be so soon after the enthusiasms of the 2010 tea party-driven election.<\/p><p>The bottom line is that voter turnout matters. And what should be most troubling for Republicans is that this enthusiasm gap among the conservative base is accompanied by a lack of candidates who might appeal to independents and centrist swing voters in the general election. It is a double barrel of bad news for the Republican Party. The numbers can be spun and rationalized by professional partisan operatives all day long, but the fact remains -- voters just aren't turning out to cast their votes for this crop of conservative candidates in 2012.<\/p><p>Follow CNN Opinion on Twitter.<\/p><p>Join the conversation on Facebook.<\/p><p>The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John Avlon.","491":"The Coworking Resources Series is supported by join.me.

It's been nearly two decades since pictures of this sort were produced with any regularity by the studio system, and a lot longer since they were stateside successes. Many of the attempts in recent years have been, at best, mid-budget passion projects with circumscribed audiences (Stallone's own<\/p><p>which topped out at $42 million domestically) or post-modern winks (the French-language \"JCVD\" from 2008, a hostage movie in which Jean-Claude Van Damme plays a version of himself). The few large-scale attempts, like \"The A-Team,\" underperformed. (The biceps-and-bullets remake grossed $77 million domestically, a number that will likely be easily surpassed by \"The Expendables.\")<\/p><p>But the Stallone picture -- with its hard-charging, take-no-prisoners patriotism unbothered by the vagaries of the real world (it takes place in a fictional country, for starters) and its caricature of freedom-hating enemies (\"We will kill this American disease,\" as the TV spot enticed us) -- planted itself squarely in the old-school genre. And this weekend, the movie showed that there's life in that category yet. That \"Scott Pilgrim vs. the World,\" the tongue-in-cheek, pop-culture-referential, decidedly 2010 creation -- the one for, of and by arch fanboys -- trailed well behind \"The Expendables\" only drove home the point more loudly.<\/p><p>On one hand, it's understandable that a movie of easy American heroism (OK, first-world Western heroism) would catch on. In fact, it's surprising it didn't happen sooner. Apple-pie-patriotism already is behind the success of a cable news network and supports large sections of the contemporary country music industry. Why not a film hit too?<\/p><p>But among all the factors to which one might point in explaining the success of \"The Expendables\" -- a cast harvested from so many demographics and eras; a moviegoer backlash to 3-D and CG effects -- it somehow doesn't feel that the demand for neat heroes and villains is one of them.<\/p><p>Norris and his ilk would submit that in our current period of ideological and geopolitical upheaval, in a time of blurry lines between enemies and friends in places such as Afghanistan and Iraq, that black-and-white heroes slake a patriotic thirst (and that, indeed, the movie-going world can support a lot more of them). But history argues the opposite: Those movies succeed when the culture at large is filled with clear-cut distinctions. On the other hand, when the zeitgeist is more cloudy, an entirely different kind of cinema prospers.<\/p><p>The post-WWII era and its mainly straightforward distinctions between good and evil, to take an example of the former, yielded a flowering subgenre of movies with morally uncomplicated gunslingers. And 30 years later, the ideological simplicity of the Cold War and its larger-than-life Evil Empire gave rise to the very action movies on which \"Expendables\" is modeled (not to mention the ultimate in us-versus-them confections, \"Rocky IV.\" Yes, there's a Stallone-ishness to all of this). There are plenty of reasons why these types of movies faded from view in the 1990s, but the fall of the Berlin Wall and the the Soviet Union certainly played a part.<\/p><p>The examples are just as abundant on the other side. The ambiguities of the Vietnam War and the counterculture in the late 1960s and early 1970s undoubtedly offered up the moral murkiness of<\/p><p>\"Midnight Cowboy\" and scores of others. In the post-9\/11 world, meanwhile, movies like<\/p><p>-- with its themes of a destruction-bent enemy that can't be bargained with, and the question of what constitutes an acceptable ethical compromise in fighting that enemy -- have captured our imagination. You can throw<\/p><p>in there too, to the degree the movie was a contemplation of Western interests in the Middle East.<\/p><p>Political eras are, of course, rarely just one thing or another, and the movies we want to see in a given period are hardly monolithic. But as tempting as it is to infer that the success of \"The Expendables\" shows a deeper cultural need, it may well be the wrong inference. When times are confusing, we want movies to reflect that confusion, and even to make sense of it. But we probably don't want to pretend that confusion doesn't exist.<\/p><p>Photo: A scene from \"The Expendables.\" Credit: Lionsgate<\/p><p>Stallone: I'm contemplating an \"Expendables\" sequel<\/p><p>Hollywood wonders if Schwarzenegger will be back","493":"12\/28\/2015 AT 04:50 PM EST<\/p><p>Like a lot of professional funny people, Beth Stelling is used to getting candid about her life offstage. Recently, the Los Angeles based-comedian started working one very personal, serious experience into her routine.<\/p><p>on Monday to open up about a violent relationship with an ex boyfriend, sharing photos of her bruised arms and legs and explaining why she has decided to include discussions of the abuse in her stand-up.<\/p><p>\"Same girl in all of these photos (me). I've had an amazing year, and you've seen the highlights here, so these photos are an uncommon thing to share but not an uncommon issue,\" Stelling captions a collage of photos of her bruises and her onstage smile.<\/p><p>The comic, who released her album<\/p><p>this fall and has a Comedy Central special, was hesitant to openly talk about the abuse, especially within her professional world.<\/p><p>\"There are many reasons not to make an abusive relationship public, mostly fear. Scared of what people will think, scared it makes me look weak or unprofessional,\" she writes.<\/p><p>\"When friends or comics ask why we broke up, it's not easy or comfortable to reply; it doesn't seem like the appropriate thing to say at a stand-up show, a party or a wedding. It's embarrassing. I feel stupid. After being verbally, physically abused and raped, I dated him for two more months. It's not simple.\"<\/p><p>Ultimately, Stelling couldn't exclude such a significant piece of her story from her onstage persona, even if it meant risking ridicule from the close-knit comedy community.<\/p><p>\"After I broke up with him, he said, 'You're very open and honest in your stand-up, and I just ask that you consider me when you talk about your ex because everyone knows who you're talking about.' And I abided. I wrote vague jokes because we both live in L.A., and I didn't want to hurt him, start a war, press charges, be interrogated or harassed by him or his friends and family. I wanted to move on and forget because I didn't understand,\" Stelling shares.<\/p><p>\"I don't want revenge or to hurt him now, but it's unhealthy to keep this inside because my stand-up is pulled directly from my life. It's how I make my living. My personal is my professional. That is how I've always been; I make dark, funny. So now I'm allowing this to be part of my story.\"<\/p><p>Stelling says she's already started joking about the relationship and asked her followers to \"have the courage to listen and accept.\"<\/p><p>So far, the funny lady has been getting a positive response to her openness at the mic.<\/p><p>\"Already since talking about this onstage, many women have come to me after shows asking me to keep doing it,\" she says on Instagram. \"Men have shown their solidarity.\"","494":"The Coworking Resources Series is supported by join.me.

Blacksberg, boboroshi, steveyb","495":"Disunion follows the Civil War as it unfolded.<\/p><p>The Lincoln administration may not have gone to war in 1861 to end slavery, but no one bothered to tell that to the slaves. Within six weeks of the firing on Fort Sumter, Gen. Benjamin Butler was forced to decide what to do with three slaves who escaped to Fortress Monroe on the north shore of Virginia's James River. Butler, certainly no abolitionist, nonetheless refused to return the three to their owner, labeling them \"contrabands of war.\"<\/p><p>The term, suitably ambiguous for an administration that as yet had no policy on how to handle the fugitives, found immediate acceptance. As one Union officer wrote, \"Never was a word so speedily adopted by so many people in so short a time.\" Within weeks hundreds of \"contrabands\" \u2014 men, women and children \u2014 flocked to Fortress Monroe and other Union Army positions. Unsure what might greet them, the escaped slaves were yet confident that life under federal control must surely represent an improvement.<\/p><p>It took the federal government more than a year to devise a policy in answer to this thirst for freedom. In August 1861, the First Confiscation Act stripped slaveholders of their claim of ownership, but it failed to clarify whether the slaves were themselves free. The following March Congress prohibited the military from sending escaped slaves back into slavery, and in July the Second Confiscation Act decreed that all slaves that took refuge in Union areas were \"captives of war\" and would be set free.<\/p><p>These legislative actions took on ever greater significance as Union forces moved deeper and deeper into Confederate territory. The growing number of contrabands reaching federal lines necessitated the establishment of dozens of impromptu contraband camps. A draft map compiled by the National Park Service illustrates how the network of these generally transitory camps mirrored the advance of the Union Army along the Mississippi, Tennessee and Cumberland River systems. Grant's Army of the Tennessee spent the summer of 1862 protecting supply lines in western Tennessee and northern Mississippi. Victories at the Battle of Iuka in September and the Battle of Corinth in early October solidified Union control of the area.<\/p><p>Lincoln's announcement of the preliminary Emancipation Proclamation on Sept. 22, 1862, produced an even greater flood of refugees. How best to use and care for these contrabands proved particularly vexing for military leaders under Grant's command. \"You have no idea of the consternation Old Abe's Proclamation is making,\" wrote Gen. Grenville Dodge to his brother in September. The contrabands \"will not even wait until 1st January. I do not know what we shall do with them.\"<\/p><p>Many of these fugitives arrived in an appalling condition. \"There were men, women, and children in every stage of disease or decrepitude often nearly naked, with flesh torn by the terrible experiences of their escape,\" wrote one observer. \"Often the slaves met prejudices against their color more bitter than any they had left behind.\"<\/p><p>On Nov. 11, 1862, Grant took the first step toward addressing the crisis: he named John Eaton, a former high school principal and chaplain of the 27th Ohio Infantry, as superintendent of contrabands and set him at work \"organizing them into suitable companies for working.\" A month later he went further. \"The negroes will be clothed, and in every way provided for, out of their earnings\" \u2014 about 12.5 cents for each pound of cotton picked \u2014 \"so far as practicable,\" he ordered. \"In no case will negroes be forced into the service of the Government, or be enticed away from their homes except when it becomes a military necessity.\"<\/p><p>Grant's policies lent the contraband camps an official status and began to define what a freedman could and could not do once within the Union lines. Personally, Grant appears to have had no particular sympathy for the refugees. He seems to have recognized that, in the words of one observer, \"The soldiers of our army were a good deal opposed to serving the Negro in any manner.\" Nevertheless, the Union commander unreservedly supported Eaton's work and in the process enabled the creation of one of the war's most successful contraband camps, located at Corinth, Miss.<\/p><p>Although formally organized under the direction of General Dodge in early December 1862 and placed under the command of James M. Alexander, chaplain of the 66th Illinois, the Corinth camp likely came into existence as early as September. Initially housed in army tents no longer considered serviceable for Union troops, the freedmen were soon set to work downing trees and clearing land on which to build cabins and lay out streets, which were named for Union generals. Eventually the freedmen also built a four-room school, a commissary, a hospital, a church and an office. The entire camp was divided into wards, complete with ward masters and a police force.<\/p><p>In late 1862 the American Missionary Association sent its first volunteers to Corinth to help care for, educate and minister to the freedmen. In a memoir written years after the war, one such missionary recalled her experience. \"When brought face to face with the slaves,\" she wrote, \"it was like the discovery of a new race.\" The men and women who came to Corinth generally shared a paternalistic optimism and viewed the freedmen as childlike in their enthusiasm for both education and salvation.<\/p><p>The freedmen's thirst for knowledge was undeniable. \"You will find them every hour of daylight, at their books,\" observed the Rev. Edward Pierce in March of 1863. \"We cannot enter a cabin, or tent, but that we see from one to three with books.\" Within no time Pierce and his wife had more than 150 students, and by the end of the summer, the addition of more missionaries enabled the school to accommodate between 300 and 400 children as well as 60 adults at a night school. In August, one of the teachers estimated that as many as 1,000 freedmen had learned to read in the Corinth camp.<\/p><p>Organized religion followed closely on the heels of formal education. Reverend Olds \"saw an earnestness in reference to the Christian life that I have seldom seen. And as I saw their deep earnestness & heard their hearty responses,\" he said, \"I was led to ask where can we find a more impressible people than these?\"<\/p><p>The population of the camp fluctuated between 1,500 and 6,000, as large groups undertook assignments for the Union Army or contracted to work on local plantations. In March 1863, for example, the camp was home to 658 men, 1,440 women and 1,559 children. Among the men were 36 blacksmiths, 48 carpenters, 180 teamsters and 200 cooks. The female ranks included 80 seamstresses, 150 laundresses and 600 cooks. Two-thirds of the men and three-quarters of the women were married, and seven in eight women had children. According to John Eaton's records, the camp had experienced 900 cases of illness, 189 deaths and 45 births.<\/p><p>Life at Corinth changed dramatically after a May 1863 visit by Adj. Gen. Lorenzo Thomas, who was intent on recruiting thousands of contrabands for his newly formed black regiments. With the organization of the 1st Alabama Infantry of African Descent, later renamed the 55th United States Colored Troops, the camp lost most of its able-bodied men.<\/p><p>Their departure to fight left only the women, the young, the old and the infirm to carry on Eaton's ambitious agricultural program, which rested on the cooperative farming of large tracts of abandoned and confiscated land. The program put 400 acres under cultivation, 300 for cotton and 100 for vegetables. Each cabin also had its own subsistence garden. By May 1863, the success of the agricultural program and the presence of a multitude of skilled artisans produced a clear monthly profit of $4,000 to $5,000 for the government, as well as an admirably independent community that Eaton hoped might serve as a model for other camps.<\/p><p>Unfortunately, the success of the Corinth camp proved short-lived. Plans for a winter campaign by Union forces in January 1864 provided a grim reminder that the fate of the freedmen was always secondary to the triumph of the Union cause. The order to relocate the camp's inhabitants 93 miles westward, to Memphis, \"fell like a bomb-shell among our contented people,\" lamented one missionary, \"but military orders are preemptory,\" and they \"must be obeyed.\" The freedmen left their \"well-organized village,\" gardens and farms to tdiv><\/p><p>The move from Corinth destroyed the spirit that had animated the freedmen's success. Some of the new refugees found work on confiscated plantations or in Memphis, but most lived in one of several camps surrounding the city.<\/p><p>\"The destruction of the Corinth camp,\" noted one historian, \"was one of the tragedies of the Civil War.\" Eaton's plan for large-scale cooperative farming fell victim to a bitter struggle between the War and Treasury departments over the leasing of plantations and was never implemented elsewhere. And no more than one or two other camps were able to replicate the strong civilian leadership, well-planned and policed living environment, and emphasis on education that made Corinth a success.<\/p><p>Had the government learned from the model fashioned in northern Mississippi between the fall of 1862 and early 1864, the newly freed slaves might well have enjoyed a far easier transition to life in postwar America.<\/p><p>Sources: Joseph E.

Tight end Vernon Davis? He has eight targets in the past three games.<\/p><p>It's hard to argue with Kaepernick's pecking order, given the results.<\/p><p>In a 41-34 win over the Patriots on Sunday, Crabtree (7 catches, 107 yards, 2 TDs) was featured on the 49ers' first possession - a tone-setting 63-yard touchdown march - with drive-opening catches of 11 and 13 yards. Kaepernick also threw his final pass to Crabtree, a 38-yard game-winner on a play that wasn't designed for San Francisco's No. 1 wide receiver.<\/p><p>In his past three games, Crabtree has 23 catches for 301 yards and two touchdowns with 90-plus receiving yards in each game. Prior to his streak, he had 90-plus receiving yards in five of the first 53 games of his four-year career.<\/p><p>In his five starts, Kaepernick has a 113.6 rating when targeting Crabtree, who has helped earn his confidence with reliable hands. According to Pro Football Focus, Crabtree has three drops in Kaepernick's starts, an impressive figure given the heat the Howitzer-armed quarterback puts on his throws.<\/p><p>On KNBR Tuesday, Harbaugh, who famously declared in the offseason Crabtree had the best hands he'd ever seen, crowed a bit when asked if there was a special Kaepernick-Crabtree chemistry.<\/p><p>\"Yeah, I think there is,\" Harbaugh said. \"But Michael has been doing this all year now. Talked about it every week, the ability to catch, nobody catches the ball better than Michael Crabtree. I think back to last summer when we were talking about the same topic.

Boy, the evidence sure is there.\"<\/p><p>With at least 10 catches and 132 yards over the final two regular-season games, Crabtree (73 catches, 868 yards) would become the 49ers' first 1,000-yard receiver since Terrell Owens in 2003 and will have the most receptions since Owens hauled in 100 in 2002.<\/p><p>Davis, who had team-highs in targets (eight), receptions (six) and yards (83) in Kaepernick's first start against Chicago last month, has since become an afterthought. He had one catch for 10 yards against the Patriots, and four catches, 29 yards and nine targets over the last four games.<\/p><p>Davis said he's yet to establish a chemistry with Kaepernick that matches the connection he had with former starter Alex Smith.<\/p><p>\"You have to develop that chemistry, that bond so you can be on the same page,\" Davis said. \"That's something me and Kaep don't have right now. We don't have it. You have to expect it because he just stepped in. Me and Alex, we've been here.\"<\/p><p>Asked why Crabtree has been quick to get on the same page, Davis said the red-hot wide receiver has been running shorter routes. However, he also noted, as Kaepernick did Sunday night, that Crabtree has earned his targets by breaking free from coverage.<\/p><p>\"Crab is a pretty good route runner,\" Davis said. \"He's getting open and Kaep is finding him.\"<\/p><p>Eric Branch is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.

Beginning with its shot of a Pontiac GTO pulling doughnuts in a high school parking lot to Aerosmith's \"Sweet Emotion,\" \"Dazed\" is such a humane approximation of what it was like to come of age in the mid-1970s that one wishes it would never end. On the evidence of \"Boyhood\" and the \"Before Sunrise\" trilogy, though, Linklater doesn't want any of his movies to end. Thus \"Everybody Wants Some!!\"<\/p><p>Which at first is different, sometimes jarringly so, before wading into the open-armed embrace of experience that marks this filmmaker's finest work. The tipoffs are those double exclamation points and an onscreen title font that recalls a Skinemax late-night movie circa 1981. What if you took one of that era's hormone-drenched stu-coms and put real people in it?<\/p><p>The year is 1980, actually, and Jake (Blake Jenner from \"Glee\") is arriving for his freshman year at (the fictional) Southeastern Texas State University. A high school pitching star and rangy college prospect, he's assigned an off-campus baseball dorm with the other players. It's a ready-made animal house, with rules laid down by a briefly seen coach (Jonathan Breck) that are immediately ignored. Occasionally we'll get an onscreen reminder of how many dwindling days and hours remain before classes begin. These, too, are ignored.<\/p><p>Instead, Linklater parks his cameras to observe, with indulgence and much good humor, the bonding rituals of young men who only think they have it figured out. Jake's housemates fall into general categories that re-sort themselves into individual personalities: The motor-mouthed ladies' man Finnegan (Glen Powell), the Zen surfer-stoner Willoughby (Wyatt Russell), uber-competitive McReynolds (Tyler Hoechlin), country rube Billy (Will Brittain), smartass Nesbit (Austin Amelio), na\u00efve Brumley (Tanner Kalina). And so on.<\/p><p>A few stand slightly outside the pack: the over-confident psycho-nerd pitcher Jay Niles (Juston Street, freakily funny) and the laconic second base star Dale Douglas (J. Quinton Johnson), whose blackness is rarely commented on. Where are the women? There to be chased and partied with and seduced. \"This is college, Jake,\" the hero is told early on. \"The girls can be as big sluts as the guys.\"<\/p><p>Oh, dear. Is \"Everybody Wants Some!!\" what happens when you people an entire Richard Linklater movie with Matthew McConaughey's horndog Wooderson from \"Dazed and Confused\"? Yes and no, or, rather, yes, but only at first. As the boys sprawl through the last days of summer, the swagger that borders on smug begins to mellow and melt away. Searching for good times and girls, they hop from a disco one night to a country and western bar the next to a punk mosh pit to an art-student costume party, minds open, adapting, ever-changing. After a while, the hero starts having a smallish identity crisis, confessing that \"it sort of begs the question of who we are.\"<\/p><p>Well, yes. This is college, Jake. Even a high school sports star can be anyone he wants.<\/p><p>The movie eventually spins him off from the crowd into the arms of Beverly (Zoey Deutch), a tartly ardent stage arts freshman with Joni Mitchell posters on her wall. She's unpretentious for a theater brat, he's smart and soulful for a jock, and the two stand dazzled in the Venn diagram overlap of their attraction. These scenes try a little too hard to be charming but they are anyway, and if Deutch has the freckles and immediacy of a classic Brat Pack heroine, it may be because her mother is Lea Thompson of \"Back to the Future\" and \"Some Kind of Wonderful\" and her father is Howard Deutch, who directed the latter.<\/p><p>More second-generation pleasures: Wyatt Russell, who plays the woolly baseball mystic Willoughby, is the son of Kurt Russell and Goldie Hawn, and he has a high old time \u2014 emphasis on high \u2014 explaining to his teammates why \"Fearless,\" from the 1971 album \"Meddle,\" is the best track that Pink Floyd ever recorded. Because he is correct, I am awarding \"Everybody Wants Some!!\" an extra half-star.<\/p><p>Linklater was a high school baseball player who went to Sam Houston State on a scholarship, and the movie is steeped in the lazy, rivalrous minutiae of college ball. Willoughby gets off a moment of bliss when he muses on the pleasures of pitching \u2014 \"It's lovely out there on the bump,\" he says \u2014 and we learn that it's the .230 hitters who are always the most superstitious. Also that it's possible to slice a pitched baseball in half with an ax. At one point, one of the characters gazes with incredulity at a crowd of fellow students and says, \"I know what we're doing here. We're playing baseball. What are they doing here?\"<\/p><p>\"Everybody Wants Some!!\" is a nice long soak in the Proustian detritus of its era. Beverly drives a Gremlin, Jake knows the secret of winning at \"Space Invaders,\" and people can still confidently begin sentences with the words, \"It's like Carl Sagan says. . .\" What \"Sweet Emotion\" was to \"Dazed and Confused,\" so the Knack's \"My Sharona\" is to this movie, and the soundtrack rolls forward from there: glorious junk from the days when Eddie Rabbitt, Eddie Money, Sniff 'n' the Tears, and the BusBoys meant something.<\/p><p>All that's missing is a plot. But Linklater doesn't do plot; he does life. Says Powell's garrulous Finnegan, summing up the art of both this movie and this moviemaker, \"I don't think at all. I just talk a lot. It's jazz improv. You're invited.\" And so are we.<\/p><p>Written and directed by Richard Linklater. Starring Blake Jenner, Zoey Deutch, Glen Powell, Wyatt Russell, Tyler Hoechlin, Juston Street.

(Sarah Parnass\/The Washington Post)<\/p><p>The House Select Committee on Blumenthal, as some are now calling it, came to order at 10 a.m. Lawmakers didn't finish questioning Hillary Clinton until 11 hours later \u2014 just after the Democratic presidential candidate succumbed to a coughing fit.<\/p><p>In that period of time, the name of Sidney Blumenthal was invoked more than 75 times, and scores of questions were asked about the longtime Clinton friend. By lunchtime, Blumenthal had been invoked 49 times \u2014 exactly the number of mentions of J. Christopher Stevens, the ambassador to Libya whose death in Benghazi is the supposed subject of the congressional probe. The other three Americans slain in Benghazi \u2014 Sean Smith, Glen Doherty, Tyrone Woods \u2014 got seven or eight mentions apiece, then-CIA director David Petraeus and former defense secretary Robert Gates each got two, and then-Defense Secretary Leon Panetta had none.<\/p><p>Dana Milbank writes about political theater in the nation's capital. He joined the Post as a political reporter in 2000.<\/p><p>Chairman Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.), reading from Blumenthal's e-mails to Clinton as if he were the teacher who had intercepted a note passed between two high school kids, said Blumenthal referred to Gates as \"a mean, vicious little\"\u2014 Gowdy paused. \"I'm not going to say the word, but he did.\"<\/p><p>He also quoted Blumenthal referring to then- national security adviser Thomas E. Donilon's \"babbling rhetoric,\" and he said Blumenthal had referred to \"Obama\" (he \"left the 'president' part out\") and \"his political cronies in the White House and Chicago.\"<\/p><p>Clinton refused to get riled. \"I don't know what this line of questioning does to help us get to the bottom of deaths of four Americans,\" she said.<\/p><p>But Gowdy knew. A couple of minutes later, he announced: \"I'll tell you what: If you think you've heard about Sidney Blumenthal so far, wait until the next round.\"<\/p><p>He and his colleagues made good on that statement, posing questions on a Blumenthal visit to Clinton's home, about his work for the Clinton Foundation, his business interests, his attempt to get a job at the State Department and his communication with the former secretary of state over matters as mundane as her new iPad. They were particularly concerned with whether Blumenthal's advice to Clinton on Libya was \"unsolicited.\"<\/p><p>The Blumenthal focus shows that, after 17 months of probing Clinton, the Benghazi committee hasn't come up with much. Blumenthal has been a Clinton hatchet man for years, and he has an unsavory reputation. The very mention of his name (he was prominent during the Monica Lewinsky scandal) lends a whiff of skulduggery to any situation.<\/p><p>But injecting Blumenthal as a central character in the Benghazi probe doesn't help Republicans demonstrate that Clinton did wrong. And the justification for invoking him \u2014 to demonstrate that Clinton had more contact with him than with Stevens \u2014 is a stretch. Whatever else one thinks of the former journalist \u2014 I've clashed with him over the years \u2014 he had nothing to do with what happened in Libya on Sept. 11 and 12, 2012.<\/p><p>Rep. Mike Pompeo (R-Kan.) acted as if he had found a video of Blumenthal attacking the compound himself. Pompeo, who had previously made the false allegation that Clinton got \"most of her intelligence\" on Libya from Blumenthal, asked whether Stevens had Clinton's personal e-mail, her cellphone number, fax or home address or visited her at home. \"Mr. Blumenthal had each of those and did each of those things,\" Pompeo concluded.<\/p><p>Rep. Peter J. Roskam (R-Ill.) thought he saw a smoking gun in an e-mail correspondence from August 2011 in which Blumenthal encouraged Clinton to \"make a public statement before the cameras\" when Libyan leader Moammar Gaddafi was deposed.<\/p><p>\"Two months before the end of the Gaddafi regime and you're already planning on how to make your statement dramatic to maximize political gain,\" Roskam scolded.<\/p><p>Relevance to the Benghazi attack? None.<\/p><p>Gowdy, for his part, found it damning that Clinton aides passed along some of Blumenthal's advice (which he got from a former intelligence official) to people including Stevens. \"It's relevant because our ambassador was asked to read and respond to Sidney Blumenthal's drivel,\" the chairman said, \"in some instances on the very same day he was asking for security.\"<\/p><p>Rep. Adam B. Schiff (Calif.), a Democrat, observed that for all the time the panel has spent on Blumenthal, you'd think \"that he was in Benghazi on the night, manning the barricades.\" During private testimony from Blumenthal, to which he was summoned by federal marshals, Republicans asked more than 160 questions about Blumenthal's associations with Bill and Hillary Clinton but fewer than 20 about the Benghazi attacks.<\/p><p>Schiff and Rep. Elijah E. Cummings (Md.), the ranking Democrat, proposed that Republicans, rather than selectively releasing Blumenthal's e-mails, come clean about their interest in him and make public the entire transcript of his testimony. Gowdy, after a shouting match with Cummings, refused.<\/p><p>Read more from Dana Milbank's archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.","501":"Now that Newt Gingrich has vaulted into the lead in the Republican presidential stakes, he's going to be seeing a lot more of this:<\/p><p>Calling it the \"dumbest thing\" he has done in recent years isn't enough. This is not going away.<\/p><p>But, Newt can turn his pas-de-deux on the loveseat with Nancy into an opportunity to promote a consistent and electable political message.<\/p><p>Because he will be asked about this at every turn, Newt will have the air time and the opportunity to tell the truth on climate change\u2014based upon real science\u2014and to interface it with a limited-government philosophy. The two are easy to do.<\/p><p>Start with the obvious. Instead of waffling on the subject, he could just point out that earth's surface temperature is about 1\u00b0C warmer than it was a century ago. There were two periods of warming, the first from about 1910 through 1945, and the second from the mid-1970s to the late-1990s. They were both roughly the same magnitude. Because the first one was long before we put the majority of fossil carbon into the atmosphere, Newt can say\u2014with scientific authority\u2014that the magnitude of 'natural' climate change is likely to be at least as large as what humans have done.<\/p><p>Then Newt should proceed to the future. It's not the heat, it's the sensitivity. How much it will warm in the future is a function of how sensitive the atmosphere is to doubling atmospheric carbon dioxide. There are a number of independent arguments now coming together showing that this value may have been overestimated. The reference for the most recent is a November issue of Science.<\/p><p>Next, a little refreshing honesty: in 2009, the House of Representatives passed a cap-and-trade bill (which the Senate did not) commanding that the average american\u201438 years from now\u2014be allowed the carbon dioxide emissions of the average citizen in 1867. Prior to its passage, Newt was undeniably for such a system. Newt could call that that the \"second dumbest thing\" he has done and be finished with it.<\/p><p>After setting the record straight, how about interjecting his own political philosophy? When asked what to do about global warming, he should give the honest answer: if the atmosphere indeed is not as sensitive to carbon dioxide changes as previously thought, the correct response is nothing.<\/p><p>That's because \"nothing\" really means something. Newt should channel his historian. When markets are free, capital supports innovation more efficiently than when they aren't. Think about the remarkable changes in energy and technology in the last 100 years. Isn't it rather obvious that the same will occur in the next century, if only we don't hinder capital development? Newt might even use the catchy saw (first sloganed by Northern Illinois Gas in 1972) the future belongs to the efficient, and that there are impressive market forces that advantage those who produce things efficiently or produce efficient things.<\/p><p>When the doomsayers say Newt is believing in a Deus ex machine to dramatically cut carbon dioxide emissions, he might point out that those were the same folks who, only a very few years ago, told us we were running out of natural gas. Innovation and capital revolutionized drilling and fracturing shale, and we now know we have literally hundreds of years of it under our feet. There are a lot more voters and delegates around the country who will benefit from the shale revolution than there are in ethanol-addicted Iowa.","502":"Kenneth Ng calls his website a primer for tourists headed to<\/p><p>, but Fodor's it ain't.<\/p><p>The California State University at Northridge professor's site is a one-stop shop for men drawn to the country's sex tourism industry. Dotted with pictures of scantily clad women, the website, BigBabyKenny, advises would-be Johns on the art of negotiating with prostitutes. \"Start with a compliment,\" Ng advises.<\/p><p>Needless to say, Ng's website is causing headaches for Northridge administrators. First publicized by the Los Angeles Daily News, the economics professor's site has drawn a wave of unwelcome attention, forcing administrators to at once criticize its content and defend Ng's right to publish freely on his own time without university resources.<\/p><p>\"Until we find representative evidence that it infringes upon the work he does at the university itself, there's not much we can do about it,\" said Harold Hellenbrand, Northridge's provost.<\/p><p>There may be subtlety in Hellenbrand's words, but his message is clear: If BigBabyKenny infringes on Ng's ability to effectively do his job, then Northridge's position will change. Ng has already said his site is run through a separate server not connected to the university, but Northridge officials might still make a case that the site has interfered with his job. Asked if students complaining that they were no longer comfortable in Ng's class would compel Northridge to demand the site be taken down, Hellenbrand said \"I'm not inviting complaints, but you just hit on the key issue.\"<\/p><p>\"If [running the site is] what he wants to do, and at the same time he wants to educate students and students flock away, then that would create a problem,\" Hellenbrand said.<\/p><p>How Ng came to be identified as the author of BigBabyKenny is a story in itself. A frequent tourist of Thailand, Ng took to blogging on the website of a Bangkok bar called Big Mango Bar. In one controversial post, Ng advised men to seek women near a particular Buddhist shrine.<\/p><p>\"The naysayers will say its creepy to be hanging around the Muariti Shrine, hitting on the emotionally vulnerable girls desperately praying and paying Buddha for a better love life but I beg to differ. Buddha works in mysterious ways,\" he wrote.<\/p><p>Perturbed by the post, the bar owners removed it. That led Ng to start his own site, prompting what Ng describes as a concerted effort by the owners to publicize his penchant for writing about prostitutes. They sent mass e-mails to faculty listed in Northridge's directory, and also posted on RateMyProfessor.com, warning students about Ng, he said.<\/p><p>Ng readily defends the content of his site and says he has no intention of taking it down.<\/p><p>\"The university has no stake in this one way or the other, and besides, professors can say whatever they want,\" said Ng, a tenured associate professor of economics.<\/p><p>Some question whether Ng has crossed a gray legal line, however, by advising men on sex tourism. Patrick Trueman, a former U.S. justice department official, notes that there are several federal statutes that could come into play. Within U.S. Code 18 are two sections \u2013 2422 (a) and 2422 (b) \u2013 that specifically prohibit anyone from \"enticing or coercing a person\" to travel internationally in pursuit of prostitutes. Moreover, one section specifically prohibits the use of the Internet to lure people.<\/p><p>While prostitution may be tolerated in Thailand, that's immaterial under the federal code, Trueman said.<\/p><p>\"Inducing and enticing? Isn't that what this guy's doing?\" said Trueman, former chief of the Justice Department's Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section in the Criminal Division.<\/p><p>Trueman, now a lawyer specializing in sex trafficking and child abuse cases, said there would likely be debate about whether talking about procuring prostitutes online and actually arranging prostitutes for a person should be treated differently under the law.<\/p><p>\"Given how lax the fed government is on these crimes, they may not charge somebody unless they are more directly involved,\" he said. \"That's not to say this person couldn't be charged, and as I read it they could be charged.\"<\/p><p>Beyond the legal implications, critics have already attacked Ng on moral grounds. John Foubert, an Oklahoma State University professor who researches sex trafficking, argues that women \u2013 often minors \u2013 are forced into the sex tourism industry and often have trouble escaping it. Even if Ng is operating within the bounds of the law, Northridge officials have an ethical problem they've yet to face, Foubert said.<\/p><p>\"Do they want to live with the blood on their hands of these girls that are being essentially raped by these men, who are going down and purchasing sex? I think that's a larger question,\" said Foubert, an associate professor of college student development.<\/p><p>Ng said he allows anything to be written on his site, so long as it doesn't involve pedophilia or underage sex. He does, however, write about how difficult it is to effectively negotiate with a \"half or sometimes fully naked teenage girl\" when she's \"expertly gyrating\" on a man's lap.<\/p><p>While his critics have been speaking out since fall, Ng said he has yet to hear from a student who expressed discomfort about his website.<\/p><p>\"The job of the university is to expose students to the world \u2013 not just a politically correct view of the world and not just the good parts of the world,\" he said. \"If a student reads that [site], I personally think it's good for them. They learn about something out there; maybe they disapprove of it and they don't think it's good.\"<\/p><p>You share in the USA TODAY community, so please keep your comments smart and civil.

Ms. Temple said the longer Mr. Akin waited, the more difficult it would get.<\/p><p>The first deadline for Mr. Akin to have easily withdrawn from the race was Tuesday evening. His decision to stay in the race means that he now has only a few weeks to reconsider before things get even harder.<\/p><p>Certification of the presidential ballots in Missouri will be no later than Sept. 17, and could be shortly after President Obama officially accepts the Democratic nomination on Sept. 5.<\/p><p>Once the ballots are printed, any candidate who seeks to withdraw must pay for the reprinting of new ballots. That could be prohibitively expensive for Mr. Akin, but presumably the Republican Party \u2014 which badly wants him to withdraw \u2014 would cover the cost.<\/p><p>Military overseas ballots begin shipping out Sept. 22. That might be the first firm deadline. But the drop-dead deadline is Sept. 25, when general absentee ballots are sent out.<\/p><p>Mel Carnahan, the former Missouri governor and Ms. Carnahan's father, died on Oct. 16, 2000, during his campaign for the Senate against the Republican incumbent, John Ashcroft. Mr. Carnahan's name nonetheless appeared on the ballot in November \u2014 and he won. (His widow, Jean, was appointed to the seat, and lost it in special election in 2002.)<\/p><p>Assuming that Mr. Akin bows to pressure from Republican leaders (or simply concludes that he isn't able to raise enough money to mount a credible campaign), Missouri law requires that he seek a court order allowing him to drop out of the race.<\/p><p>State officials say that issuing such court orders is routine. Mr. Akin would merely have to file the necessary papers with the court and his name would no longer be printed on the November ballot. Republicans could then quickly nominate someone else to run against Senator Claire McCaskill, the Democratic incumbent.<\/p><p>Democrats would no doubt like to see Mr. Akin \u2014 now politically weakened by his comments on rape and pregnancy \u2014 stay in the race. In theory, the Democratic officials who run the state's election offices could object to Mr. Akin's request for a court order, a move that would force a hearing before a judge.<\/p><p>The relevant statute says someone like Mr. Akin can withdraw \"pursuant to a court order, which, except for good cause shown by the election authority in opposition thereto, shall be freely given upon application by the candidate to the circuit court in the county of such candidate's residence.\"<\/p><p>Election officials say they can find no precedent at all for such an objection in the state's history. But Ms. Carnahan is herself a factor in Republican minds. As the Democratic Senate nominee in 2010, she lost to Representative Roy Blunt, and Republicans imagine she could put up a fight.<\/p><p>\"The secretary's job is to protect the rights of Missouri voters,\" Ms. Temple said when asked whether Ms. Carnahan would fight a court order to remove Mr. Akin's name from the ballot.<\/p><p>A further complication: Under state law, any election authority in Missouri can oppose a withdrawal order, down to the county and city level, and there are Democrats aplenty in Missouri. But Ms. Temple added that right now, it would be up to a Missouri court to determine whether Mr. Akin could withdraw, not the secretary of state.<\/p><p>\"It's completely in the hands of the court to decide the facts,\" she said.<\/p><p>Assuming Mr. Akin does manage to drop out, the state central committee of the Republican Party in Missouri would have to pick a new candidate within 28 days, or by Oct. 12, whichever comes first.","504":"Most people, asked to identify the most universal shift in law enforcement over the past 15 years, would likely think of militarization, calls for community policing, or perhaps the slow decline of \"broken windows\".<\/p><p>But from the turn of the millennium to date, arguably no development has been more widespread in law enforcement than the adoption of so called \"less-lethal\" electric control devices (ECD), which many people know by the name of their most prolific manufacturer: Taser International. The company currently supplies their weapons to 17,800 of the United States' roughly 18,000 law enforcement agencies.<\/p><p>The brand name Taser has become as synonymous with these devices as Kleenex or Xerox have to photocopies and tissues \u2013 a quirk of language known as a \"proprietary eponym\". The word has even become a verb, as people commonly speak of being \"Tased\" or \"Tasered\".<\/p><p>The word Taser, though, didn't start with the company: it's actually a loose acronym of the book Tom Swift and His Electric Rifle. Jack Cover, the inventor of the modern ECD, named his prototype after the YA sci-fi novel he loved, and the very idea for a less-lethal electric gun was largely inspired by the fictional one described in the book.<\/p><p>And while this quirky history is known among some in law enforcement and engineering circles, the innocence with which it's told \u2013 a curious inventor culling inspiration from the literature of his youth \u2013 belies a more sinister truth: the book itself is boldly racist.<\/p><p>Tom Swift and His Electric Rifle, published in New York in 1911 under the pen name Victor Appleton, is typical of the literature of its time: an imperialist adventure tale set against the backdrop of a wild and dark African continent. In it, the protagonist, Tom Swift, develops an electric rifle \u2013 a totally novel idea in 1911 \u2013 and decides to test it in Africa in the hunt for ivory.<\/p><p>Africa, in the context of the book, exists only as a frontier of underexploited resources ripe for the wealth accumulation of white men daring enough to attempt. \"Elephant shooting in Africa! My! With my new electric rifle ... what a fellow couldn't do in the dark continent!\"<\/p><p>\"With the price of ivory soaring,\" says Swift's veteran hunting companion, \"there's a chance for us all to get a lot of money.\"<\/p><p>While this unabashed entrepreneurial imperialism tends to read as a relic of a bygone age, today disproportionately white police departments in places like Ferguson, Missouri, often function similarly as the adventurers sent to do the dangerous work of this kind of wealth generation. Like in the book, black communities are often seen not as dynamic places where people live lives, but as sites for plunder.<\/p><p>Take, for example, the Department of Justice's March report on the prevalence of predatory, revenue-based policing in St Louis County: entire municipalities there, as elsewhere in the US, float their operating budgets and justify their own existence on the racially biased extraction of statutory fees from primarily black residents. This scheme has only begun to decline because of the protests and organizing that defined Ferguson in the wake of Mike Brown's death.<\/p><p>In the book, as in America today, the black people are rendered as either passive, simple and childlike, or animalistic and capable of unimaginable violence.

Dotted with pictures of scantily clad women, the website, BigBabyKenny, advises would-be Johns on the art of negotiating with prostitutes. \"Start with a compliment,\" Ng advises.<\/p><p>Needless to say, Ng's website is causing headaches for Northridge administrators. First publicized by the Los Angeles Daily News, the economics professor's site has drawn a wave of unwelcome attention, forcing administrators to at once criticize its content and defend Ng's right to publish freely on his own time without university resources.<\/p><p>\"Until we find representative evidence that it infringes upon the work he does at the university itself, there's not much we can do about it,\" said Harold Hellenbrand, Northridge's provost.<\/p><p>There may be subtlety in Hellenbrand's words, but his message is clear: If BigBabyKenny infringes on Ng's ability to effectively do his job, then Northridge's position will change. Ng has already said his site is run through a separate server not connected to the university, but Northridge officials might still make a case that the site has interfered with his job. Asked if students complaining that they were no longer comfortable in Ng's class would compel Northridge to demand the site be taken down, Hellenbrand said \"I'm not inviting complaints, but you just hit on the key issue.\"<\/p><p>\"If [running the site is] what he wants to do, and at the same time he wants to educate students and students flock away, then that would create a problem,\" Hellenbrand said.<\/p><p>How Ng came to be identified as the author of BigBabyKenny is a story in itself. A frequent tourist of Thailand, Ng took to blogging on the website of a Bangkok bar called Big Mango Bar. In one controversial post, Ng advised men to seek women near a particular Buddhist shrine.<\/p><p>\"The naysayers will say its creepy to be hanging around the Muariti Shrine, hitting on the emotionally vulnerable girls desperately praying and paying Buddha for a better love life but I beg to differ. Buddha works in mysterious ways,\" he wrote.<\/p><p>Perturbed by the post, the bar owners removed it. That led Ng to start his own site, prompting what Ng describes as a concerted effort by the owners to publicize his penchant for writing about prostitutes. They sent mass e-mails to faculty listed in Northridge's directory, and also posted on RateMyProfessor.com, warning students about Ng, he said.<\/p><p>Ng readily defends the content of his site and says he has no intention of taking it down.<\/p><p>\"The university has no stake in this one way or the other, and besides, professors can say whatever they want,\" said Ng, a tenured associate professor of economics.<\/p><p>Some question whether Ng has crossed a gray legal line, however, by advising men on sex tourism. Patrick Trueman, a former U.S. justice department official, notes that there are several federal statutes that could come into play. Within U.S. Code 18 are two sections \u2013 2422 (a) and 2422 (b) \u2013 that specifically prohibit anyone from \"enticing or coercing a person\" to travel internationally in pursuit of prostitutes. Moreover, one section specifically prohibits the use of the Internet to lure people.<\/p><p>While prostitution may be tolerated in Thailand, that's immaterial under the federal code, Trueman said.<\/p><p>\"Inducing and enticing? Isn't that what this guy's doing?\" said Trueman, former chief of the Justice Department's Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section in the Criminal Division.<\/p><p>Trueman, now a lawyer specializing in sex trafficking and child abuse cases, said there would likely be debate about whether talking about procuring prostitutes online and actually arranging prostitutes for a person should be treated differently under the law.<\/p><p>\"Given how lax the fed government is on these crimes, they may not charge somebody unless they are more directly involved,\" he said. \"That's not to say this person couldn't be charged, and as I read it they could be charged.\"<\/p><p>Beyond the legal implications, critics have already attacked Ng on moral grounds. John Foubert, an Oklahoma State University professor who researches sex trafficking, argues that women \u2013 often minors \u2013 are forced into the sex tourism industry and often have trouble escaping it. Even if Ng is operating within the bounds of the law, Northridge officials have an ethical problem they've yet to face, Foubert said.<\/p><p>\"Do they want to live with the blood on their hands of these girls that are being essentially raped by these men, who are going down and purchasing sex? I think that's a larger question,\" said Foubert, an associate professor of college student development.<\/p><p>Ng said he allows anything to be written on his site, so long as it doesn't involve pedophilia or underage sex. He does, however, write about how difficult it is to effectively negotiate with a \"half or sometimes fully naked teenage girl\" when she's \"expertly gyrating\" on a man's lap.<\/p><p>While his critics have been speaking out since fall, Ng said he has yet to hear from a student who expressed discomfort about his website.<\/p><p>\"The job of the university is to expose students to the world \u2013 not just a politically correct view of the world and not just the good parts of the world,\" he said. \"If a student reads that [site], I personally think it's good for them. They learn about something out there; maybe they disapprove of it and they don't think it's good.\"<\/p><p>You share in the USA TODAY community, so please keep your comments smart and civil.

When the shoebox-shaped and nearly shoebox-size panini shop opened on Bedford Street 15 years ago, there was nothing quite like it in New York, a restaurant that kept things simple and kept prices low, serving flavorful food in a room that was just adorable enough that you could decide, midmeal, that maybe the two of you squeezed into the counter were there on a date, and not just grabbing a bite.<\/p><p>You have to fire up the Wayback Machine to better understand how 'ino helped change how this city eats. Fifteen years ago, New York was a bistro town. There was the old guard: Blue Ribbon, Le Gamin, Jules, Lucky Strike, Raoul's and a dozen others. Then in 1997, a newcomer opened in SoHo named Balthazar, which raised the stakes with its set direction and unlisted reservation line. Balthazar was white-hot: it had perfectly distressed mirrors, fresh and crusty bread, and although it was impossible to get a table unless you knew somebody who knew somebody, you could always go at midnight and eat at the bar.<\/p><p>Soon, New York was lousy with bistros. It was a good era if you wanted a kir, steak frites, escargot, fris\u00e9e lardon, profiteroles. Authenticity, or some version of it, was the point. Everybody was pressing butter into little ramekins to be served at room temperature, changing the paper covering the tablecloths before serving dessert.<\/p><p>Honestly, it was really fun. The restaurants were lively, intimate, sexy. So what if you could recite the menu before you set foot in the door? But if you were a young chef with a measure of vision and creativity, you were stuck either making onion soup and beet salad with goat cheese. Or you worked on the line executing the vision and creativity of an older chef in Midtown or TriBeCa. Prune hadn't yet opened. Neither had Diner. Brooklyn didn't have much of a food scene outside the restaurant row on Smith Street, which was anchored by Patois, a bistro. If you went to Williamsburg, it was to go to a party or to go dancing, not to eat. This was the landscape when Jason and Jennifer Denton opened 'ino on a quiet street in the West Village. The kitchen in the back was the size of a D.J. booth and used the technology of induction burners, which was novel at the time: it was a paninoteca that looked as if it belonged in New York rather than being shipped, tile by mirrored tile, from Milan.<\/p><p>The culinary vocabulary was Italian, but it wasn't sepia-toned and sentimental. Instead, there was a focus on ingredients at a time when, in New York at least, few people cared. It had simple food done well, and sometimes you encountered flavors that weren't lifted out of the songbook. I still have a 13-year-old memory of sharing a shredded duck sandwich with sweet relish, a combination that is about as authentically Italian as a functioning parliament. You could go to 'ino to get something familiar (prosciutto and cheese will never get old), but you could also try something new.<\/p><p>'Ino was a casual joint with integrity, an easygoing place where you could eat well as long as you didn't mind the wait. Today, we take this combination for granted, and expect all kitchens to put some effort into sourcing and display a little creativity no matter how limited the resources. That we do owes a little bit to 'ino.","509":"By DEXTER FORDMAY 9, 2014<\/p><p>MALIBU, CALIF. \u2014 Good luck, America, with your efforts to pigeonhole the BMW i8.<\/p><p>The car is a post-petroleum brand statement. It's a sci-fi showpiece. It's an ultralight carbon-fiber production car. It's a triumph of parts-bin engineering. It's a take-no-prisoners canyon racer. It's a winged chariot of the Malibu \u00fcber-chic. It's a $136,625 (destination included!) commuter car for Silicon Valley moguls.<\/p><p>The hardware, at least, is straightforward. The central passenger shell is a stiff, lightweight carbon-fiber structure. It is bolted to an aluminum skeleton that holds the 7.1-kilowatt-hour lithium-ion battery pack in its spine.<\/p><p>An electric drive section similar to the one in the BMW i3 people pod is bolted to the front, its 131 horsepower electric motor and 2-speed automatic transmission driving the front wheels. The rear power package is sourced from the new Mini; its 3-cylinder, twin-turbocharged 231-horsepower engine drives the rear wheels through a 6-speed automatic transmission.<\/p><p>The multilayered skin is molded thermoplastic that weighs half as much as steel. Other extreme weight-saving measures, including aluminum wiring and chemically hardened ultrathin glass, keep the weight to 3,267 pounds. The long, light doors swing up and forward. From the front, with doors open, the i8 looks as if it's signaling a touchdown.<\/p><p>The interior is compact yet comfortable, though those over 6-foot-2 may need more legroom, and the rear seats are designed for tiny, limber people.<\/p><p>Getting in is a challenge. The sill is wide, the seat is low, and there's a trick: sit sideways, slide butt in, retract legs. Getting out? Imagine climbing from a bathtub without using your hands.<\/p><p>Pick a personality with the driving-mode buttons. \"Comfort\" keeps the car in electric mode to 37 m.p.h., or until you mash the right-side pedal. The eDrive button keeps things electric to 75 m.p.h. or until the battery fades.<\/p><p>Travel range is about 20 miles in E.V. mode, and recharging takes 1.5 hours at 240 volts or four hours at 120. The Eco-Pro button increases electric efficiency 20 percent by softening the motor response and optimizing climate-control settings. I observed gasoline-powered mileage figures from 27 m.p.g. (impatient cornering) to 37 m.p.g. (safe-and-sane commuting).<\/p><p>In the city, the i8 feels silent, solid and intuitive \u2014 the excitement happens outside, as gawkers track its progress.<\/p><p>On Los Angeles's well-used freeways, the Comfort setting leaves some comfort to be desired. Even with the variable dampers at full soft, the i8 bobs its nose like Muhammad Ali in the first rounds. High-performance tires come standard in the United States; European versions get narrower wheels and taller tires for lower drag and a smoother ride.<\/p><p>In Sport mode, the suspension and steering stiffen and the gas engine roars, pops on upshifts and matches revs downshifting into corners. It sounds great, and it should: much of what you hear is a prerecorded soundtrack piped through the sound system.<\/p><p>The i8 feels strong at full power, but the head-snapping response expected from a partly electric powertrain is absent. The i8 takes time to gather itself, with an atavistic vestige of turbo lag.<\/p><p>On the intestinal twists of Mulholland Highway the i8 can be driven with brutal abandon. The brakes are strong, the chassis is as stiff as a bank vault, and there's enough power to reach the next corner presently. BMW claims a 0-to-60 time of 4.2 seconds, and top speed is 155 m.p.h.<\/p><p>The front tires push when going hard into corners, but everything sticks coming out. Even with the stability control off, the i8 resists spinning its tires \u2014 the software ghost is still there, lurking in the machine.<\/p><p>The i8 is complicated and imperfect. A car that will be used for emissions-free commuting should allow people to get in and get out. It rides harshly. The exterior design is too clever \u2014 the layered rear deck whispers \"Your trunk is open.\"<\/p><p>Still, if the i8 represents the future of sports cars, things are looking bright.<\/p><p>A version of this review appears in print on May 11, 2014, on page AU4 of the New York edition with the headline: The Future Will See You Now.

At area theaters. Running time: 154 mins. Rated R: Gory violence, incest theme. 3 1\/2 Stars.<\/p><p>If there's a soft spot in your heart for the sword-&-sandal epic - and from the star rating above, I think you can guess where I stand - then you'll swoon with giddy delight over \"Gladiator,\" a sweaty, stylish hunkfest that takes you back to the days of \"Ben-Hur,\" \"Spartacus\" and the so recently departed Steve Reeves.<\/p><p>From his biceps to his gluteus, Maximus is maximus. This Roman general turned slave turned gladiator hasn't a shred of humor, but then, he doesn't have time for idle nonsense when he's lopping off heads all day. (The head-lopping is apparently his signature, like the mark of Zorro.)<\/p><p>In director Ridley Scott's thrilling, burnished epic, Maximus no sooner serves the empire by leveling Germania during a snowstorm than Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) tosses him a promotion he doesn't want - to succeed the aged emperor and whip Rome back into shape. All Maximus wants is to go home to his wife and child in the suburbs.<\/p><p>The careworn Russell Crowe is physically and temperamentally perfect for the part of Maximus. Still carrying some of the weight he packed on for \"The Insider,\" he's no gym-toned pretty boy. He's solid, beefy, rough-hewn, creaking along in his heavy leather costume, with a look on his puss of weary disdain.<\/p><p>What makes him sexy is his sense of honor and loyalty: \"What we do in life echoes in eternity!\" Anyway, it can't be his hygiene, although he is frequently bathed in a sanctifying golden glow.<\/p><p>After a coup by the emperor's weak-kneed son, Commodus (a whiny, surprisingly fleshy Joaquin Phoenix), Maximus' fortunes change. He winds up being thrown to the tigers, two shows daily, in Rome's Colosseum, the entertainment complex of its day.<\/p><p>Crowe, like his character, must grimly come to terms with the fact that, actor or gladiator, it's all about showmanship. Give the crowd what it wants, either at the multiplex or in the arena, and you can write your own ticket.<\/p><p>\"I have power only to amuse the mob,\" he spits contemptuously like a Shakespearean actor reduced to dinner theater.<\/p><p>The plot, about avenging honor, provides brief respite between an array of hand-to-hand battles that are pitched so furiously that individual components barely register; they're subliminal suggestions of computer-assisted carnage, with Jackson Pollock sprays of blood. For fans of the genre, yes, this is a good thing.<\/p><p>Connie Nielsen plays Commodus' sister and possible love interest for Maximus once his family is dispatched (politics, you know). Nielsen's costumes are laced up like bondage gear, and there is a tantalizing hint of romance past.<\/p><p>But the camera only has eyes for Crowe. The glowering! The seething! The hooded gaze! The quiet suffering! (Watch him carve away a tattoo he no longer has use for. No anesthetic! No disinfectant!)<\/p><p>The supporting cast makes for a gauntlet of worthy friends and adversaries, all of them thinkers, including Derek Jacobi (\"I, Claudius\") as a senator, Djimon Hounsou (\"Amistad\") as a fellow gladiator and Oliver Reed, who died with two days to go on the shoot, looking a little woozy as a gladiator entrepreneur.<\/p><p>Reed's character is the one most in touch with the movie's premise - that entertainment is the goal, and a worthy one at that.","511":"The Coworking Resources Series is supported by join.me.

Though coworking can have a lot of perks, how you take advantage of them and shape your experience is up to you.<\/p><p>\"We've had people who within the first week they've kind of immersed themselves [in]to events and socializing with other people here, or they're just here, they do their work, and then they take off,\" says Jeff Park, who manages the Ravenswood Coworking Group in Chicago. \"We know that they come in, but I think for them that's enough for them. They just want to be around other people in a productive environment.\"<\/p><p>Whether you're aiming to be as productive as possible without a lot of socializing or trying to build a strong professional community that you can turn to for resources and support, these five tips can help you get the most out of your coworking experience.<\/p><p>Green Spaces, a coworking space in Tribeca, specializes in environmentally focused businesses. Mountain View-based Cubes & Crayons combines childcare and coworking. WorkBar in Boston is hosted in a 2,500-square-foot space and has separate areas for cafe-like and quieter working styles. Coworking Brooklyn uses a small room that functions as an art gallery by night.<\/p><p>The coworking experience varies drastically depending on which space you're using. Different spaces have different levels of interaction with other workers, formality and general vibe. While some spaces, like Green Spaces and Cubes & Crayons, state their niche upfront, you'll only be able to gauge what the environment is like by dropping in. Most spaces have daily drop-in rates. Try a couple of different spaces to see what works best for you before you commit. You can find a list of space around the world on the Coworking Wiki.<\/p><p>\"See if the people in the space are people who you could go and see every day\u2026if it's not, then go to the next space,\" says Jay Catalan, the co-founder of a coworking space in Vancouver called The Network Hub.<\/p><p>It's less awkward to introduce yourself on the first day than to work alongside someone for months before asking their name. Even if you're not usually outgoing, try to make a special effort for the first week or two when you start in a new coworking space.<\/p><p>\"Just make introductions and it goes a long way\u2026We've had some people they wish they had met sooner because it turns out they did similar lines of work and just talking about it or actually sharing work, it's not something you want to find out when you only have a couple more months left on your project or something,\" Park says.<\/p><p>If you're shy about meeting people, try getting creative (like, for instance, bringing food). Bill Jacobson and Dave Ulrich, who co-founded WorkBar, said that one new coworker at WorkBar Boston showed up with a big box of doughnuts. \"He got to know everybody pretty quick,\" Jacobson says.<\/p><p>Don't stop interacting with your coworkers after you introduce yourself. One of the biggest benefits of coworking is the built-in community of professionals working across different industries.<\/p><p>\"It may not seem directly 'productive' to chat with your coworker for 10 minutes mid-day, but indirectly, it yields greater results than almost anything else you could spend time on,\" says Parker Whitney, office manager for Philadelphia coworking space Independents Hall, though he says, \"Invest in your community by taking (not faking) interest in what its members do, and it will take you with it\u2026The people you've always wanted to know are sitting all around you. Ask questions. Learn. Most importantly, help them when you can.\"<\/p><p>If you are too busy during the workday for water cooler conversation, most coworking spaces host happy hours, seminars or other events that are prime opportunities for learning more about your coworkers.<\/p><p>\"Even when you work for yourself, it's important to realize your limitations,\" says Dave Martorana, a freelance Python & iPhone developer who works at Independents Hall. \"If you're a software developer, you're not necessarily a designer, product manager, or marketer as well. When you work at a coworking space, people with those skills probably work right next to you and are just as interested in building something awesome as you are.\"<\/p><p>While coworking one day, I ended up testing someone's website, getting caught in the crossfire of a music choice showdown, and participating in a raised-hand vote about which suit jacket a fellow coworker should wear to a meeting. Needless to say, the social aspects of coworking \u2014 despite their advantages \u2014 can be extremely distracting.<\/p><p>Which is why out of the 37 productivity tips that I collected for a previous article, this one from Paul Preibisch of B3D Multitech remains my favorite:<\/p><p>\"Rather than standing up from behind your wall of monitors and shouting, 'Can you all shut up?!' you may want to consider, what I call 'The Cone of Silence.'

He joined the Post as a political reporter in 2000.<\/p><p>Chairman Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.), reading from Blumenthal's e-mails to Clinton as if he were the teacher who had intercepted a note passed between two high school kids, said Blumenthal referred to Gates as \"a mean, vicious little\"\u2014 Gowdy paused. \"I'm not going to say the word, but he did.\"<\/p><p>He also quoted Blumenthal referring to then- national security adviser Thomas E. Donilon's \"babbling rhetoric,\" and he said Blumenthal had referred to \"Obama\" (he \"left the 'president' part out\") and \"his political cronies in the White House and Chicago.\"<\/p><p>Clinton refused to get riled. \"I don't know what this line of questioning does to help us get to the bottom of deaths of four Americans,\" she said.<\/p><p>But Gowdy knew. A couple of minutes later, he announced: \"I'll tell you what: If you think you've heard about Sidney Blumenthal so far, wait until the next round.\"<\/p><p>He and his colleagues made good on that statement, posing questions on a Blumenthal visit to Clinton's home, about his work for the Clinton Foundation, his business interests, his attempt to get a job at the State Department and his communication with the former secretary of state over matters as mundane as her new iPad. They were particularly concerned with whether Blumenthal's advice to Clinton on Libya was \"unsolicited.\"<\/p><p>The Blumenthal focus shows that, after 17 months of probing Clinton, the Benghazi committee hasn't come up with much. Blumenthal has been a Clinton hatchet man for years, and he has an unsavory reputation. The very mention of his name (he was prominent during the Monica Lewinsky scandal) lends a whiff of skulduggery to any situation.<\/p><p>But injecting Blumenthal as a central character in the Benghazi probe doesn't help Republicans demonstrate that Clinton did wrong. And the justification for invoking him \u2014 to demonstrate that Clinton had more contact with him than with Stevens \u2014 is a stretch. Whatever else one thinks of the former journalist \u2014 I've clashed with him over the years \u2014 he had nothing to do with what happened in Libya on Sept. 11 and 12, 2012.<\/p><p>Rep. Mike Pompeo (R-Kan.) acted as if he had found a video of Blumenthal attacking the compound himself. Pompeo, who had previously made the false allegation that Clinton got \"most of her intelligence\" on Libya from Blumenthal, asked whether Stevens had Clinton's personal e-mail, her cellphone number, fax or home address or visited her at home. \"Mr. Blumenthal had each of those and did each of those things,\" Pompeo concluded.<\/p><p>Rep. Peter J. Roskam (R-Ill.) thought he saw a smoking gun in an e-mail correspondence from August 2011 in which Blumenthal encouraged Clinton to \"make a public statement before the cameras\" when Libyan leader Moammar Gaddafi was deposed.<\/p><p>\"Two months before the end of the Gaddafi regime and you're already planning on how to make your statement dramatic to maximize political gain,\" Roskam scolded.<\/p><p>Relevance to the Benghazi attack? None.<\/p><p>Gowdy, for his part, found it damning that Clinton aides passed along some of Blumenthal's advice (which he got from a former intelligence official) to people including Stevens. \"It's relevant because our ambassador was asked to read and respond to Sidney Blumenthal's drivel,\" the chairman said, \"in some instances on the very same day he was asking for security.\"<\/p><p>Rep. Adam B. Schiff (Calif.), a Democrat, observed that for all the time the panel has spent on Blumenthal, you'd think \"that he was in Benghazi on the night, manning the barricades.\" During private testimony from Blumenthal, to which he was summoned by federal marshals, Republicans asked more than 160 questions about Blumenthal's associations with Bill and Hillary Clinton but fewer than 20 about the Benghazi attacks.<\/p><p>Schiff and Rep. Elijah E. Cummings (Md.), the ranking Democrat, proposed that Republicans, rather than selectively releasing Blumenthal's e-mails, come clean about their interest in him and make public the entire transcript of his testimony. Gowdy, after a shouting match with Cummings, refused.<\/p><p>Read more from Dana Milbank's archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.","514":"Though it may feel out of the way \u2014 far, far east on the Lower East Side \u2014 there's no missing American Realness once you get there. In its seventh edition, this annual festival of contemporary performance announces itself boldly, its name projected in big block letters on the facade of Abrons Arts Center, home to most of the festival's 18 boundary-blurring productions.<\/p><p>It doesn't take much to inject new life into an event sometimes at risk of stagnating, even as it champions the fresh, the unseen, the unexpected. At opening night on Thursday, visitors were guided from show to show through stairwells and hallways generally closed to the public. For anyone well acquainted with Abrons, as many Realness-goers are, this proved a simple, effective way to reinvent familiar spaces.<\/p><p>Masterminded by Thomas Benjamin Snapp Pryor, Realness coincides with the citywide conference of the Association of Performing Arts Presenters \u2014 international curators and producers in the market for new work \u2014 which returns each year like a recurring dream, or nightmare, depending on your relationship to the idea of shopping for live art. Last year's festival was full of work bemoaning the economic plight of performers; this year's first two productions struck out in less sullen directions, while still folding in some self-reflexive critique (also available in the form of Realness swag declaring, \"I Suffer From Realness\").<\/p><p>First was \"Culture Administration & Trembling,\" a biodiverse collaboration among the performers Jennifer Lacey, Antonija Livingstone, Dominique P\u00e9trin and Stephen Thompson. Ticket holders were instructed to remove their shoes, then led to the second floor of the arts complex, where a usually drab lobby had been transformed with geometric and botanical designs on the floor and walls.<\/p><p>Ms. Lacey, Ms. Livingstone, Mr. Thompson and Dana Michel crawled languidly around the asymmetrical room, the audience huddled around the perimeter, to a soundscape of intermittent bird song. Ms. P\u00e9trin appeared just as calmly immersed in her task of adorning the ground with origami squares. Three live snakes, delivered from offstage, soon joined in. Humans and reptiles slid over and around one another.<\/p><p>This was just the first of many tenuously related, increasingly chaotic episodes, including the arrival of two Chihuahuas (the snakes, not to worry, had exited) and a migration into the adjacent black-box theater for a ritualistic ringing of hand-held bells. A mysterious voice, accompanying a video projection, pronounced, \"This piece will not save us.\" Ms. Lacey, cradling a small, three-legged dog while bending and stretching her limbs, told a story about an artist and an institution (Realness, perhaps) trying to spice up their relationship like old lovers. What to do with all this information? I thought of dance as undomesticated wildlife, of the predators and prey involved in buying and selling performance.<\/p><p>Down one set of stairs and up another, in a tucked-away dance studio not often used for performances, the choreographer Heather Kravas, visiting from Seattle, offered the New York premiere of \"dead, disappears.\" Ms. Kravas was her own predator and protector in this stark, self-punishing solo, as she put herself through perilous paces inspired by the sculptor Richard Serra's \"Verb List,\" a series of actions that he associated with making his pieces.<\/p><p>What seemed at first like arbitrary acts of masochism \u2014 walking on tiptoe with a trash bag over her head while barking two-syllable phrases \u2014 deepened into a formidable exploration of language, the female body and the power play between them. Having duct-taped a pillow to a chair, as if it were a prisoner, Ms. Kravas pounded it with a long pole, shouting a list of alphabetized verbs, one per swipe. By the end, in whatever this struggle had been, she had secured the upper hand.<\/p><p>American Realness continues through Jan. 17. Most performances are at Abrons Arts Center, 466 Grand Street, Manhattan; 866-811-4111, americanrealness\u00ad.com.<\/p><p>A version of this review appears in print on January 9, 2016, on page C1 of the New York edition with the headline: Audacious Movements and Slitherings.

Small businesses and families starving for credit will eventually get relief as the funding props up banks and they increase lending, but Rajoy didn't offer guidance on when.<\/p><p>Spain on Saturday became the fourth \u2014 and largest \u2014 of the 17 countries that use Europe's common currency to request a bailout \u2014 a big blow to a nation that a few years ago took pride as the continent's economic superstar only to see it become the hot spot in the eurozone debt crisis. Its economy is the eurozone's fourth largest after Germany, France and Italy.<\/p><p>Across the country, Spaniards reacted with a mixture of anger and relief to the news. The amount of the rescue fund, if all is tapped, amounts to \u20ac21,000 of new debt for each person in the nation of 47 million where the average annual salary for those with work is about the same amount and the unemployment rate for those under age 25 is 52 percent.<\/p><p>The country is already reeling from deep austerity cuts Rajoy has imposed over the last six months that have raised taxes, made it easier to hire and fire workers, and cut deep into cherished government programs including education and national health care.<\/p><p>\"It's obviously a shame,\" said civil servant Luisa Saraguren, 44, as she strolled on a sunny Sunday morning with her young daughter. \"But this bailout was fully predictable, and the consequences of this help are going to be a lot bigger compared to the cuts we've been living with already.\"<\/p><p>Rajoy took pains to avoid the word bailout Sunday, saying Spain's rescue package is a line of credit that its most troubled banks will be able to tap. The assistance will not come with the outside control over government macroeconomic policy like that imposed Greece, Ireland and Portugal when their public finances were bailed out.<\/p><p>He said interest rates on the loans will be considerably lower than the rate near 7 percent that Spain has been forced to pay recently on the international debt markets, a level that forced the other countries to seek bailouts.<\/p><p>Spain will regain the economic credibility it has lost by shoring up its banks, which will result in credit being restored so businesses and individuals shut off from loans can start borrowing and the economy will grow again, Rajoy insisted, again without saying when.<\/p><p>Europe's widening recession and financial crisis has hurt companies and investors around the world. Providing a financial lifeline to Spanish banks is likely to relieve anxiety on the Spanish economy \u2014 which is five times larger than Greece's \u2014 and on markets concerned about the country's ability to pay its way.<\/p><p>Spain's financial problems are not due to Greek-style government over-spending. The country's banks particularly its savings banks or \"cajas,\" got caught up in the collapse of a real estate bubble in 2008 that got worse over the past four years. However, as Spain's leaders have struggled for a solution to their banking crisis, the country's borrowing costs have soared close to the level that forced the governments of Greece, Portugal and Ireland to seek rescues.<\/p><p>Some of Spain's banks are struggling with by toxic real estate loans and assets amid fears the problem will get worse as more jobless people can't pay their mortgages. The Bank of Spain says the toxic loans and assets total around \u20ac180 billion. Nationalized lender Bankia SA, which has requested \u20ac19 billion in aid, has \u20ac32 billion in toxic assets. Around four other banks serving the domestic market are considered prime candidates for bailouts.<\/p><p>\"I could never get my mind round the scale of consumption in Spain over the past 20 years, having known it in the 1960s when it was still extremely poor,\" said Paul Preston, a history professor and expert on Spain with the London School of Economics. \"Lots of people enjoyed the consumer boom, but not everybody. Now everybody's having to pay for it.\"<\/p><p>Rajoy blamed Spain's woes on the previous Socialist administration of Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero without mentioning him or his government by name. Zapatero was ousted by Rajoy in a landslide last November by voters outraged over the Socialist handling of the economy.<\/p><p>\"Last year Spain's public administration spent \u20ac90 billion more than it took in, this can't be maintained, we can't live like that,\" Rajoy said.<\/p><p>But Socialist Party leader Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba said Rajoy should acknowledge that Spain is now in bailout territory.<\/p><p>\"The government is trying to make us believe that we've won the lottery, that the Three Kings of Orient have arrived, and that isn't so,\" Rubalcaba said.<\/p><p>After his press conference, Rajoy defended his decision to jet off an hour later to Poland to see Spain's famed national football team take on Italy in the Euro 2012 competition. He said he would be on the ground in Gdansk only for the game before flying back to Madrid Sunday night.<\/p><p>\"I'll be there two and a half hours and then I'll leave,\" Rajoy said. \"I think the national team deserves it.\"","520":"By DEXTER FORDMAY 9, 2014<\/p><p>MALIBU, CALIF. \u2014 Good luck, America, with your efforts to pigeonhole the BMW i8.<\/p><p>The car is a post-petroleum brand statement. It's a sci-fi showpiece. It's an ultralight carbon-fiber production car. It's a triumph of parts-bin engineering. It's a take-no-prisoners canyon racer. It's a winged chariot of the Malibu \u00fcber-chic. It's a $136,625 (destination included!) commuter car for Silicon Valley moguls.<\/p><p>The hardware, at least, is straightforward. The central passenger shell is a stiff, lightweight carbon-fiber structure. It is bolted to an aluminum skeleton that holds the 7.1-kilowatt-hour lithium-ion battery pack in its spine.<\/p><p>An electric drive section similar to the one in the BMW i3 people pod is bolted to the front, its 131 horsepower electric motor and 2-speed automatic transmission driving the front wheels. The rear power package is sourced from the new Mini; its 3-cylinder, twin-turbocharged 231-horsepower engine drives the rear wheels through a 6-speed automatic transmission.<\/p><p>The multilayered skin is molded thermoplastic that weighs half as much as steel. Other extreme weight-saving measures, including aluminum wiring and chemically hardened ultrathin glass, keep the weight to 3,267 pounds. The long, light doors swing up and forward. From the front, with doors open, the i8 looks as if it's signaling a touchdown.<\/p><p>The interior is compact yet comfortable, though those over 6-foot-2 may need more legroom, and the rear seats are designed for tiny, limber people.<\/p><p>Getting in is a challenge. The sill is wide, the seat is low, and there's a trick: sit sideways, slide butt in, retract legs. Getting out? Imagine climbing from a bathtub without using your hands.<\/p><p>Pick a personality with the driving-mode buttons. \"Comfort\" keeps the car in electric mode to 37 m.p.h., or until you mash the right-side pedal. The eDrive button keeps things electric to 75 m.p.h. or until the battery fades.<\/p><p>Travel range is about 20 miles in E.V. mode, and recharging takes 1.5 hours at 240 volts or four hours at 120. The Eco-Pro button increases electric efficiency 20 percent by softening the motor response and optimizing climate-control settings. I observed gasoline-powered mileage figures from 27 m.p.g. (impatient cornering) to 37 m.p.g. (safe-and-sane commuting).<\/p><p>In the city, the i8 feels silent, solid and intuitive \u2014 the excitement happens outside, as gawkers track its progress.<\/p><p>On Los Angeles's well-used freeways, the Comfort setting leaves some comfort to be desired. Even with the variable dampers at full soft, the i8 bobs its nose like Muhammad Ali in the first rounds. High-performance tires come standard in the United States; European versions get narrower wheels and taller tires for lower drag and a smoother ride.<\/p><p>In Sport mode, the suspension and steering stiffen and the gas engine roars, pops on upshifts and matches revs downshifting into corners. It sounds great, and it should: much of what you hear is a prerecorded soundtrack piped through the sound system.<\/p><p>The i8 feels strong at full power, but the head-snapping response expected from a partly electric powertrain is absent. The i8 takes time to gather itself, with an atavistic vestige of turbo lag.<\/p><p>On the intestinal twists of Mulholland Highway the i8 can be driven with brutal abandon. The brakes are strong, the chassis is as stiff as a bank vault, and there's enough power to reach the next corner presently. BMW claims a 0-to-60 time of 4.2 seconds, and top speed is 155 m.p.h.<\/p><p>The front tires push when going hard into corners, but everything sticks coming out. Even with the stability control off, the i8 resists spinning its tires \u2014 the software ghost is still there, lurking in the machine.<\/p><p>The i8 is complicated and imperfect. A car that will be used for emissions-free commuting should allow people to get in and get out. It rides harshly. The exterior design is too clever \u2014 the layered rear deck whispers \"Your trunk is open.\"<\/p><p>Still, if the i8 represents the future of sports cars, things are looking bright.<\/p><p>A version of this review appears in print on May 11, 2014, on page AU4 of the New York edition with the headline: The Future Will See You Now.

The company currently supplies their weapons to 17,800 of the United States' roughly 18,000 law enforcement agencies.<\/p><p>The brand name Taser has become as synonymous with these devices as Kleenex or Xerox have to photocopies and tissues \u2013 a quirk of language known as a \"proprietary eponym\". The word has even become a verb, as people commonly speak of being \"Tased\" or \"Tasered\".<\/p><p>The word Taser, though, didn't start with the company: it's actually a loose acronym of the book Tom Swift and His Electric Rifle. Jack Cover, the inventor of the modern ECD, named his prototype after the YA sci-fi novel he loved, and the very idea for a less-lethal electric gun was largely inspired by the fictional one described in the book.<\/p><p>And while this quirky history is known among some in law enforcement and engineering circles, the innocence with which it's told \u2013 a curious inventor culling inspiration from the literature of his youth \u2013 belies a more sinister truth: the book itself is boldly racist.<\/p><p>Tom Swift and His Electric Rifle, published in New York in 1911 under the pen name Victor Appleton, is typical of the literature of its time: an imperialist adventure tale set against the backdrop of a wild and dark African continent. In it, the protagonist, Tom Swift, develops an electric rifle \u2013 a totally novel idea in 1911 \u2013 and decides to test it in Africa in the hunt for ivory.<\/p><p>Africa, in the context of the book, exists only as a frontier of underexploited resources ripe for the wealth accumulation of white men daring enough to attempt. \"Elephant shooting in Africa! My! With my new electric rifle ... what a fellow couldn't do in the dark continent!\"<\/p><p>\"With the price of ivory soaring,\" says Swift's veteran hunting companion, \"there's a chance for us all to get a lot of money.\"<\/p><p>While this unabashed entrepreneurial imperialism tends to read as a relic of a bygone age, today disproportionately white police departments in places like Ferguson, Missouri, often function similarly as the adventurers sent to do the dangerous work of this kind of wealth generation. Like in the book, black communities are often seen not as dynamic places where people live lives, but as sites for plunder.<\/p><p>Take, for example, the Department of Justice's March report on the prevalence of predatory, revenue-based policing in St Louis County: entire municipalities there, as elsewhere in the US, float their operating budgets and justify their own existence on the racially biased extraction of statutory fees from primarily black residents.

It isn't meaningless that today that sequence sometimes appears to persist in reverse.","523":"Most people, asked to identify the most universal shift in law enforcement over the past 15 years, would likely think of militarization, calls for community policing, or perhaps the slow decline of \"broken windows\".<\/p><p>But from the turn of the millennium to date, arguably no development has been more widespread in law enforcement than the adoption of so called \"less-lethal\" electric control devices (ECD), which many people know by the name of their most prolific manufacturer: Taser International. The company currently supplies their weapons to 17,800 of the United States' roughly 18,000 law enforcement agencies.<\/p><p>The brand name Taser has become as synonymous with these devices as Kleenex or Xerox have to photocopies and tissues \u2013 a quirk of language known as a \"proprietary eponym\". The word has even become a verb, as people commonly speak of being \"Tased\" or \"Tasered\".<\/p><p>The word Taser, though, didn't start with the company: it's actually a loose acronym of the book Tom Swift and His Electric Rifle. Jack Cover, the inventor of the modern ECD, named his prototype after the YA sci-fi novel he loved, and the very idea for a less-lethal electric gun was largely inspired by the fictional one described in the book.<\/p><p>And while this quirky history is known among some in law enforcement and engineering circles, the innocence with which it's told \u2013 a curious inventor culling inspiration from the literature of his youth \u2013 belies a more sinister truth: the book itself is boldly racist.<\/p><p>Tom Swift and His Electric Rifle, published in New York in 1911 under the pen name Victor Appleton, is typical of the literature of its time: an imperialist adventure tale set against the backdrop of a wild and dark African continent. In it, the protagonist, Tom Swift, develops an electric rifle \u2013 a totally novel idea in 1911 \u2013 and decides to test it in Africa in the hunt for ivory.<\/p><p>Africa, in the context of the book, exists only as a frontier of underexploited resources ripe for the wealth accumulation of white men daring enough to attempt. \"Elephant shooting in Africa! My! With my new electric rifle ... what a fellow couldn't do in the dark continent!\"<\/p><p>\"With the price of ivory soaring,\" says Swift's veteran hunting companion, \"there's a chance for us all to get a lot of money.\"<\/p><p>While this unabashed entrepreneurial imperialism tends to read as a relic of a bygone age, today disproportionately white police departments in places like Ferguson, Missouri, often function similarly as the adventurers sent to do the dangerous work of this kind of wealth generation. Like in the book, black communities are often seen not as dynamic places where people live lives, but as sites for plunder.<\/p><p>Take, for example, the Department of Justice's March report on the prevalence of predatory, revenue-based policing in St Louis County: entire municipalities there, as elsewhere in the US, float their operating budgets and justify their own existence on the racially biased extraction of statutory fees from primarily black residents.

Monsanto mon says it is not considering physical barriers like fences or guards.<\/p><p>The FBI and the U.S. Justice Department say cases of espionage in the agriculture sector have been growing since Mo was first discovered digging in an Iowan field in May 2011. Over the past two years, U.S. companies, government research facilities and universities have all been targeted, according to the FBI.<\/p><p>Although prosecutors were unable to establish a Chinese government link to Mo's group, the case adds to U.S.-China frictions over what Washington says is increasing economic espionage and trade secret theft by Beijing and its proxies.<\/p><p>A U.S. law enforcement official told Reuters the agency looked for a connection between the Chinese government and the conspiracy carried out by Mo.<\/p><p>\"In cases like this, we can see connections, but proving to the threshold needed in court requires that we have documents that the government has directed this,\" the official said. \"It's almost impossible to get.\"<\/p><p>A Chinese embassy spokesman in Washington, Zhu Haiquan, said he did not have detailed information on the Mo case but that China \"stands firm\" on the protection of intellectual property and maintains \"constant communication and cooperation\" with the U.S. government on the issue.<\/p><p>On his visit to Washington last September, President Xi Jinping reiterated China's denial of any government role in the hacking of U.S. corporate secrets.<\/p><p>Mo, an employee of Chinese firm Kings Nower Seed, pleaded guilty to stealing seed grown by U.S. firms Monsanto, Dupont Pioneer dd and LG Seeds.<\/p><p>Prosecutors say he specifically targeted fields that grow the parent seeds needed to replicate GMO corn. The FBI says it suspects he was given the location by workers for the seed companies, but did not charge any employees.<\/p><p>DuPont Pioneer and LG Seeds declined to comment for this story.<\/p><p>Mo, whose case was prosecuted by the Justice Department as a national security matter rather than a simple criminal case, now faces a sentence of up to five years in prison. Five others charged in the case are still wanted by the FBI and are believed to have fled to China or Argentina. Charges were dropped against a sixth Chinese suspect.<\/p><p>The number of international economic espionage cases referred to the FBI is rising, up 15% each year between 2009 and 2014 and up 53% in 2015. The majority of cases reported involve Chinese nationals, the U.S. law enforcement official told Reuters. In the agriculture sector, organic insecticide, irrigation equipment and rice, along with corn, are all suspected to have been targeted, including by Chinese nationals, the official said.<\/p><p>Mo Hongjian, vice president of Kings Nower Seed's parent company, Beijing Dabeinong Technology Group, declined to comment on the case or on the company's connection with the Chinese government.<\/p><p>The parent firm is privately owned, but says it receives government money for research in \"science and technology.\"<\/p><p>China bans commercial growing of GMO grains due to public opposition to the technology and imports of GMO corn have to be approved by the agriculture ministry. Still, President Xi called in 2014 for China to innovate and dominate the technique, which promises high yields through resistance to drought, pests and disease.<\/p><p>In January, a Greenpeace report found some Chinese farmers are illegally growing GMO corn whose strains belong to companies including Monsanto, Syngenta syt and DuPont Pioneer.<\/p><p>Monsanto, which supplies Burrack's seed, said it can block foreign groups who request to tour their lab and learning center in Huxley, Iowa. For the past few years, Monsanto says it has run its own background checks on Chinese delegations that ask for a tour, and, if they are approved, boosts security to be sure they do not steal anything or take pictures.<\/p><p>In Washington, U.S. senators have called for a review of the $43 billion deal by state-owned ChemChina to buy Swiss seed group Syngenta, which generates nearly a quarter of its revenue from North America.<\/p><p>Acquiring GMO seed and successfully recreating a corn plant would allow Chinese companies to skip over roughly eight years of research and $1.5 billion spent annually by Monsanto to develop the corn, the company says.<\/p><p>Burrack's farm itself was not targeted by Mo, though he grows the Monsanto parent seed that the Chinese national was digging for. Burrack grows the corn in two fields in front of and behind his house where he can watch them, a small part of his 2,800-acre farm.<\/p><p>He said he is told by Monsanto where and when to plant the parent seed, but has never been told to keep what he is planting a secret.<\/p><p>\"What no one seems to understand is that they're stealing from people like me,\" Burrack said. \"They're stealing the research that farmers pay for when they buy Monsanto seed.\"","525":"Termed a \"man of enough words\" recently by Jim Harbaugh, 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick needed just three syllables Sunday to explain why wide receiver Michael Crabtree has emerged as his favorite target.<\/p><p>In San Francisco's past three games, Crabtree has been targeted 34 times, 20 more than wide receiver Randy Moss, who is second in targets over that span.

Beginning with its shot of a Pontiac GTO pulling doughnuts in a high school parking lot to Aerosmith's \"Sweet Emotion,\" \"Dazed\" is such a humane approximation of what it was like to come of age in the mid-1970s that one wishes it would never end. On the evidence of \"Boyhood\" and the \"Before Sunrise\" trilogy, though, Linklater doesn't want any of his movies to end. Thus \"Everybody Wants Some!!\"<\/p><p>Which at first is different, sometimes jarringly so, before wading into the open-armed embrace of experience that marks this filmmaker's finest work. The tipoffs are those double exclamation points and an onscreen title font that recalls a Skinemax late-night movie circa 1981. What if you took one of that era's hormone-drenched stu-coms and put real people in it?<\/p><p>The year is 1980, actually, and Jake (Blake Jenner from \"Glee\") is arriving for his freshman year at (the fictional) Southeastern Texas State University. A high school pitching star and rangy college prospect, he's assigned an off-campus baseball dorm with the other players. It's a ready-made animal house, with rules laid down by a briefly seen coach (Jonathan Breck) that are immediately ignored. Occasionally we'll get an onscreen reminder of how many dwindling days and hours remain before classes begin. These, too, are ignored.<\/p><p>Instead, Linklater parks his cameras to observe, with indulgence and much good humor, the bonding rituals of young men who only think they have it figured out. Jake's housemates fall into general categories that re-sort themselves into individual personalities: The motor-mouthed ladies' man Finnegan (Glen Powell), the Zen surfer-stoner Willoughby (Wyatt Russell), uber-competitive McReynolds (Tyler Hoechlin), country rube Billy (Will Brittain), smartass Nesbit (Austin Amelio), na\u00efve Brumley (Tanner Kalina). And so on.<\/p><p>A few stand slightly outside the pack: the over-confident psycho-nerd pitcher Jay Niles (Juston Street, freakily funny) and the laconic second base star Dale Douglas (J. Quinton Johnson), whose blackness is rarely commented on. Where are the women? There to be chased and partied with and seduced. \"This is college, Jake,\" the hero is told early on. \"The girls can be as big sluts as the guys.\"<\/p><p>Oh, dear. Is \"Everybody Wants Some!!\" what happens when you people an entire Richard Linklater movie with Matthew McConaughey's horndog Wooderson from \"Dazed and Confused\"? Yes and no, or, rather, yes, but only at first. As the boys sprawl through the last days of summer, the swagger that borders on smug begins to mellow and melt away. Searching for good times and girls, they hop from a disco one night to a country and western bar the next to a punk mosh pit to an art-student costume party, minds open, adapting, ever-changing. After a while, the hero starts having a smallish identity crisis, confessing that \"it sort of begs the question of who we are.\"<\/p><p>Well, yes. This is college, Jake. Even a high school sports star can be anyone he wants.<\/p><p>The movie eventually spins him off from the crowd into the arms of Beverly (Zoey Deutch), a tartly ardent stage arts freshman with Joni Mitchell posters on her wall. She's unpretentious for a theater brat, he's smart and soulful for a jock, and the two stand dazzled in the Venn diagram overlap of their attraction. These scenes try a little too hard to be charming but they are anyway, and if Deutch has the freckles and immediacy of a classic Brat Pack heroine, it may be because her mother is Lea Thompson of \"Back to the Future\" and \"Some Kind of Wonderful\" and her father is Howard Deutch, who directed the latter.<\/p><p>More second-generation pleasures: Wyatt Russell, who plays the woolly baseball mystic Willoughby, is the son of Kurt Russell and Goldie Hawn, and he has a high old time \u2014 emphasis on high \u2014 explaining to his teammates why \"Fearless,\" from the 1971 album \"Meddle,\" is the best track that Pink Floyd ever recorded. Because he is correct, I am awarding \"Everybody Wants Some!!\" an extra half-star.<\/p><p>Linklater was a high school baseball player who went to Sam Houston State on a scholarship, and the movie is steeped in the lazy, rivalrous minutiae of college ball. Willoughby gets off a moment of bliss when he muses on the pleasures of pitching \u2014 \"It's lovely out there on the bump,\" he says \u2014 and we learn that it's the .230 hitters who are always the most superstitious. Also that it's possible to slice a pitched baseball in half with an ax. At one point, one of the characters gazes with incredulity at a crowd of fellow students and says, \"I know what we're doing here. We're playing baseball. What are they doing here?\"<\/p><p>\"Everybody Wants Some!!\" is a nice long soak in the Proustian detritus of its era. Beverly drives a Gremlin, Jake knows the secret of winning at \"Space Invaders,\" and people can still confidently begin sentences with the words, \"It's like Carl Sagan says. . .\" What \"Sweet Emotion\" was to \"Dazed and Confused,\" so the Knack's \"My Sharona\" is to this movie, and the soundtrack rolls forward from there: glorious junk from the days when Eddie Rabbitt, Eddie Money, Sniff 'n' the Tears, and the BusBoys meant something.<\/p><p>All that's missing is a plot. But Linklater doesn't do plot; he does life. Says Powell's garrulous Finnegan, summing up the art of both this movie and this moviemaker, \"I don't think at all. I just talk a lot. It's jazz improv. You're invited.\" And so are we.<\/p><p>Written and directed by Richard Linklater. Starring Blake Jenner, Zoey Deutch, Glen Powell, Wyatt Russell, Tyler Hoechlin, Juston Street.

That could be prohibitively expensive for Mr. Akin, but presumably the Republican Party \u2014 which badly wants him to withdraw \u2014 would cover the cost.<\/p><p>Military overseas ballots begin shipping out Sept. 22. That might be the first firm deadline. But the drop-dead deadline is Sept. 25, when general absentee ballots are sent out.<\/p><p>Mel Carnahan, the former Missouri governor and Ms. Carnahan's father, died on Oct. 16, 2000, during his campaign for the Senate against the Republican incumbent, John Ashcroft. Mr. Carnahan's name nonetheless appeared on the ballot in November \u2014 and he won. (His widow, Jean, was appointed to the seat, and lost it in special election in 2002.)<\/p><p>Assuming that Mr. Akin bows to pressure from Republican leaders (or simply concludes that he isn't able to raise enough money to mount a credible campaign), Missouri law requires that he seek a court order allowing him to drop out of the race.<\/p><p>State officials say that issuing such court orders is routine. Mr. Akin would merely have to file the necessary papers with the court and his name would no longer be printed on the November ballot. Republicans could then quickly nominate someone else to run against Senator Claire McCaskill, the Democratic incumbent.<\/p><p>Democrats would no doubt like to see Mr. Akin \u2014 now politically weakened by his comments on rape and pregnancy \u2014 stay in the race. In theory, the Democratic officials who run the state's election offices could object to Mr. Akin's request for a court order, a move that would force a hearing before a judge.<\/p><p>The relevant statute says someone like Mr. Akin can withdraw \"pursuant to a court order, which, except for good cause shown by the election authority in opposition thereto, shall be freely given upon application by the candidate to the circuit court in the county of such candidate's residence.\"<\/p><p>Election officials say they can find no precedent at all for such an objection in the state's history. But Ms. Carnahan is herself a factor in Republican minds. As the Democratic Senate nominee in 2010, she lost to Representative Roy Blunt, and Republicans imagine she could put up a fight.<\/p><p>\"The secretary's job is to protect the rights of Missouri voters,\" Ms. Temple said when asked whether Ms. Carnahan would fight a court order to remove Mr. Akin's name from the ballot.<\/p><p>A further complication: Under state law, any election authority in Missouri can oppose a withdrawal order, down to the county and city level, and there are Democrats aplenty in Missouri. But Ms. Temple added that right now, it would be up to a Missouri court to determine whether Mr. Akin could withdraw, not the secretary of state.<\/p><p>\"It's completely in the hands of the court to decide the facts,\" she said.<\/p><p>Assuming Mr. Akin does manage to drop out, the state central committee of the Republican Party in Missouri would have to pick a new candidate within 28 days, or by Oct. 12, whichever comes first.","531":"In a Facebook post on Sunday, 'ino announced that it had closed. When the shoebox-shaped and nearly shoebox-size panini shop opened on Bedford Street 15 years ago, there was nothing quite like it in New York, a restaurant that kept things simple and kept prices low, serving flavorful food in a room that was just adorable enough that you could decide, midmeal, that maybe the two of you squeezed into the counter were there on a date, and not just grabbing a bite.<\/p><p>You have to fire up the Wayback Machine to better understand how 'ino helped change how this city eats. Fifteen years ago, New York was a bistro town. There was the old guard: Blue Ribbon, Le Gamin, Jules, Lucky Strike, Raoul's and a dozen others. Then in 1997, a newcomer opened in SoHo named Balthazar, which raised the stakes with its set direction and unlisted reservation line. Balthazar was white-hot: it had perfectly distressed mirrors, fresh and crusty bread, and although it was impossible to get a table unless you knew somebody who knew somebody, you could always go at midnight and eat at the bar.<\/p><p>Soon, New York was lousy with bistros. It was a good era if you wanted a kir, steak frites, escargot, fris\u00e9e lardon, profiteroles. Authenticity, or some version of it, was the point. Everybody was pressing butter into little ramekins to be served at room temperature, changing the paper covering the tablecloths before serving dessert.<\/p><p>Honestly, it was really fun. The restaurants were lively, intimate, sexy. So what if you could recite the menu before you set foot in the door? But if you were a young chef with a measure of vision and creativity, you were stuck either making onion soup and beet salad with goat cheese. Or you worked on the line executing the vision and creativity of an older chef in Midtown or TriBeCa. Prune hadn't yet opened. Neither had Diner. Brooklyn didn't have much of a food scene outside the restaurant row on Smith Street, which was anchored by Patois, a bistro. If you went to Williamsburg, it was to go to a party or to go dancing, not to eat. This was the landscape when Jason and Jennifer Denton opened 'ino on a quiet street in the West Village. The kitchen in the back was the size of a D.J. booth and used the technology of induction burners, which was novel at the time: it was a paninoteca that looked as if it belonged in New York rather than being shipped, tile by mirrored tile, from Milan.<\/p><p>The culinary vocabulary was Italian, but it wasn't sepia-toned and sentimental. Instead, there was a focus on ingredients at a time when, in New York at least, few people cared. It had simple food done well, and sometimes you encountered flavors that weren't lifted out of the songbook. I still have a 13-year-old memory of sharing a shredded duck sandwich with sweet relish, a combination that is about as authentically Italian as a functioning parliament. You could go to 'ino to get something familiar (prosciutto and cheese will never get old), but you could also try something new.<\/p><p>'Ino was a casual joint with integrity, an easygoing place where you could eat well as long as you didn't mind the wait. Today, we take this combination for granted, and expect all kitchens to put some effort into sourcing and display a little creativity no matter how limited the resources. That we do owes a little bit to 'ino.","532":"Though it may feel out of the way \u2014 far, far east on the Lower East Side \u2014 there's no missing American Realness once you get there. In its seventh edition, this annual festival of contemporary performance announces itself boldly, its name projected in big block letters on the facade of Abrons Arts Center, home to most of the festival's 18 boundary-blurring productions.<\/p><p>It doesn't take much to inject new life into an event sometimes at risk of stagnating, even as it champions the fresh, the unseen, the unexpected. At opening night on Thursday, visitors were guided from show to show through stairwells and hallways generally closed to the public. For anyone well acquainted with Abrons, as many Realness-goers are, this proved a simple, effective way to reinvent familiar spaces.<\/p><p>Masterminded by Thomas Benjamin Snapp Pryor, Realness coincides with the citywide conference of the Association of Performing Arts Presenters \u2014 international curators and producers in the market for new work \u2014 which returns each year like a recurring dream, or nightmare, depending on your relationship to the idea of shopping for live art. Last year's festival was full of work bemoaning the economic plight of performers; this year's first two productions struck out in less sullen directions, while still folding in some self-reflexive critique (also available in the form of Realness swag declaring, \"I Suffer From Realness\").<\/p><p>First was \"Culture Administration & Trembling,\" a biodiverse collaboration among the performers Jennifer Lacey, Antonija Livingstone, Dominique P\u00e9trin and Stephen Thompson. Ticket holders were instructed to remove their shoes, then led to the second floor of the arts complex, where a usually drab lobby had been transformed with geometric and botanical designs on the floor and walls.<\/p><p>Ms. Lacey, Ms. Livingstone, Mr. Thompson and Dana Michel crawled languidly around the asymmetrical room, the audience huddled around the perimeter, to a soundscape of intermittent bird song. Ms. P\u00e9trin appeared just as calmly immersed in her task of adorning the ground with origami squares. Three live snakes, delivered from offstage, soon joined in. Humans and reptiles slid over and around one another.<\/p><p>This was just the first of many tenuously related, increasingly chaotic episodes, including the arrival of two Chihuahuas (the snakes, not to worry, had exited) and a migration into the adjacent black-box theater for a ritualistic ringing of hand-held bells. A mysterious voice, accompanying a video projection, pronounced, \"This piece will not save us.\" Ms. Lacey, cradling a small, three-legged dog while bending and stretching her limbs, told a story about an artist and an institution (Realness, perhaps) trying to spice up their relationship like old lovers. What to do with all this information? I thought of dance as undomesticated wildlife, of the predators and prey involved in buying and selling performance.<\/p><p>Down one set of stairs and up another, in a tucked-away dance studio not often used for performances, the choreographer Heather Kravas, visiting from Seattle, offered the New York premiere of \"dead, disappears.\" Ms. Kravas was her own predator and protector in this stark, self-punishing solo, as she put herself through perilous paces inspired by the sculptor Richard Serra's \"Verb List,\" a series of actions that he associated with making his pieces.<\/p><p>What seemed at first like arbitrary acts of masochism \u2014 walking on tiptoe with a trash bag over her head while barking two-syllable phrases \u2014 deepened into a formidable exploration of language, the female body and the power play between them. Having duct-taped a pillow to a chair, as if it were a prisoner, Ms. Kravas pounded it with a long pole, shouting a list of alphabetized verbs, one per swipe. By the end, in whatever this struggle had been, she had secured the upper hand.<\/p><p>American Realness continues through Jan. 17. Most performances are at Abrons Arts Center, 466 Grand Street, Manhattan; 866-811-4111, americanrealness\u00ad.com.<\/p><p>A version of this review appears in print on January 9, 2016, on page C1 of the New York edition with the headline: Audacious Movements and Slitherings.

Dotted with pictures of scantily clad women, the website, BigBabyKenny, advises would-be Johns on the art of negotiating with prostitutes. \"Start with a compliment,\" Ng advises.<\/p><p>Needless to say, Ng's website is causing headaches for Northridge administrators. First publicized by the Los Angeles Daily News, the economics professor's site has drawn a wave of unwelcome attention, forcing administrators to at once criticize its content and defend Ng's right to publish freely on his own time without university resources.<\/p><p>\"Until we find representative evidence that it infringes upon the work he does at the university itself, there's not much we can do about it,\" said Harold Hellenbrand, Northridge's provost.<\/p><p>There may be subtlety in Hellenbrand's words, but his message is clear: If BigBabyKenny infringes on Ng's ability to effectively do his job, then Northridge's position will change. Ng has already said his site is run through a separate server not connected to the university, but Northridge officials might still make a case that the site has interfered with his job. Asked if students complaining that they were no longer comfortable in Ng's class would compel Northridge to demand the site be taken down, Hellenbrand said \"I'm not inviting complaints, but you just hit on the key issue.\"<\/p><p>\"If [running the site is] what he wants to do, and at the same time he wants to educate students and students flock away, then that would create a problem,\" Hellenbrand said.<\/p><p>How Ng came to be identified as the author of BigBabyKenny is a story in itself. A frequent tourist of Thailand, Ng took to blogging on the website of a Bangkok bar called Big Mango Bar. In one controversial post, Ng advised men to seek women near a particular Buddhist shrine.<\/p><p>\"The naysayers will say its creepy to be hanging around the Muariti Shrine, hitting on the emotionally vulnerable girls desperately praying and paying Buddha for a better love life but I beg to differ. Buddha works in mysterious ways,\" he wrote.<\/p><p>Perturbed by the post, the bar owners removed it. That led Ng to start his own site, prompting what Ng describes as a concerted effort by the owners to publicize his penchant for writing about prostitutes. They sent mass e-mails to faculty listed in Northridge's directory, and also posted on RateMyProfessor.com, warning students about Ng, he said.<\/p><p>Ng readily defends the content of his site and says he has no intention of taking it down.<\/p><p>\"The university has no stake in this one way or the other, and besides, professors can say whatever they want,\" said Ng, a tenured associate professor of economics.<\/p><p>Some question whether Ng has crossed a gray legal line, however, by advising men on sex tourism. Patrick Trueman, a former U.S. justice department official, notes that there are several federal statutes that could come into play. Within U.S. Code 18 are two sections \u2013 2422 (a) and 2422 (b) \u2013 that specifically prohibit anyone from \"enticing or coercing a person\" to travel internationally in pursuit of prostitutes. Moreover, one section specifically prohibits the use of the Internet to lure people.<\/p><p>While prostitution may be tolerated in Thailand, that's immaterial under the federal code, Trueman said.<\/p><p>\"Inducing and enticing? Isn't that what this guy's doing?\" said Trueman, former chief of the Justice Department's Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section in the Criminal Division.<\/p><p>Trueman, now a lawyer specializing in sex trafficking and child abuse cases, said there would likely be debate about whether talking about procuring prostitutes online and actually arranging prostitutes for a person should be treated differently under the law.<\/p><p>\"Given how lax the fed government is on these crimes, they may not charge somebody unless they are more directly involved,\" he said. \"That's not to say this person couldn't be charged, and as I read it they could be charged.\"<\/p><p>Beyond the legal implications, critics have already attacked Ng on moral grounds. John Foubert, an Oklahoma State University professor who researches sex trafficking, argues that women \u2013 often minors \u2013 are forced into the sex tourism industry and often have trouble escaping it. Even if Ng is operating within the bounds of the law, Northridge officials have an ethical problem they've yet to face, Foubert said.<\/p><p>\"Do they want to live with the blood on their hands of these girls that are being essentially raped by these men, who are going down and purchasing sex? I think that's a larger question,\" said Foubert, an associate professor of college student development.<\/p><p>Ng said he allows anything to be written on his site, so long as it doesn't involve pedophilia or underage sex. He does, however, write about how difficult it is to effectively negotiate with a \"half or sometimes fully naked teenage girl\" when she's \"expertly gyrating\" on a man's lap.<\/p><p>While his critics have been speaking out since fall, Ng said he has yet to hear from a student who expressed discomfort about his website.<\/p><p>\"The job of the university is to expose students to the world \u2013 not just a politically correct view of the world and not just the good parts of the world,\" he said. \"If a student reads that [site], I personally think it's good for them. They learn about something out there; maybe they disapprove of it and they don't think it's good.\"<\/p><p>You share in the USA TODAY community, so please keep your comments smart and civil.

Many of the attempts in recent years have been, at best, mid-budget passion projects with circumscribed audiences (Stallone's own<\/p><p>which topped out at $42 million domestically) or post-modern winks (the French-language \"JCVD\" from 2008, a hostage movie in which Jean-Claude Van Damme plays a version of himself). The few large-scale attempts, like \"The A-Team,\" underperformed. (The biceps-and-bullets remake grossed $77 million domestically, a number that will likely be easily surpassed by \"The Expendables.\")<\/p><p>But the Stallone picture -- with its hard-charging, take-no-prisoners patriotism unbothered by the vagaries of the real world (it takes place in a fictional country, for starters) and its caricature of freedom-hating enemies (\"We will kill this American disease,\" as the TV spot enticed us) -- planted itself squarely in the old-school genre. And this weekend, the movie showed that there's life in that category yet. That \"Scott Pilgrim vs. the World,\" the tongue-in-cheek, pop-culture-referential, decidedly 2010 creation -- the one for, of and by arch fanboys -- trailed well behind \"The Expendables\" only drove home the point more loudly.<\/p><p>On one hand, it's understandable that a movie of easy American heroism (OK, first-world Western heroism) would catch on. In fact, it's surprising it didn't happen sooner. Apple-pie-patriotism already is behind the success of a cable news network and supports large sections of the contemporary country music industry. Why not a film hit too?<\/p><p>But among all the factors to which one might point in explaining the success of \"The Expendables\" -- a cast harvested from so many demographics and eras; a moviegoer backlash to 3-D and CG effects -- it somehow doesn't feel that the demand for neat heroes and villains is one of them.<\/p><p>Norris and his ilk would submit that in our current period of ideological and geopolitical upheaval, in a time of blurry lines between enemies and friends in places such as Afghanistan and Iraq, that black-and-white heroes slake a patriotic thirst (and that, indeed, the movie-going world can support a lot more of them). But history argues the opposite: Those movies succeed when the culture at large is filled with clear-cut distinctions. On the other hand, when the zeitgeist is more cloudy, an entirely different kind of cinema prospers.<\/p><p>The post-WWII era and its mainly straightforward distinctions between good and evil, to take an example of the former, yielded a flowering subgenre of movies with morally uncomplicated gunslingers. And 30 years later, the ideological simplicity of the Cold War and its larger-than-life Evil Empire gave rise to the very action movies on which \"Expendables\" is modeled (not to mention the ultimate in us-versus-them confections, \"Rocky IV.\" Yes, there's a Stallone-ishness to all of this). There are plenty of reasons why these types of movies faded from view in the 1990s, but the fall of the Berlin Wall and the the Soviet Union certainly played a part.<\/p><p>The examples are just as abundant on the other side. The ambiguities of the Vietnam War and the counterculture in the late 1960s and early 1970s undoubtedly offered up the moral murkiness of<\/p><p>\"Midnight Cowboy\" and scores of others. In the post-9\/11 world, meanwhile, movies like<\/p><p>-- with its themes of a destruction-bent enemy that can't be bargained with, and the question of what constitutes an acceptable ethical compromise in fighting that enemy -- have captured our imagination. You can throw<\/p><p>in there too, to the degree the movie was a contemplation of Western interests in the Middle East.<\/p><p>Political eras are, of course, rarely just one thing or another, and the movies we want to see in a given period are hardly monolithic. But as tempting as it is to infer that the success of \"The Expendables\" shows a deeper cultural need, it may well be the wrong inference. When times are confusing, we want movies to reflect that confusion, and even to make sense of it. But we probably don't want to pretend that confusion doesn't exist.<\/p><p>Photo: A scene from \"The Expendables.\" Credit: Lionsgate<\/p><p>Stallone: I'm contemplating an \"Expendables\" sequel<\/p><p>Hollywood wonders if Schwarzenegger will be back","540":"NEW YORK -- Ruben Tejada thinks Chase Utley's late slide that broke his right leg was dirty.<\/p><p>Speaking about the play for the first time since Utley ended Tejada's season in Game 2 of the NL Division Series against the Los Angeles Dodgers, the Mets shortstop said he's no longer upset over it.<\/p><p>Using a blue cane adorned with a Mets logo giving to him by the team's owners, Tejada hung out with teammates in the dugout before Game 4 of the World Series.<\/p><p>He says he's come to terms with what happened, even though he never responded to the message Utley sent him through captain David Wright.

Beginning with its shot of a Pontiac GTO pulling doughnuts in a high school parking lot to Aerosmith's \"Sweet Emotion,\" \"Dazed\" is such a humane approximation of what it was like to come of age in the mid-1970s that one wishes it would never end. On the evidence of \"Boyhood\" and the \"Before Sunrise\" trilogy, though, Linklater doesn't want any of his movies to end. Thus \"Everybody Wants Some!!\"<\/p><p>Which at first is different, sometimes jarringly so, before wading into the open-armed embrace of experience that marks this filmmaker's finest work. The tipoffs are those double exclamation points and an onscreen title font that recalls a Skinemax late-night movie circa 1981. What if you took one of that era's hormone-drenched stu-coms and put real people in it?<\/p><p>The year is 1980, actually, and Jake (Blake Jenner from \"Glee\") is arriving for his freshman year at (the fictional) Southeastern Texas State University. A high school pitching star and rangy college prospect, he's assigned an off-campus baseball dorm with the other players. It's a ready-made animal house, with rules laid down by a briefly seen coach (Jonathan Breck) that are immediately ignored. Occasionally we'll get an onscreen reminder of how many dwindling days and hours remain before classes begin. These, too, are ignored.<\/p><p>Instead, Linklater parks his cameras to observe, with indulgence and much good humor, the bonding rituals of young men who only think they have it figured out. Jake's housemates fall into general categories that re-sort themselves into individual personalities: The motor-mouthed ladies' man Finnegan (Glen Powell), the Zen surfer-stoner Willoughby (Wyatt Russell), uber-competitive McReynolds (Tyler Hoechlin), country rube Billy (Will Brittain), smartass Nesbit (Austin Amelio), na\u00efve Brumley (Tanner Kalina). And so on.<\/p><p>A few stand slightly outside the pack: the over-confident psycho-nerd pitcher Jay Niles (Juston Street, freakily funny) and the laconic second base star Dale Douglas (J. Quinton Johnson), whose blackness is rarely commented on. Where are the women? There to be chased and partied with and seduced. \"This is college, Jake,\" the hero is told early on. \"The girls can be as big sluts as the guys.\"<\/p><p>Oh, dear. Is \"Everybody Wants Some!!\" what happens when you people an entire Richard Linklater movie with Matthew McConaughey's horndog Wooderson from \"Dazed and Confused\"? Yes and no, or, rather, yes, but only at first. As the boys sprawl through the last days of summer, the swagger that borders on smug begins to mellow and melt away. Searching for good times and girls, they hop from a disco one night to a country and western bar the next to a punk mosh pit to an art-student costume party, minds open, adapting, ever-changing. After a while, the hero starts having a smallish identity crisis, confessing that \"it sort of begs the question of who we are.\"<\/p><p>Well, yes. This is college, Jake. Even a high school sports star can be anyone he wants.<\/p><p>The movie eventually spins him off from the crowd into the arms of Beverly (Zoey Deutch), a tartly ardent stage arts freshman with Joni Mitchell posters on her wall. She's unpretentious for a theater brat, he's smart and soulful for a jock, and the two stand dazzled in the Venn diagram overlap of their attraction. These scenes try a little too hard to be charming but they are anyway, and if Deutch has the freckles and immediacy of a classic Brat Pack heroine, it may be because her mother is Lea Thompson of \"Back to the Future\" and \"Some Kind of Wonderful\" and her father is Howard Deutch, who directed the latter.<\/p><p>More second-generation pleasures: Wyatt Russell, who plays the woolly baseball mystic Willoughby, is the son of Kurt Russell and Goldie Hawn, and he has a high old time \u2014 emphasis on high \u2014 explaining to his teammates why \"Fearless,\" from the 1971 album \"Meddle,\" is the best track that Pink Floyd ever recorded. Because he is correct, I am awarding \"Everybody Wants Some!!\" an extra half-star.<\/p><p>Linklater was a high school baseball player who went to Sam Houston State on a scholarship, and the movie is steeped in the lazy, rivalrous minutiae of college ball. Willoughby gets off a moment of bliss when he muses on the pleasures of pitching \u2014 \"It's lovely out there on the bump,\" he says \u2014 and we learn that it's the .230 hitters who are always the most superstitious. Also that it's possible to slice a pitched baseball in half with an ax. At one point, one of the characters gazes with incredulity at a crowd of fellow students and says, \"I know what we're doing here. We're playing baseball. What are they doing here?\"<\/p><p>\"Everybody Wants Some!!\" is a nice long soak in the Proustian detritus of its era. Beverly drives a Gremlin, Jake knows the secret of winning at \"Space Invaders,\" and people can still confidently begin sentences with the words, \"It's like Carl Sagan says. . .\" What \"Sweet Emotion\" was to \"Dazed and Confused,\" so the Knack's \"My Sharona\" is to this movie, and the soundtrack rolls forward from there: glorious junk from the days when Eddie Rabbitt, Eddie Money, Sniff 'n' the Tears, and the BusBoys meant something.<\/p><p>All that's missing is a plot. But Linklater doesn't do plot; he does life. Says Powell's garrulous Finnegan, summing up the art of both this movie and this moviemaker, \"I don't think at all. I just talk a lot. It's jazz improv. You're invited.\" And so are we.<\/p><p>Written and directed by Richard Linklater. Starring Blake Jenner, Zoey Deutch, Glen Powell, Wyatt Russell, Tyler Hoechlin, Juston Street.

Small businesses and families starving for credit will eventually get relief as the funding props up banks and they increase lending, but Rajoy didn't offer guidance on when.<\/p><p>Spain on Saturday became the fourth \u2014 and largest \u2014 of the 17 countries that use Europe's common currency to request a bailout \u2014 a big blow to a nation that a few years ago took pride as the continent's economic superstar only to see it become the hot spot in the eurozone debt crisis. Its economy is the eurozone's fourth largest after Germany, France and Italy.<\/p><p>Across the country, Spaniards reacted with a mixture of anger and relief to the news. The amount of the rescue fund, if all is tapped, amounts to \u20ac21,000 of new debt for each person in the nation of 47 million where the average annual salary for those with work is about the same amount and the unemployment rate for those under age 25 is 52 percent.<\/p><p>The country is already reeling from deep austerity cuts Rajoy has imposed over the last six months that have raised taxes, made it easier to hire and fire workers, and cut deep into cherished government programs including education and national health care.<\/p><p>\"It's obviously a shame,\" said civil servant Luisa Saraguren, 44, as she strolled on a sunny Sunday morning with her young daughter. \"But this bailout was fully predictable, and the consequences of this help are going to be a lot bigger compared to the cuts we've been living with already.\"<\/p><p>Rajoy took pains to avoid the word bailout Sunday, saying Spain's rescue package is a line of credit that its most troubled banks will be able to tap. The assistance will not come with the outside control over government macroeconomic policy like that imposed Greece, Ireland and Portugal when their public finances were bailed out.<\/p><p>He said interest rates on the loans will be considerably lower than the rate near 7 percent that Spain has been forced to pay recently on the international debt markets, a level that forced the other countries to seek bailouts.<\/p><p>Spain will regain the economic credibility it has lost by shoring up its banks, which will result in credit being restored so businesses and individuals shut off from loans can start borrowing and the economy will grow again, Rajoy insisted, again without saying when.<\/p><p>Europe's widening recession and financial crisis has hurt companies and investors around the world. Providing a financial lifeline to Spanish banks is likely to relieve anxiety on the Spanish economy \u2014 which is five times larger than Greece's \u2014 and on markets concerned about the country's ability to pay its way.<\/p><p>Spain's financial problems are not due to Greek-style government over-spending. The country's banks particularly its savings banks or \"cajas,\" got caught up in the collapse of a real estate bubble in 2008 that got worse over the past four years. However, as Spain's leaders have struggled for a solution to their banking crisis, the country's borrowing costs have soared close to the level that forced the governments of Greece, Portugal and Ireland to seek rescues.<\/p><p>Some of Spain's banks are struggling with by toxic real estate loans and assets amid fears the problem will get worse as more jobless people can't pay their mortgages. The Bank of Spain says the toxic loans and assets total around \u20ac180 billion. Nationalized lender Bankia SA, which has requested \u20ac19 billion in aid, has \u20ac32 billion in toxic assets. Around four other banks serving the domestic market are considered prime candidates for bailouts.<\/p><p>\"I could never get my mind round the scale of consumption in Spain over the past 20 years, having known it in the 1960s when it was still extremely poor,\" said Paul Preston, a history professor and expert on Spain with the London School of Economics. \"Lots of people enjoyed the consumer boom, but not everybody. Now everybody's having to pay for it.\"<\/p><p>Rajoy blamed Spain's woes on the previous Socialist administration of Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero without mentioning him or his government by name. Zapatero was ousted by Rajoy in a landslide last November by voters outraged over the Socialist handling of the economy.<\/p><p>\"Last year Spain's public administration spent \u20ac90 billion more than it took in, this can't be maintained, we can't live like that,\" Rajoy said.<\/p><p>But Socialist Party leader Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba said Rajoy should acknowledge that Spain is now in bailout territory.<\/p><p>\"The government is trying to make us believe that we've won the lottery, that the Three Kings of Orient have arrived, and that isn't so,\" Rubalcaba said.<\/p><p>After his press conference, Rajoy defended his decision to jet off an hour later to Poland to see Spain's famed national football team take on Italy in the Euro 2012 competition. He said he would be on the ground in Gdansk only for the game before flying back to Madrid Sunday night.<\/p><p>\"I'll be there two and a half hours and then I'll leave,\" Rajoy said. \"I think the national team deserves it.\"","544":"Jess Quinn is training for a 10km race.

Two-thirds of its revenue comes from Sinovel, a state-owned Chinese company. That is both good and bad. The dependence on Sinovel was a big help during last year's downturn, but in the future it could be a significant risk. as also makes high-temperature superconducting wire with carrying capacity 150 times that of copper wire, perfect for the global upgrade to a more efficient electrical grid. The superconductor division is not yet profitable, but the rest of the business should earn $1.35 a share over the next year. I expect 30% annual earnings gains over the next five years.<\/p><p>Fuel Tech (FTEK, 10) develops technology to reduce nitrogen oxide (NOX) emissions from power plants. Fuel Tech stumbled last summer when the U.S. District Court of Appeals vacated the Environmental Protection Agency's rule spelling out timetables for NOX reduction across the eastern half of the U.S. In a surprise move the same Court of Appeals reinstated the Clean Air Interstate Rule in December, and it went into effect on Jan. 1 as originally scheduled. Fuel Tech also sells chemicals that are tossed into a coal burner to fight slag and thereby boost power plant efficiency. The company generates most of its revenue in the U.S., but management is looking to expand in emerging markets like China and eastern Europe, where pollution-control technology is still quite new.<\/p><p>Fuel Tech shares look expensive at 78 times my earnings projection of 15 cents a share for the 12 months beginning in July, but I expect rapid growth. It is reasonable to expect earnings of 60 cents a share in 2010.<\/p><p>President Obama's proposed focus on cybersecurity will benefit ArcSight ( ARST - news - people )(ARST, 17).

It's been nearly two decades since pictures of this sort were produced with any regularity by the studio system, and a lot longer since they were stateside successes. Many of the attempts in recent years have been, at best, mid-budget passion projects with circumscribed audiences (Stallone's own<\/p><p>which topped out at $42 million domestically) or post-modern winks (the French-language \"JCVD\" from 2008, a hostage movie in which Jean-Claude Van Damme plays a version of himself). The few large-scale attempts, like \"The A-Team,\" underperformed. (The biceps-and-bullets remake grossed $77 million domestically, a number that will likely be easily surpassed by \"The Expendables.\")<\/p><p>But the Stallone picture -- with its hard-charging, take-no-prisoners patriotism unbothered by the vagaries of the real world (it takes place in a fictional country, for starters) and its caricature of freedom-hating enemies (\"We will kill this American disease,\" as the TV spot enticed us) -- planted itself squarely in the old-school genre. And this weekend, the movie showed that there's life in that category yet. That \"Scott Pilgrim vs. the World,\" the tongue-in-cheek, pop-culture-referential, decidedly 2010 creation -- the one for, of and by arch fanboys -- trailed well behind \"The Expendables\" only drove home the point more loudly.<\/p><p>On one hand, it's understandable that a movie of easy American heroism (OK, first-world Western heroism) would catch on. In fact, it's surprising it didn't happen sooner. Apple-pie-patriotism already is behind the success of a cable news network and supports large sections of the contemporary country music industry. Why not a film hit too?<\/p><p>But among all the factors to which one might point in explaining the success of \"The Expendables\" -- a cast harvested from so many demographics and eras; a moviegoer backlash to 3-D and CG effects -- it somehow doesn't feel that the demand for neat heroes and villains is one of them.<\/p><p>Norris and his ilk would submit that in our current period of ideological and geopolitical upheaval, in a time of blurry lines between enemies and friends in places such as Afghanistan and Iraq, that black-and-white heroes slake a patriotic thirst (and that, indeed, the movie-going world can support a lot more of them). But history argues the opposite: Those movies succeed when the culture at large is filled with clear-cut distinctions. On the other hand, when the zeitgeist is more cloudy, an entirely different kind of cinema prospers.<\/p><p>The post-WWII era and its mainly straightforward distinctions between good and evil, to take an example of the former, yielded a flowering subgenre of movies with morally uncomplicated gunslingers. And 30 years later, the ideological simplicity of the Cold War and its larger-than-life Evil Empire gave rise to the very action movies on which \"Expendables\" is modeled (not to mention the ultimate in us-versus-them confections, \"Rocky IV.\" Yes, there's a Stallone-ishness to all of this). There are plenty of reasons why these types of movies faded from view in the 1990s, but the fall of the Berlin Wall and the the Soviet Union certainly played a part.<\/p><p>The examples are just as abundant on the other side. The ambiguities of the Vietnam War and the counterculture in the late 1960s and early 1970s undoubtedly offered up the moral murkiness of<\/p><p>\"Midnight Cowboy\" and scores of others. In the post-9\/11 world, meanwhile, movies like<\/p><p>-- with its themes of a destruction-bent enemy that can't be bargained with, and the question of what constitutes an acceptable ethical compromise in fighting that enemy -- have captured our imagination. You can throw<\/p><p>in there too, to the degree the movie was a contemplation of Western interests in the Middle East.<\/p><p>Political eras are, of course, rarely just one thing or another, and the movies we want to see in a given period are hardly monolithic. But as tempting as it is to infer that the success of \"The Expendables\" shows a deeper cultural need, it may well be the wrong inference. When times are confusing, we want movies to reflect that confusion, and even to make sense of it. But we probably don't want to pretend that confusion doesn't exist.<\/p><p>Photo: A scene from \"The Expendables.\" Credit: Lionsgate<\/p><p>Stallone: I'm contemplating an \"Expendables\" sequel<\/p><p>Hollywood wonders if Schwarzenegger will be back","552":"The Coworking Resources Series is supported by join.me. Get your people together without actually getting them together. Just instantly share your screen so everybody's on the same page. No need for a plane, a projector or a sandwich platter. Just gather at join.me.<\/p><p>If you've decided that it's time to leave your bathrobe at home, let your favorite coffee shop have its corner table back, and join a coworking space, you're only halfway there. Though coworking can have a lot of perks, how you take advantage of them and shape your experience is up to you.<\/p><p>\"We've had people who within the first week they've kind of immersed themselves [in]to events and socializing with other people here, or they're just here, they do their work, and then they take off,\" says Jeff Park, who manages the Ravenswood Coworking Group in Chicago. \"We know that they come in, but I think for them that's enough for them. They just want to be around other people in a productive environment.\"<\/p><p>Whether you're aiming to be as productive as possible without a lot of socializing or trying to build a strong professional community that you can turn to for resources and support, these five tips can help you get the most out of your coworking experience.<\/p><p>Green Spaces, a coworking space in Tribeca, specializes in environmentally focused businesses. Mountain View-based Cubes & Crayons combines childcare and coworking. WorkBar in Boston is hosted in a 2,500-square-foot space and has separate areas for cafe-like and quieter working styles. Coworking Brooklyn uses a small room that functions as an art gallery by night.<\/p><p>The coworking experience varies drastically depending on which space you're using. Different spaces have different levels of interaction with other workers, formality and general vibe. While some spaces, like Green Spaces and Cubes & Crayons, state their niche upfront, you'll only be able to gauge what the environment is like by dropping in. Most spaces have daily drop-in rates. Try a couple of different spaces to see what works best for you before you commit. You can find a list of space around the world on the Coworking Wiki.<\/p><p>\"See if the people in the space are people who you could go and see every day\u2026if it's not, then go to the next space,\" says Jay Catalan, the co-founder of a coworking space in Vancouver called The Network Hub.<\/p><p>It's less awkward to introduce yourself on the first day than to work alongside someone for months before asking their name. Even if you're not usually outgoing, try to make a special effort for the first week or two when you start in a new coworking space.<\/p><p>\"Just make introductions and it goes a long way\u2026We've had some people they wish they had met sooner because it turns out they did similar lines of work and just talking about it or actually sharing work, it's not something you want to find out when you only have a couple more months left on your project or something,\" Park says.<\/p><p>If you're shy about meeting people, try getting creative (like, for instance, bringing food). Bill Jacobson and Dave Ulrich, who co-founded WorkBar, said that one new coworker at WorkBar Boston showed up with a big box of doughnuts. \"He got to know everybody pretty quick,\" Jacobson says.<\/p><p>Don't stop interacting with your coworkers after you introduce yourself. One of the biggest benefits of coworking is the built-in community of professionals working across different industries.<\/p><p>\"It may not seem directly 'productive' to chat with your coworker for 10 minutes mid-day, but indirectly, it yields greater results than almost anything else you could spend time on,\" says Parker Whitney, office manager for Philadelphia coworking space Independents Hall, though he says, \"Invest in your community by taking (not faking) interest in what its members do, and it will take you with it\u2026The people you've always wanted to know are sitting all around you. Ask questions. Learn. Most importantly, help them when you can.\"<\/p><p>If you are too busy during the workday for water cooler conversation, most coworking spaces host happy hours, seminars or other events that are prime opportunities for learning more about your coworkers.<\/p><p>\"Even when you work for yourself, it's important to realize your limitations,\" says Dave Martorana, a freelance Python & iPhone developer who works at Independents Hall. \"If you're a software developer, you're not necessarily a designer, product manager, or marketer as well. When you work at a coworking space, people with those skills probably work right next to you and are just as interested in building something awesome as you are.\"<\/p><p>While coworking one day, I ended up testing someone's website, getting caught in the crossfire of a music choice showdown, and participating in a raised-hand vote about which suit jacket a fellow coworker should wear to a meeting. Needless to say, the social aspects of coworking \u2014 despite their advantages \u2014 can be extremely distracting.<\/p><p>Which is why out of the 37 productivity tips that I collected for a previous article, this one from Paul Preibisch of B3D Multitech remains my favorite:<\/p><p>\"Rather than standing up from behind your wall of monitors and shouting, 'Can you all shut up?!' you may want to consider, what I call 'The Cone of Silence.' It really works! All you need are a nice pair of headphones, (not earbuds), a wave file that plays 'white noise,' and Windows Media Player set to auto-repeat.\"<\/p><p>The Coworking Resources Series is supported by join.me. Get your people together without actually getting them together. Just instantly share your screen so everybody's on the same page. No need for a plane, a projector or a sandwich platter. Just gather at join.me.<\/p><p>So what exactly is join.me? It's an impromptu meeting space that happens wherever, whenever. It's getting a second or third pair of eyes on your presentation from across the hall or across the continent. It's sharing your screen instantly with anyone or everyone to get stuff done, quickly.

It's a sci-fi showpiece. It's an ultralight carbon-fiber production car. It's a triumph of parts-bin engineering. It's a take-no-prisoners canyon racer. It's a winged chariot of the Malibu \u00fcber-chic. It's a $136,625 (destination included!) commuter car for Silicon Valley moguls.<\/p><p>The hardware, at least, is straightforward. The central passenger shell is a stiff, lightweight carbon-fiber structure. It is bolted to an aluminum skeleton that holds the 7.1-kilowatt-hour lithium-ion battery pack in its spine.<\/p><p>An electric drive section similar to the one in the BMW i3 people pod is bolted to the front, its 131 horsepower electric motor and 2-speed automatic transmission driving the front wheels. The rear power package is sourced from the new Mini; its 3-cylinder, twin-turbocharged 231-horsepower engine drives the rear wheels through a 6-speed automatic transmission.<\/p><p>The multilayered skin is molded thermoplastic that weighs half as much as steel. Other extreme weight-saving measures, including aluminum wiring and chemically hardened ultrathin glass, keep the weight to 3,267 pounds. The long, light doors swing up and forward. From the front, with doors open, the i8 looks as if it's signaling a touchdown.<\/p><p>The interior is compact yet comfortable, though those over 6-foot-2 may need more legroom, and the rear seats are designed for tiny, limber people.<\/p><p>Getting in is a challenge. The sill is wide, the seat is low, and there's a trick: sit sideways, slide butt in, retract legs. Getting out? Imagine climbing from a bathtub without using your hands.<\/p><p>Pick a personality with the driving-mode buttons. \"Comfort\" keeps the car in electric mode to 37 m.p.h., or until you mash the right-side pedal. The eDrive button keeps things electric to 75 m.p.h. or until the battery fades.<\/p><p>Travel range is about 20 miles in E.V. mode, and recharging takes 1.5 hours at 240 volts or four hours at 120. The Eco-Pro button increases electric efficiency 20 percent by softening the motor response and optimizing climate-control settings. I observed gasoline-powered mileage figures from 27 m.p.g. (impatient cornering) to 37 m.p.g. (safe-and-sane commuting).<\/p><p>In the city, the i8 feels silent, solid and intuitive \u2014 the excitement happens outside, as gawkers track its progress.<\/p><p>On Los Angeles's well-used freeways, the Comfort setting leaves some comfort to be desired. Even with the variable dampers at full soft, the i8 bobs its nose like Muhammad Ali in the first rounds. High-performance tires come standard in the United States; European versions get narrower wheels and taller tires for lower drag and a smoother ride.<\/p><p>In Sport mode, the suspension and steering stiffen and the gas engine roars, pops on upshifts and matches revs downshifting into corners. It sounds great, and it should: much of what you hear is a prerecorded soundtrack piped through the sound system.<\/p><p>The i8 feels strong at full power, but the head-snapping response expected from a partly electric powertrain is absent. The i8 takes time to gather itself, with an atavistic vestige of turbo lag.<\/p><p>On the intestinal twists of Mulholland Highway the i8 can be driven with brutal abandon. The brakes are strong, the chassis is as stiff as a bank vault, and there's enough power to reach the next corner presently. BMW claims a 0-to-60 time of 4.2 seconds, and top speed is 155 m.p.h.<\/p><p>The front tires push when going hard into corners, but everything sticks coming out. Even with the stability control off, the i8 resists spinning its tires \u2014 the software ghost is still there, lurking in the machine.<\/p><p>The i8 is complicated and imperfect. A car that will be used for emissions-free commuting should allow people to get in and get out. It rides harshly. The exterior design is too clever \u2014 the layered rear deck whispers \"Your trunk is open.\"<\/p><p>Still, if the i8 represents the future of sports cars, things are looking bright.<\/p><p>A version of this review appears in print on May 11, 2014, on page AU4 of the New York edition with the headline: The Future Will See You Now.

His brother, Larry Pratcher Jr., was ejected from the court room after issuing a string of obscenities.<\/p><p>Kelly's family nodded and clapped, and the victim's father, Landrin Kelly, hugged his wife.<\/p><p>Muriel Pratcher, Pratcher's mother, cried when the verdict was announced, saying, \"Oh my God.\"<\/p><p>\"It was a no-win situation,\" Bernice Moore, Pratcher's grandmother, said outside the courtroom. \"I lost my grandson to prison, Mr. Kelly lost his son forever. We both lost. It's just a tragedy.\"<\/p><p>During the trial, Pratcher's own attorney admitted that the young man fired the four rifle shots that killed Kelly on Aug. 12, 2004 -- two days before the football player was scheduled to move to the University of Oregon on a sports scholarship.<\/p><p>But defense attorney Jonathan Laba argued that Pratcher killed Kelly in a case of mistaken identity. He said that the defendant feared for his life in an unrelated dispute and accidentally shot Kelly as the football player was waiting in a car to give his stepbrother, Brandon Young, a ride home from his girlfriend's house in Richmond's Iron Triangle District.<\/p><p>Laba argued that Pratcher should be convicted of manslaughter because the death was \"a tragic mistake.\"<\/p><p>But prosecutor David Brown told jurors Kelly's death amounted to \"cold-blooded murder,\" because Pratcher was determined to kill someone that night. Brown argued that Pratcher had the opportunity to notice that Kelly was in the car before grabbing the rifle, advancing on the Oldsmobile and opening fire.<\/p><p>\"It's totally unfair for them to say it was premeditated,\" said Pratcher's father, Larry Sr. \"Terrance just came right up; it's impossible for it to be premeditated. It's totally unfair -- my son is not guilty of first degree murder.\"<\/p><p>Pratcher was 15 years old when Kelly was killed and was tried as an adult in Contra Costa County Superior Court. He faces and faces a maximum sentence of 25 years to life.<\/p><p>Kelly died two days before he was to leave for the University of Oregon, where he had a football scholarship and was expected top play safety. His death stunned his hometown of Richmond as well as students, former players and fans at De La Salle in Concord.<\/p><p>Kelly had been named the most valuable player the previous season at De La Salle, where he played linebacker and running back on a team that didn't lose a game in his four years there.<\/p><p>Police arrested Pratcher, whose older brother, Larry Jr., had played youth basketball with Kelly, five days after the killing. Several witnesses placed Pratcher at the crime scene with the rifle, and at least two told investigators they saw him fire into Kelly's car.<\/p><p>Brown offered no motive for the crime but said Pratcher told a friend: \"I had to do what I had to do.\"","556":"Kenneth Ng calls his website a primer for tourists headed to<\/p><p>, but Fodor's it ain't.<\/p><p>The California State University at Northridge professor's site is a one-stop shop for men drawn to the country's sex tourism industry. Dotted with pictures of scantily clad women, the website, BigBabyKenny, advises would-be Johns on the art of negotiating with prostitutes. \"Start with a compliment,\" Ng advises.<\/p><p>Needless to say, Ng's website is causing headaches for Northridge administrators. First publicized by the Los Angeles Daily News, the economics professor's site has drawn a wave of unwelcome attention, forcing administrators to at once criticize its content and defend Ng's right to publish freely on his own time without university resources.<\/p><p>\"Until we find representative evidence that it infringes upon the work he does at the university itself, there's not much we can do about it,\" said Harold Hellenbrand, Northridge's provost.<\/p><p>There may be subtlety in Hellenbrand's words, but his message is clear: If BigBabyKenny infringes on Ng's ability to effectively do his job, then Northridge's position will change. Ng has already said his site is run through a separate server not connected to the university, but Northridge officials might still make a case that the site has interfered with his job. Asked if students complaining that they were no longer comfortable in Ng's class would compel Northridge to demand the site be taken down, Hellenbrand said \"I'm not inviting complaints, but you just hit on the key issue.\"<\/p><p>\"If [running the site is] what he wants to do, and at the same time he wants to educate students and students flock away, then that would create a problem,\" Hellenbrand said.<\/p><p>How Ng came to be identified as the author of BigBabyKenny is a story in itself. A frequent tourist of Thailand, Ng took to blogging on the website of a Bangkok bar called Big Mango Bar. In one controversial post, Ng advised men to seek women near a particular Buddhist shrine.<\/p><p>\"The naysayers will say its creepy to be hanging around the Muariti Shrine, hitting on the emotionally vulnerable girls desperately praying and paying Buddha for a better love life but I beg to differ. Buddha works in mysterious ways,\" he wrote.<\/p><p>Perturbed by the post, the bar owners removed it. That led Ng to start his own site, prompting what Ng describes as a concerted effort by the owners to publicize his penchant for writing about prostitutes. They sent mass e-mails to faculty listed in Northridge's directory, and also posted on RateMyProfessor.com, warning students about Ng, he said.<\/p><p>Ng readily defends the content of his site and says he has no intention of taking it down.<\/p><p>\"The university has no stake in this one way or the other, and besides, professors can say whatever they want,\" said Ng, a tenured associate professor of economics.<\/p><p>Some question whether Ng has crossed a gray legal line, however, by advising men on sex tourism. Patrick Trueman, a former U.S. justice department official, notes that there are several federal statutes that could come into play. Within U.S. Code 18 are two sections \u2013 2422 (a) and 2422 (b) \u2013 that specifically prohibit anyone from \"enticing or coercing a person\" to travel internationally in pursuit of prostitutes. Moreover, one section specifically prohibits the use of the Internet to lure people.<\/p><p>While prostitution may be tolerated in Thailand, that's immaterial under the federal code, Trueman said.<\/p><p>\"Inducing and enticing? Isn't that what this guy's doing?\" said Trueman, former chief of the Justice Department's Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section in the Criminal Division.<\/p><p>Trueman, now a lawyer specializing in sex trafficking and child abuse cases, said there would likely be debate about whether talking about procuring prostitutes online and actually arranging prostitutes for a person should be treated differently under the law.<\/p><p>\"Given how lax the fed government is on these crimes, they may not charge somebody unless they are more directly involved,\" he said. \"That's not to say this person couldn't be charged, and as I read it they could be charged.\"<\/p><p>Beyond the legal implications, critics have already attacked Ng on moral grounds. John Foubert, an Oklahoma State University professor who researches sex trafficking, argues that women \u2013 often minors \u2013 are forced into the sex tourism industry and often have trouble escaping it. Even if Ng is operating within the bounds of the law, Northridge officials have an ethical problem they've yet to face, Foubert said.<\/p><p>\"Do they want to live with the blood on their hands of these girls that are being essentially raped by these men, who are going down and purchasing sex? I think that's a larger question,\" said Foubert, an associate professor of college student development.<\/p><p>Ng said he allows anything to be written on his site, so long as it doesn't involve pedophilia or underage sex. He does, however, write about how difficult it is to effectively negotiate with a \"half or sometimes fully naked teenage girl\" when she's \"expertly gyrating\" on a man's lap.<\/p><p>While his critics have been speaking out since fall, Ng said he has yet to hear from a student who expressed discomfort about his website.<\/p><p>\"The job of the university is to expose students to the world \u2013 not just a politically correct view of the world and not just the good parts of the world,\" he said. \"If a student reads that [site], I personally think it's good for them. They learn about something out there; maybe they disapprove of it and they don't think it's good.\"<\/p><p>You share in the USA TODAY community, so please keep your comments smart and civil.

Ms. Temple said the longer Mr. Akin waited, the more difficult it would get.<\/p><p>The first deadline for Mr. Akin to have easily withdrawn from the race was Tuesday evening. His decision to stay in the race means that he now has only a few weeks to reconsider before things get even harder.<\/p><p>Certification of the presidential ballots in Missouri will be no later than Sept. 17, and could be shortly after President Obama officially accepts the Democratic nomination on Sept. 5.<\/p><p>Once the ballots are printed, any candidate who seeks to withdraw must pay for the reprinting of new ballots. That could be prohibitively expensive for Mr. Akin, but presumably the Republican Party \u2014 which badly wants him to withdraw \u2014 would cover the cost.<\/p><p>Military overseas ballots begin shipping out Sept. 22. That might be the first firm deadline. But the drop-dead deadline is Sept. 25, when general absentee ballots are sent out.<\/p><p>Mel Carnahan, the former Missouri governor and Ms. Carnahan's father, died on Oct. 16, 2000, during his campaign for the Senate against the Republican incumbent, John Ashcroft. Mr. Carnahan's name nonetheless appeared on the ballot in November \u2014 and he won. (His widow, Jean, was appointed to the seat, and lost it in special election in 2002.)<\/p><p>Assuming that Mr. Akin bows to pressure from Republican leaders (or simply concludes that he isn't able to raise enough money to mount a credible campaign), Missouri law requires that he seek a court order allowing him to drop out of the race.<\/p><p>State officials say that issuing such court orders is routine. Mr. Akin would merely have to file the necessary papers with the court and his name would no longer be printed on the November ballot. Republicans could then quickly nominate someone else to run against Senator Claire McCaskill, the Democratic incumbent.<\/p><p>Democrats would no doubt like to see Mr. Akin \u2014 now politically weakened by his comments on rape and pregnancy \u2014 stay in the race. In theory, the Democratic officials who run the state's election offices could object to Mr. Akin's request for a court order, a move that would force a hearing before a judge.<\/p><p>The relevant statute says someone like Mr. Akin can withdraw \"pursuant to a court order, which, except for good cause shown by the election authority in opposition thereto, shall be freely given upon application by the candidate to the circuit court in the county of such candidate's residence.\"<\/p><p>Election officials say they can find no precedent at all for such an objection in the state's history. But Ms. Carnahan is herself a factor in Republican minds. As the Democratic Senate nominee in 2010, she lost to Representative Roy Blunt, and Republicans imagine she could put up a fight.<\/p><p>\"The secretary's job is to protect the rights of Missouri voters,\" Ms. Temple said when asked whether Ms. Carnahan would fight a court order to remove Mr. Akin's name from the ballot.<\/p><p>A further complication: Under state law, any election authority in Missouri can oppose a withdrawal order, down to the county and city level, and there are Democrats aplenty in Missouri. But Ms. Temple added that right now, it would be up to a Missouri court to determine whether Mr. Akin could withdraw, not the secretary of state.<\/p><p>\"It's completely in the hands of the court to decide the facts,\" she said.<\/p><p>Assuming Mr. Akin does manage to drop out, the state central committee of the Republican Party in Missouri would have to pick a new candidate within 28 days, or by Oct. 12, whichever comes first.","558":"A worker sets up a polling station the morning of the GOP primary in Florida. Fewer voters than expected turned out.<\/p><p>Editor's note: John Avlon is a CNN contributor and senior political columnist for Newsweek and The Daily Beast. He is co-editor of the book \"Deadline Artists: America's Greatest Newspaper Columns.\"<\/p><p>(CNN) -- Beneath Rick Santorum's stunning three-state sweep on Tuesday stands another stubborn sign of dissatisfaction with the status quo: Republican turnout is down.<\/p><p>I'm talking embarrassingly, disturbingly, hey-don't-you-know-it's-an-election-year bad. It is a sign of a serious enthusiasm gap among the rank and file, and a particularly bad omen for Mitt Romney and the GOP in the general election.<\/p><p>Here's the tale of the tape, state by state, beginning with Tuesday night: Minnesota had just more than 47,000 people turn out for its caucuses this year -- four years ago it was nearly 63,000 -- and Romney came in first, not a distant third as he did Tuesday night. In Colorado, more than 70,000 people turned out for its caucus in 2008 -- but in 2012 it was 65,000. And Missouri -- even making a generous discount for the fact that this was an entirely symbolic contest -- had 232,000 people turn out, less than half the number who did four years ago.<\/p><p>Even with months of pre-primary hype and attention solely devoted to the Republican field, turnout in this election cycle essentially flat-lined. In Iowa, a little more than 121,000 people voted, compared with nearly 119,000 four years before, when action in the Democratic caucuses absorbed most of the attention.<\/p><p>In New Hampshire, the same dynamic applied -- 245,000 voters turned out in 2012, compared with 241,000 four years before, despite Republicans being the only game in town and independents making up 47% of the total turnout in 2012, according to CNN exit polls. Take out the independent voters and you've got a deep net decline.<\/p><p>Always proudly rebellious, South Carolina has been the great outlier in this election cycle. With Newt Gingrich making an all-out push for conservatives in a conservative state, turnout was up almost 150,000 over four years before.<\/p><p>But in Florida, the decline became unmistakable. Maybe it decreased because the Romney and Gingrich campaigns, plus super PACS, spent more than $18 million in the Sunshine State on TV ads, of which 93% were negative in the last week alone, according to the Campaign Media Analysis Group. After all, negative ads depress turnout. But after all the mud was thrown, 1.6 million people turned out in the nation's fourth largest state, which might sound impressive until you compare it with the nearly 2 million who turned out in 2008.<\/p><p>Nevada was even worse, with 32,894 people turning out to vote in a state with more than 465,000 registered Republicans. Four years before, more than 44,300 participated in the caucus. Turnout was down more than 25% despite the GOP caucuses being the only game in town. Party officials were expecting a turnout of more than 70,000.<\/p><p>All this should be a wake-up call for the GOP. Despite an enormous amount of national media attention devoted to each of the states to date, the response has been a notable yawn among the Republican rank and file.<\/p><p>The turnout numbers are even worse when you compare them with the number of registered Republicans in each state that has voted to date.<\/p><p>The caucuses in particular bring out an unrepresentative sample of a state's Republican Party. For all the grass-roots romanticism, there has got to be a better way to pick a presidential nominee.<\/p><p>But the news is worst for Romney, long the presumptive front-runner in a party that tends to reward the man next in line.<\/p><p>\"Reluctantly Romney\" could be a bumper sticker, even for his supporters. The former Massachusetts governor has found it difficult to climb above 35% in national polls, meaning that a majority of Republicans still support someone else in a notably weak field. His vote margins and totals lag behind those of four years before, when he lost the nomination to John McCain in a crowded and comparatively competent field, although Minnesota is the first state he won in '08 and lost in 2012.<\/p><p>You reap what you sow, and part of the reason turnout is down is directly related to the problem of polarization. The Republican Party is more ideologically polarized than at any time in recent history. Therefore, it put up more purely right-wing candidates than it did four years before, when center-right leaders such as McCain and Rudy Giuliani were also in the race. A bigger tent inspired bigger turnout.<\/p><p>But the other reason is simple dissatisfaction with the candidates.<\/p><p>Republicans seem united in their anger against the president -- like the Democrats in 2004 -- but they are uninspired by their options. Draft movements for fantasy candidates ranging from Chris Christie to Mitch Daniels to Paul Ryan and even Jeb Bush have started and failed. Some party leaders show more enthusiasm for a hypothetical 2016 crop of candidates, including Marco Rubio and Bobby Jindal, than they do for the flawed choices before them in this election. Divided and dispirited is an odd place for the Republican Party to be so soon after the enthusiasms of the 2010 tea party-driven election.<\/p><p>The bottom line is that voter turnout matters. And what should be most troubling for Republicans is that this enthusiasm gap among the conservative base is accompanied by a lack of candidates who might appeal to independents and centrist swing voters in the general election. It is a double barrel of bad news for the Republican Party. The numbers can be spun and rationalized by professional partisan operatives all day long, but the fact remains -- voters just aren't turning out to cast their votes for this crop of conservative candidates in 2012.<\/p><p>Follow CNN Opinion on Twitter.<\/p><p>Join the conversation on Facebook.<\/p><p>The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John Avlon.","559":"9NEWS NSW State Politics reporter Chris O'Keefe has won a Walkley Award.
