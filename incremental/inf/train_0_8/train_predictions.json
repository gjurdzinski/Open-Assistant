Instead, the populace took it out on the Government.<\/p><p>Earlier, Mrs Thatcher had taken a different approach, intervening directly over council overspending by capping the rates. She positioned herself, in effect, as the defender of the people against town hall extravagance. Mr Cameron needs to do something similar: rather than talk about localism, he needs to lay down the law and stop front-line services being cut. It turns out that even the \u00a3800 million he pledged for carers of disabled children is not ring-fenced: it could end up kitting out a councillor's office with plasma screens, and the Government couldn't do a thing.<\/p><p>So rather than moaning about councils' behaviour, why not a slip a clause into the Localism Bill that gives the Government powers to cap salaries at the same level as a Cabinet minister (currently \u00a3134,565)? It would hardly be a vote-loser, even if it doesn't fit in with the theme of devolving power. Town hall chiefs may be earning more than Mr Cameron, but that is no reason to fall at their feet.

The Mexican celebrity magazine TVnotas recently published 25 paparazzi photos of the Rev. Alberto Cuti\u00e9, the popular Miami Beach priest famous for his Spanish-language television and radio talk shows, cavorting amorously on a Florida beach with an attractive woman. Over a three-day period, the pictures also captured him kissing her in a bar. In one of TVnotas's \"in fragranti\" shots [Note to TVnotas copy editors: it's \"in flagrante\"] the woman wraps her legs around Cuti\u00e9; in another, Cuti\u00e9 has a hand down her swimsuit, fondling her rear end.<\/p><p>Because of the scandal, the Archdiocese of Miami says Cuti\u00e9, 40, is no longer the administrator of his Miami Beach parish, and it has barred him from leading Sunday mass there. His media work seems up in the air now, and the popular website padrealberto.net has only a blue screen with a message from Cuti\u00e9 asking forgiveness. (See the 25 most influential evangelicals in America.)<\/p><p>Most Catholics probably don't approve of Cuti\u00c3\u00a9's affair. Still, will they back the archdiocese? Cuti\u00c3\u00a9's punishment is understandable at first glance, at least for his hypocrisy if not for the betrayal of his oath of celibacy. To the Catholic Church, priestly ordination means a marriage vow to the church \u2014 the \"bride of Christ.\" In a statement, Miami Archbishop John Favalora said Cuti\u00c3\u00a9's actions \"cannot be condoned despite the good work he's done as a priest.\" (See pictures of a Catholic congregation fighting to save its church building.)<\/p><p>But Cutie's penalty might elicit more than a few snickers from Catholics who have spent the past few decades watching the priestly perdition parade of sexual abuse, parish embezzlement and doctrinal intolerance. The Miami archdiocese has had to pay out millions of dollars in sexual-abuse settlements in recent years \u2014 including a case involving a former priest at Cuti\u00c3\u00a9's South Beach church, St. Francis de Sales. (One of Cuti\u00c3\u00a9's tasks, in fact, has been to heal the wounds inside that parish.) To his credit, Favalora is trying to restore public trust in his archdiocese and the Church. But so long as Cuti\u00c3\u00a9 wasn't frolicking with a minor (female or male) or using parish funds to buy margaritas for his paramour, many parishioners may actually be relieved that their popular priest has a libido focused on a woman who has reached the age of consent.(Check out a story about the heartthrob of the Vatican.)<\/p><p>What's more, one of the pillars of Cuti\u00c3\u00a9's popularity is his relationship counseling. To any Catholic who's had to suffer through a lecture on marriage from a celibate kid just out of seminary, Cuti\u00c3\u00a9's romantic romp might just make him a more appealing priest \u2014 more human, perhaps, than Catholic clergy who deny communion to divorcees, gays and anyone else who dares violate the Church's litany of \"non-negotiable\" rules. \"He was doing this fairly out in the open,\" notes one Miami Catholic who knows Cuti\u00c3\u00a9 well and has undergone marriage counseling with him. \"Most priests who do this usually try to hide it, but this wasn't some dirty little tryst in the back of the parish residence.

Cuti\u00c3\u00a9's last name is pronounced koo-tee-AY, but that hasn't stopped people from calling the handsome, telegenic priest \"Father Cutie\" \u2014 the kind of hunk-in-a-collar whom smitten Catholic schoolgirls often nickname \"Father What-a-Waste.\" In 1999, when he burst onto the scene just four years after his ordination with his first television talk show on the Spanish-language Telemundo network, Cambia Tu Vida Con Padre Alberto (Change Your Life With Father Alberto), he remarked to the Miami Herald that celibacy is \"a struggle, but it's a good struggle.\"<\/p><p>It was a battle that Cuti\u00c3\u00a9 was perhaps destined to lose, not just because of his good looks but his celebrity. In the chaste, pre-Vatican II culture of the 1950s, no one would have dared wonder if a priestly TV phenom like Bishop Fulton Sheen had a girlfriend. But today, the temptations for an attractive media star, ordained or not, are greater \u2014 especially in the narcissistic Gomorrah of South Beach. And Cuti\u00c3\u00a9 was never a shy altar boy to begin with. Born in Puerto Rico to Cuban parents, he was a popular deejay as a teen, and he still likes disco music and getting buff in the gym.<\/p><p>That's not to say, however, that Cuti\u00e9 is a liberal priest. His current television talk show, Hablando Con Padre Alberto (Talking With Father Alberto), is aired on the conservative Catholic network EWTN (Eternal World Television Network) founded by the engaging but dogmatically stern nun, Mother Angelica. Last December he blasted Playboy's Mexican edition for what he called a \"blasphemous\" cover photo that depicted a model as the Virgin Mary. On his shows on the Radio Paz (Radio Peace) network, and in his columns and books, such as Ama de Verdad, Vive de Verdad (Real Love, Real Life), Cuti\u00e9 usually toes the Vatican's doctrinal line on issues like abortion.<\/p><p>Nonetheless, the Cuti\u00c3\u00a9 scandal is sure to ratchet up debate over clerical celibacy in the Catholic Church, a spiritual ideal that seems to collide more often today with biological reality.

A bigger problem for the Church, however, may be Cuti\u00c3\u00a9's Oprah-like standing in the Latino community \u2014 the only demographic where U.S. Catholicism is experiencing growth. America's Catholic bishops, many of whom are widely accused of allowing the sexual abuse crisis to happen, must realize that Cuti\u00c3\u00a9 is more well regarded among Catholics than they are, especially among Latinos, meaning the hierarchy will probably need to handle the tele-priest's future with special care.<\/p><p>For his part, Cuti\u00e9 said in his statement that \"the commitment I made to serve God will remain intact,\" a vague message that left many of his parishioners wondering if he plans to stay in the priesthood.

And while they may not applaud Cuti\u00e9 for tasting forbidden fruit, they may not condemn him as harshly as the Church thinks they should either.","59":"Los Angeles-based lawyer Patricia Glaser appeared on Fox News's \"Hannity\" last night to advance Rush Limbaugh's case against the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee over the radio host's comments about sexual consent in a Sept. 15 broadcast. \"You can't maliciously attack people, their freedom of speech,\" Glaser told Sean Hannity. \"And you certainly can't put words \u2014 and it's irresponsible to put words in the mouth of someone that were never uttered.\"<\/p><p>With that attack, Glaser summed up a Nov. 6 threat letter that she sent to the DCCC on Limbaugh's behalf. At issue in the spat is a Sept. 17 e-mail blast from the DCCC accusing Limbaugh of \"excusing rape on college campuses\" and saying \"'no' means 'yes' if you know how to spot it.\" The way Limbaugh & Co. see things, that's an out-of-context slam on the radio host, who said all of this:<\/p><p>How many of you guys, in your own experience with women, have learned that 'no' means 'yes' if you know how to spot it? I'm probably \u2014 let me tell you something, in this modern world, that is simply, that's not tolerated. People aren't even going to try to understand that one. I mean, it used to be said as a cliche. Used to be part of the advice young boys were given. See, that's what we've got to change. We have got to reprogram the way we raise men. Permission every step of the way, clearly spelling out 'why.' Are these not lawsuits waiting to happen if even one of these steps is not taken?<\/p><p>Responding to a question from Hannity about Limbaugh's status as a public figure for the purposes of media law, Glaser noted, \"What do I have to demonstrate because he's a public figure? I have to show malice. Could it be any clearer what the malice is? I don't even think I need to explain that to people who are watching the show. It is a deliberate effort to mischaracterize,\" she said. As the Erik Wemple Blog pointed out yesterday, the DCCC had plenty of company in its interpretation of Limbaugh's remarks.<\/p><p>Though Glaser knows the legal issues surrounding Limbaugh's claims, she earns no self-awareness points. By saying \"You can't maliciously attack people,\" Glaser invites comparison with Limbaugh's 2012 offensive against Sandra Fluke, then a Georgetown University law student who had given testimony on Capitol Hill on the importance of contraception coverage in insurance plans. Limbaugh proceeded to hammer her for being a \"slut,\" a \"prostitute\" and many other things.<\/p><p>The Washington Post's Gene Weingarten wrote about Limbaugh's fine appreciation of context in the Fluke case:<\/p><p>All of this bile followed from his assertion that she testified about her own extremely active sex life.<\/p><p>Here's the thing: She didn't. She said nothing whatsoever about her own sex life. She did not mention her own contraceptive needs at all: She spoke passionately and eloquently, and respectfully, about several friends of hers, Georgetown students who she said were diagnosed with medical conditions requiring the birth control pill, but who could not get it because they could not afford it. That was it. Here is the transcript of her testimony.<\/p><p>Following a huge uproar, Limbaugh apologized to Fluke for his \"word choices.\"<\/p><p>Limbaugh & Co., said Glaser, wants the DCCC to make amends: \"We want an apology. We want a retraction. And we want it as broadly disseminated as the irresponsible defamation was broadly disseminated,\" she told Hannity.<\/p><p>As for the Fox News host, he sounded excited about a legal proceeding: \"You know what, it's a serious issue, because I think you're right,\" Hannity said. \"And as somebody that works in this business, this happens all the time. And in this case I believe they so crossed the line. It's going to be very interesting to see this work its way through the courts. I think they're going to be surprised.\"<\/p><p>Erik Wemple writes the Erik Wemple blog, where he reports and opines on media organizations of all sorts.","60":"If only it were the worst thing that a Roman Catholic priest has been caught doing.

It doesn't appear to be just about sex; it's about intimacy, and he's always been able to help people understand which is more important.\"<\/p><p>The attraction of the unidentified woman in the photos to Cuti\u00c3\u00a9 isn't surprising, either. Cuti\u00c3\u00a9's last name is pronounced koo-tee-AY, but that hasn't stopped people from calling the handsome, telegenic priest \"Father Cutie\" \u2014 the kind of hunk-in-a-collar whom smitten Catholic schoolgirls often nickname \"Father What-a-Waste.\" In 1999, when he burst onto the scene just four years after his ordination with his first television talk show on the Spanish-language Telemundo network, Cambia Tu Vida Con Padre Alberto (Change Your Life With Father Alberto), he remarked to the Miami Herald that celibacy is \"a struggle, but it's a good struggle.\"<\/p><p>It was a battle that Cuti\u00c3\u00a9 was perhaps destined to lose, not just because of his good looks but his celebrity. In the chaste, pre-Vatican II culture of the 1950s, no one would have dared wonder if a priestly TV phenom like Bishop Fulton Sheen had a girlfriend. But today, the temptations for an attractive media star, ordained or not, are greater \u2014 especially in the narcissistic Gomorrah of South Beach. And Cuti\u00c3\u00a9 was never a shy altar boy to begin with. Born in Puerto Rico to Cuban parents, he was a popular deejay as a teen, and he still likes disco music and getting buff in the gym.<\/p><p>That's not to say, however, that Cuti\u00e9 is a liberal priest. His current television talk show, Hablando Con Padre Alberto (Talking With Father Alberto), is aired on the conservative Catholic network EWTN (Eternal World Television Network) founded by the engaging but dogmatically stern nun, Mother Angelica. Last December he blasted Playboy's Mexican edition for what he called a \"blasphemous\" cover photo that depicted a model as the Virgin Mary. On his shows on the Radio Paz (Radio Peace) network, and in his columns and books, such as Ama de Verdad, Vive de Verdad (Real Love, Real Life), Cuti\u00e9 usually toes the Vatican's doctrinal line on issues like abortion.<\/p><p>Nonetheless, the Cuti\u00c3\u00a9 scandal is sure to ratchet up debate over clerical celibacy in the Catholic Church, a spiritual ideal that seems to collide more often today with biological reality. (See the recent paternity-suit travails of Paraguayan President Fernando Lugo, who has admitted to fathering a child, and is alleged to have sired others, while he was still a priest.) A bigger problem for the Church, however, may be Cuti\u00c3\u00a9's Oprah-like standing in the Latino community \u2014 the only demographic where U.S. Catholicism is experiencing growth. America's Catholic bishops, many of whom are widely accused of allowing the sexual abuse crisis to happen, must realize that Cuti\u00c3\u00a9 is more well regarded among Catholics than they are, especially among Latinos, meaning the hierarchy will probably need to handle the tele-priest's future with special care.<\/p><p>For his part, Cuti\u00e9 said in his statement that \"the commitment I made to serve God will remain intact,\" a vague message that left many of his parishioners wondering if he plans to stay in the priesthood. Regardless, Cuti\u00e9's Miami Catholic friend notes that the priest, and the Church, need to recognize \"that there's another human being involved in this, the woman in the pictures, and if they're not sensitive to her as well they're looking at double the scandal.\"<\/p><p>In his statement, Favalora said, \"Scandals such as this offer an occasion for the Church on all levels to examine our consciences regarding the integrity of our commitments.\" He's right; but scandals like this also prompt Catholics to more closely and critically examine the battered integrity of their Church. And while they may not applaud Cuti\u00e9 for tasting forbidden fruit, they may not condemn him as harshly as the Church thinks they should either.","70":"Tuesday, August 25, 2015, 12:41 AM<\/p><p>A Kansas man used his dog to beat back a police officer - swinging the poor pooch like a mediaeval mace.<\/p><p>Video shows the moment Michael Rush, 26, allegedly snapped Sunday night, charging at a Park City police officer and then hurling his pint-sized dog at the cop, KSN reported.<\/p><p>\"He was out of it, screaming his head off,\" a neighbor told KSN.<\/p><p>Cops were called after Rush reportedly was spotted walking his dog through several back yards and kicking fences in the quiet suburb north of Wichita.<\/p><p>When an officer with a flashlight confronted Rush, he went into beast mode.<\/p><p>\"I've seen people try to use a dog and sick it on someone, but never seen someone pick one up and swing it through the air and use it as a weapon,\" Park City Police Chief Phil Bostain said. \"That's a first.\"<\/p><p>The man kept coming at the patient officer even after being pepper sprayed and hit with a stun gun, police said.<\/p><p>Rush was subdued after more officers arrived on the scene.<\/p><p>\"I doubt he knew what he was doing,\" the neighbor said.<\/p><p>The black and white dog, which was placed in a local shelter, appeared unharmed while Rush was booked on several charges.<\/p><p>\"Everyone sees a little dog like this - it's defenseless - it's not here by its own choice,\" Bostain told KSN. \"And it's used as a weapon against somebody.

The Mexican celebrity magazine TVnotas recently published 25 paparazzi photos of the Rev. Alberto Cuti\u00e9, the popular Miami Beach priest famous for his Spanish-language television and radio talk shows, cavorting amorously on a Florida beach with an attractive woman. Over a three-day period, the pictures also captured him kissing her in a bar. In one of TVnotas's \"in fragranti\" shots [Note to TVnotas copy editors: it's \"in flagrante\"] the woman wraps her legs around Cuti\u00e9; in another, Cuti\u00e9 has a hand down her swimsuit, fondling her rear end.<\/p><p>Because of the scandal, the Archdiocese of Miami says Cuti\u00e9, 40, is no longer the administrator of his Miami Beach parish, and it has barred him from leading Sunday mass there. His media work seems up in the air now, and the popular website padrealberto.net has only a blue screen with a message from Cuti\u00e9 asking forgiveness. (See the 25 most influential evangelicals in America.)<\/p><p>Most Catholics probably don't approve of Cuti\u00c3\u00a9's affair. Still, will they back the archdiocese? Cuti\u00c3\u00a9's punishment is understandable at first glance, at least for his hypocrisy if not for the betrayal of his oath of celibacy. To the Catholic Church, priestly ordination means a marriage vow to the church \u2014 the \"bride of Christ.\" In a statement, Miami Archbishop John Favalora said Cuti\u00c3\u00a9's actions \"cannot be condoned despite the good work he's done as a priest.\" (See pictures of a Catholic congregation fighting to save its church building.)<\/p><p>But Cutie's penalty might elicit more than a few snickers from Catholics who have spent the past few decades watching the priestly perdition parade of sexual abuse, parish embezzlement and doctrinal intolerance. The Miami archdiocese has had to pay out millions of dollars in sexual-abuse settlements in recent years \u2014 including a case involving a former priest at Cuti\u00c3\u00a9's South Beach church, St. Francis de Sales. (One of Cuti\u00c3\u00a9's tasks, in fact, has been to heal the wounds inside that parish.) To his credit, Favalora is trying to restore public trust in his archdiocese and the Church. But so long as Cuti\u00c3\u00a9 wasn't frolicking with a minor (female or male) or using parish funds to buy margaritas for his paramour, many parishioners may actually be relieved that their popular priest has a libido focused on a woman who has reached the age of consent.(Check out a story about the heartthrob of the Vatican.)<\/p><p>What's more, one of the pillars of Cuti\u00c3\u00a9's popularity is his relationship counseling. To any Catholic who's had to suffer through a lecture on marriage from a celibate kid just out of seminary, Cuti\u00c3\u00a9's romantic romp might just make him a more appealing priest \u2014 more human, perhaps, than Catholic clergy who deny communion to divorcees, gays and anyone else who dares violate the Church's litany of \"non-negotiable\" rules. \"He was doing this fairly out in the open,\" notes one Miami Catholic who knows Cuti\u00c3\u00a9 well and has undergone marriage counseling with him. \"Most priests who do this usually try to hide it, but this wasn't some dirty little tryst in the back of the parish residence. It doesn't appear to be just about sex; it's about intimacy, and he's always been able to help people understand which is more important.\"<\/p><p>The attraction of the unidentified woman in the photos to Cuti\u00c3\u00a9 isn't surprising, either. Cuti\u00c3\u00a9's last name is pronounced koo-tee-AY, but that hasn't stopped people from calling the handsome, telegenic priest \"Father Cutie\" \u2014 the kind of hunk-in-a-collar whom smitten Catholic schoolgirls often nickname \"Father What-a-Waste.\" In 1999, when he burst onto the scene just four years after his ordination with his first television talk show on the Spanish-language Telemundo network, Cambia Tu Vida Con Padre Alberto (Change Your Life With Father Alberto), he remarked to the Miami Herald that celibacy is \"a struggle, but it's a good struggle.\"<\/p><p>It was a battle that Cuti\u00c3\u00a9 was perhaps destined to lose, not just because of his good looks but his celebrity. In the chaste, pre-Vatican II culture of the 1950s, no one would have dared wonder if a priestly TV phenom like Bishop Fulton Sheen had a girlfriend. But today, the temptations for an attractive media star, ordained or not, are greater \u2014 especially in the narcissistic Gomorrah of South Beach. And Cuti\u00c3\u00a9 was never a shy altar boy to begin with. Born in Puerto Rico to Cuban parents, he was a popular deejay as a teen, and he still likes disco music and getting buff in the gym.<\/p><p>That's not to say, however, that Cuti\u00e9 is a liberal priest. His current television talk show, Hablando Con Padre Alberto (Talking With Father Alberto), is aired on the conservative Catholic network EWTN (Eternal World Television Network) founded by the engaging but dogmatically stern nun, Mother Angelica. Last December he blasted Playboy's Mexican edition for what he called a \"blasphemous\" cover photo that depicted a model as the Virgin Mary. On his shows on the Radio Paz (Radio Peace) network, and in his columns and books, such as Ama de Verdad, Vive de Verdad (Real Love, Real Life), Cuti\u00e9 usually toes the Vatican's doctrinal line on issues like abortion.<\/p><p>Nonetheless, the Cuti\u00c3\u00a9 scandal is sure to ratchet up debate over clerical celibacy in the Catholic Church, a spiritual ideal that seems to collide more often today with biological reality. (See the recent paternity-suit travails of Paraguayan President Fernando Lugo, who has admitted to fathering a child, and is alleged to have sired others, while he was still a priest.) A bigger problem for the Church, however, may be Cuti\u00c3\u00a9's Oprah-like standing in the Latino community \u2014 the only demographic where U.S. Catholicism is experiencing growth. America's Catholic bishops, many of whom are widely accused of allowing the sexual abuse crisis to happen, must realize that Cuti\u00c3\u00a9 is more well regarded among Catholics than they are, especially among Latinos, meaning the hierarchy will probably need to handle the tele-priest's future with special care.<\/p><p>For his part, Cuti\u00e9 said in his statement that \"the commitment I made to serve God will remain intact,\" a vague message that left many of his parishioners wondering if he plans to stay in the priesthood. Regardless, Cuti\u00e9's Miami Catholic friend notes that the priest, and the Church, need to recognize \"that there's another human being involved in this, the woman in the pictures, and if they're not sensitive to her as well they're looking at double the scandal.\"<\/p><p>In his statement, Favalora said, \"Scandals such as this offer an occasion for the Church on all levels to examine our consciences regarding the integrity of our commitments.\" He's right; but scandals like this also prompt Catholics to more closely and critically examine the battered integrity of their Church. And while they may not applaud Cuti\u00e9 for tasting forbidden fruit, they may not condemn him as harshly as the Church thinks they should either.","88":"Tuesday, August 25, 2015, 12:41 AM<\/p><p>A Kansas man used his dog to beat back a police officer - swinging the poor pooch like a mediaeval mace.<\/p><p>Video shows the moment Michael Rush, 26, allegedly snapped Sunday night, charging at a Park City police officer and then hurling his pint-sized dog at the cop, KSN reported.<\/p><p>\"He was out of it, screaming his head off,\" a neighbor told KSN.<\/p><p>Cops were called after Rush reportedly was spotted walking his dog through several back yards and kicking fences in the quiet suburb north of Wichita.<\/p><p>When an officer with a flashlight confronted Rush, he went into beast mode.<\/p><p>\"I've seen people try to use a dog and sick it on someone, but never seen someone pick one up and swing it through the air and use it as a weapon,\" Park City Police Chief Phil Bostain said. \"That's a first.\"<\/p><p>The man kept coming at the patient officer even after being pepper sprayed and hit with a stun gun, police said.<\/p><p>Rush was subdued after more officers arrived on the scene.<\/p><p>\"I doubt he knew what he was doing,\" the neighbor said.<\/p><p>The black and white dog, which was placed in a local shelter, appeared unharmed while Rush was booked on several charges.<\/p><p>\"Everyone sees a little dog like this - it's defenseless - it's not here by its own choice,\" Bostain told KSN. \"And it's used as a weapon against somebody.

The Mexican celebrity magazine TVnotas recently published 25 paparazzi photos of the Rev. Alberto Cuti\u00e9, the popular Miami Beach priest famous for his Spanish-language television and radio talk shows, cavorting amorously on a Florida beach with an attractive woman. Over a three-day period, the pictures also captured him kissing her in a bar. In one of TVnotas's \"in fragranti\" shots [Note to TVnotas copy editors: it's \"in flagrante\"] the woman wraps her legs around Cuti\u00e9; in another, Cuti\u00e9 has a hand down her swimsuit, fondling her rear end.<\/p><p>Because of the scandal, the Archdiocese of Miami says Cuti\u00e9, 40, is no longer the administrator of his Miami Beach parish, and it has barred him from leading Sunday mass there. His media work seems up in the air now, and the popular website padrealberto.net has only a blue screen with a message from Cuti\u00e9 asking forgiveness. (See the 25 most influential evangelicals in America.)<\/p><p>Most Catholics probably don't approve of Cuti\u00c3\u00a9's affair. Still, will they back the archdiocese? Cuti\u00c3\u00a9's punishment is understandable at first glance, at least for his hypocrisy if not for the betrayal of his oath of celibacy. To the Catholic Church, priestly ordination means a marriage vow to the church \u2014 the \"bride of Christ.\" In a statement, Miami Archbishop John Favalora said Cuti\u00c3\u00a9's actions \"cannot be condoned despite the good work he's done as a priest.\" (See pictures of a Catholic congregation fighting to save its church building.)<\/p><p>But Cutie's penalty might elicit more than a few snickers from Catholics who have spent the past few decades watching the priestly perdition parade of sexual abuse, parish embezzlement and doctrinal intolerance. The Miami archdiocese has had to pay out millions of dollars in sexual-abuse settlements in recent years \u2014 including a case involving a former priest at Cuti\u00c3\u00a9's South Beach church, St. Francis de Sales. (One of Cuti\u00c3\u00a9's tasks, in fact, has been to heal the wounds inside that parish.) To his credit, Favalora is trying to restore public trust in his archdiocese and the Church. But so long as Cuti\u00c3\u00a9 wasn't frolicking with a minor (female or male) or using parish funds to buy margaritas for his paramour, many parishioners may actually be relieved that their popular priest has a libido focused on a woman who has reached the age of consent.(Check out a story about the heartthrob of the Vatican.)<\/p><p>What's more, one of the pillars of Cuti\u00c3\u00a9's popularity is his relationship counseling. To any Catholic who's had to suffer through a lecture on marriage from a celibate kid just out of seminary, Cuti\u00c3\u00a9's romantic romp might just make him a more appealing priest \u2014 more human, perhaps, than Catholic clergy who deny communion to divorcees, gays and anyone else who dares violate the Church's litany of \"non-negotiable\" rules. \"He was doing this fairly out in the open,\" notes one Miami Catholic who knows Cuti\u00c3\u00a9 well and has undergone marriage counseling with him. \"Most priests who do this usually try to hide it, but this wasn't some dirty little tryst in the back of the parish residence. It doesn't appear to be just about sex; it's about intimacy, and he's always been able to help people understand which is more important.\"<\/p><p>The attraction of the unidentified woman in the photos to Cuti\u00c3\u00a9 isn't surprising, either. Cuti\u00c3\u00a9's last name is pronounced koo-tee-AY, but that hasn't stopped people from calling the handsome, telegenic priest \"Father Cutie\" \u2014 the kind of hunk-in-a-collar whom smitten Catholic schoolgirls often nickname \"Father What-a-Waste.\" In 1999, when he burst onto the scene just four years after his ordination with his first television talk show on the Spanish-language Telemundo network, Cambia Tu Vida Con Padre Alberto (Change Your Life With Father Alberto), he remarked to the Miami Herald that celibacy is \"a struggle, but it's a good struggle.\"<\/p><p>It was a battle that Cuti\u00c3\u00a9 was perhaps destined to lose, not just because of his good looks but his celebrity. In the chaste, pre-Vatican II culture of the 1950s, no one would have dared wonder if a priestly TV phenom like Bishop Fulton Sheen had a girlfriend. But today, the temptations for an attractive media star, ordained or not, are greater \u2014 especially in the narcissistic Gomorrah of South Beach. And Cuti\u00c3\u00a9 was never a shy altar boy to begin with. Born in Puerto Rico to Cuban parents, he was a popular deejay as a teen, and he still likes disco music and getting buff in the gym.<\/p><p>That's not to say, however, that Cuti\u00e9 is a liberal priest. His current television talk show, Hablando Con Padre Alberto (Talking With Father Alberto), is aired on the conservative Catholic network EWTN (Eternal World Television Network) founded by the engaging but dogmatically stern nun, Mother Angelica. Last December he blasted Playboy's Mexican edition for what he called a \"blasphemous\" cover photo that depicted a model as the Virgin Mary. On his shows on the Radio Paz (Radio Peace) network, and in his columns and books, such as Ama de Verdad, Vive de Verdad (Real Love, Real Life), Cuti\u00e9 usually toes the Vatican's doctrinal line on issues like abortion.<\/p><p>Nonetheless, the Cuti\u00c3\u00a9 scandal is sure to ratchet up debate over clerical celibacy in the Catholic Church, a spiritual ideal that seems to collide more often today with biological reality. (See the recent paternity-suit travails of Paraguayan President Fernando Lugo, who has admitted to fathering a child, and is alleged to have sired others, while he was still a priest.) A bigger problem for the Church, however, may be Cuti\u00c3\u00a9's Oprah-like standing in the Latino community \u2014 the only demographic where U.S. Catholicism is experiencing growth. America's Catholic bishops, many of whom are widely accused of allowing the sexual abuse crisis to happen, must realize that Cuti\u00c3\u00a9 is more well regarded among Catholics than they are, especially among Latinos, meaning the hierarchy will probably need to handle the tele-priest's future with special care.<\/p><p>For his part, Cuti\u00e9 said in his statement that \"the commitment I made to serve God will remain intact,\" a vague message that left many of his parishioners wondering if he plans to stay in the priesthood. Regardless, Cuti\u00e9's Miami Catholic friend notes that the priest, and the Church, need to recognize \"that there's another human being involved in this, the woman in the pictures, and if they're not sensitive to her as well they're looking at double the scandal.\"<\/p><p>In his statement, Favalora said, \"Scandals such as this offer an occasion for the Church on all levels to examine our consciences regarding the integrity of our commitments.\" He's right; but scandals like this also prompt Catholics to more closely and critically examine the battered integrity of their Church. And while they may not applaud Cuti\u00e9 for tasting forbidden fruit, they may not condemn him as harshly as the Church thinks they should either.","94":"Tuesday, August 25, 2015, 12:41 AM<\/p><p>A Kansas man used his dog to beat back a police officer - swinging the poor pooch like a mediaeval mace.<\/p><p>Video shows the moment Michael Rush, 26, allegedly snapped Sunday night, charging at a Park City police officer and then hurling his pint-sized dog at the cop, KSN reported.<\/p><p>\"He was out of it, screaming his head off,\" a neighbor told KSN.<\/p><p>Cops were called after Rush reportedly was spotted walking his dog through several back yards and kicking fences in the quiet suburb north of Wichita.<\/p><p>When an officer with a flashlight confronted Rush, he went into beast mode.<\/p><p>\"I've seen people try to use a dog and sick it on someone, but never seen someone pick one up and swing it through the air and use it as a weapon,\" Park City Police Chief Phil Bostain said. \"That's a first.\"<\/p><p>The man kept coming at the patient officer even after being pepper sprayed and hit with a stun gun, police said.<\/p><p>Rush was subdued after more officers arrived on the scene.<\/p><p>\"I doubt he knew what he was doing,\" the neighbor said.<\/p><p>The black and white dog, which was placed in a local shelter, appeared unharmed while Rush was booked on several charges.<\/p><p>\"Everyone sees a little dog like this - it's defenseless - it's not here by its own choice,\" Bostain told KSN. \"And it's used as a weapon against somebody.

The Mexican celebrity magazine TVnotas recently published 25 paparazzi photos of the Rev. Alberto Cuti\u00e9, the popular Miami Beach priest famous for his Spanish-language television and radio talk shows, cavorting amorously on a Florida beach with an attractive woman. Over a three-day period, the pictures also captured him kissing her in a bar. In one of TVnotas's \"in fragranti\" shots [Note to TVnotas copy editors: it's \"in flagrante\"] the woman wraps her legs around Cuti\u00e9; in another, Cuti\u00e9 has a hand down her swimsuit, fondling her rear end.<\/p><p>Because of the scandal, the Archdiocese of Miami says Cuti\u00e9, 40, is no longer the administrator of his Miami Beach parish, and it has barred him from leading Sunday mass there. His media work seems up in the air now, and the popular website padrealberto.net has only a blue screen with a message from Cuti\u00e9 asking forgiveness. (See the 25 most influential evangelicals in America.)<\/p><p>Most Catholics probably don't approve of Cuti\u00c3\u00a9's affair. Still, will they back the archdiocese? Cuti\u00c3\u00a9's punishment is understandable at first glance, at least for his hypocrisy if not for the betrayal of his oath of celibacy. To the Catholic Church, priestly ordination means a marriage vow to the church \u2014 the \"bride of Christ.\" In a statement, Miami Archbishop John Favalora said Cuti\u00c3\u00a9's actions \"cannot be condoned despite the good work he's done as a priest.\" (See pictures of a Catholic congregation fighting to save its church building.)<\/p><p>But Cutie's penalty might elicit more than a few snickers from Catholics who have spent the past few decades watching the priestly perdition parade of sexual abuse, parish embezzlement and doctrinal intolerance. The Miami archdiocese has had to pay out millions of dollars in sexual-abuse settlements in recent years \u2014 including a case involving a former priest at Cuti\u00c3\u00a9's South Beach church, St. Francis de Sales. (One of Cuti\u00c3\u00a9's tasks, in fact, has been to heal the wounds inside that parish.) To his credit, Favalora is trying to restore public trust in his archdiocese and the Church. But so long as Cuti\u00c3\u00a9 wasn't frolicking with a minor (female or male) or using parish funds to buy margaritas for his paramour, many parishioners may actually be relieved that their popular priest has a libido focused on a woman who has reached the age of consent.(Check out a story about the heartthrob of the Vatican.)<\/p><p>What's more, one of the pillars of Cuti\u00c3\u00a9's popularity is his relationship counseling. To any Catholic who's had to suffer through a lecture on marriage from a celibate kid just out of seminary, Cuti\u00c3\u00a9's romantic romp might just make him a more appealing priest \u2014 more human, perhaps, than Catholic clergy who deny communion to divorcees, gays and anyone else who dares violate the Church's litany of \"non-negotiable\" rules. \"He was doing this fairly out in the open,\" notes one Miami Catholic who knows Cuti\u00c3\u00a9 well and has undergone marriage counseling with him. \"Most priests who do this usually try to hide it, but this wasn't some dirty little tryst in the back of the parish residence. It doesn't appear to be just about sex; it's about intimacy, and he's always been able to help people understand which is more important.\"<\/p><p>The attraction of the unidentified woman in the photos to Cuti\u00c3\u00a9 isn't surprising, either. Cuti\u00c3\u00a9's last name is pronounced koo-tee-AY, but that hasn't stopped people from calling the handsome, telegenic priest \"Father Cutie\" \u2014 the kind of hunk-in-a-collar whom smitten Catholic schoolgirls often nickname \"Father What-a-Waste.\" In 1999, when he burst onto the scene just four years after his ordination with his first television talk show on the Spanish-language Telemundo network, Cambia Tu Vida Con Padre Alberto (Change Your Life With Father Alberto), he remarked to the Miami Herald that celibacy is \"a struggle, but it's a good struggle.\"<\/p><p>It was a battle that Cuti\u00c3\u00a9 was perhaps destined to lose, not just because of his good looks but his celebrity. In the chaste, pre-Vatican II culture of the 1950s, no one would have dared wonder if a priestly TV phenom like Bishop Fulton Sheen had a girlfriend. But today, the temptations for an attractive media star, ordained or not, are greater \u2014 especially in the narcissistic Gomorrah of South Beach. And Cuti\u00c3\u00a9 was never a shy altar boy to begin with. Born in Puerto Rico to Cuban parents, he was a popular deejay as a teen, and he still likes disco music and getting buff in the gym.<\/p><p>That's not to say, however, that Cuti\u00e9 is a liberal priest. His current television talk show, Hablando Con Padre Alberto (Talking With Father Alberto), is aired on the conservative Catholic network EWTN (Eternal World Television Network) founded by the engaging but dogmatically stern nun, Mother Angelica. Last December he blasted Playboy's Mexican edition for what he called a \"blasphemous\" cover photo that depicted a model as the Virgin Mary. On his shows on the Radio Paz (Radio Peace) network, and in his columns and books, such as Ama de Verdad, Vive de Verdad (Real Love, Real Life), Cuti\u00e9 usually toes the Vatican's doctrinal line on issues like abortion.<\/p><p>Nonetheless, the Cuti\u00c3\u00a9 scandal is sure to ratchet up debate over clerical celibacy in the Catholic Church, a spiritual ideal that seems to collide more often today with biological reality. (See the recent paternity-suit travails of Paraguayan President Fernando Lugo, who has admitted to fathering a child, and is alleged to have sired others, while he was still a priest.) A bigger problem for the Church, however, may be Cuti\u00c3\u00a9's Oprah-like standing in the Latino community \u2014 the only demographic where U.S. Catholicism is experiencing growth. America's Catholic bishops, many of whom are widely accused of allowing the sexual abuse crisis to happen, must realize that Cuti\u00c3\u00a9 is more well regarded among Catholics than they are, especially among Latinos, meaning the hierarchy will probably need to handle the tele-priest's future with special care.<\/p><p>For his part, Cuti\u00e9 said in his statement that \"the commitment I made to serve God will remain intact,\" a vague message that left many of his parishioners wondering if he plans to stay in the priesthood. Regardless, Cuti\u00e9's Miami Catholic friend notes that the priest, and the Church, need to recognize \"that there's another human being involved in this, the woman in the pictures, and if they're not sensitive to her as well they're looking at double the scandal.\"<\/p><p>In his statement, Favalora said, \"Scandals such as this offer an occasion for the Church on all levels to examine our consciences regarding the integrity of our commitments.\" He's right; but scandals like this also prompt Catholics to more closely and critically examine the battered integrity of their Church. And while they may not applaud Cuti\u00e9 for tasting forbidden fruit, they may not condemn him as harshly as the Church thinks they should either.","105":"Los Angeles-based lawyer Patricia Glaser appeared on Fox News's \"Hannity\" last night to advance Rush Limbaugh's case against the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee over the radio host's comments about sexual consent in a Sept. 15 broadcast. \"You can't maliciously attack people, their freedom of speech,\" Glaser told Sean Hannity. \"And you certainly can't put words \u2014 and it's irresponsible to put words in the mouth of someone that were never uttered.\"<\/p><p>With that attack, Glaser summed up a Nov. 6 threat letter that she sent to the DCCC on Limbaugh's behalf.

At issue in the spat is a Sept. 17 e-mail blast from the DCCC accusing Limbaugh of \"excusing rape on college campuses\" and saying \"'no' means 'yes' if you know how to spot it.\" The way Limbaugh & Co. see things, that's an out-of-context slam on the radio host, who said all of this:<\/p><p>How many of you guys, in your own experience with women, have learned that 'no' means 'yes' if you know how to spot it? I'm probably \u2014 let me tell you something, in this modern world, that is simply, that's not tolerated. People aren't even going to try to understand that one. I mean, it used to be said as a cliche. Used to be part of the advice young boys were given. See, that's what we've got to change. We have got to reprogram the way we raise men. Permission every step of the way, clearly spelling out 'why.' Are these not lawsuits waiting to happen if even one of these steps is not taken?<\/p><p>Responding to a question from Hannity about Limbaugh's status as a public figure for the purposes of media law, Glaser noted, \"What do I have to demonstrate because he's a public figure? I have to show malice. Could it be any clearer what the malice is? I don't even think I need to explain that to people who are watching the show. It is a deliberate effort to mischaracterize,\" she said. As the Erik Wemple Blog pointed out yesterday, the DCCC had plenty of company in its interpretation of Limbaugh's remarks.<\/p><p>Though Glaser knows the legal issues surrounding Limbaugh's claims, she earns no self-awareness points. By saying \"You can't maliciously attack people,\" Glaser invites comparison with Limbaugh's 2012 offensive against Sandra Fluke, then a Georgetown University law student who had given testimony on Capitol Hill on the importance of contraception coverage in insurance plans. Limbaugh proceeded to hammer her for being a \"slut,\" a \"prostitute\" and many other things.<\/p><p>The Washington Post's Gene Weingarten wrote about Limbaugh's fine appreciation of context in the Fluke case:<\/p><p>All of this bile followed from his assertion that she testified about her own extremely active sex life.<\/p><p>Here's the thing: She didn't. She said nothing whatsoever about her own sex life. She did not mention her own contraceptive needs at all: She spoke passionately and eloquently, and respectfully, about several friends of hers, Georgetown students who she said were diagnosed with medical conditions requiring the birth control pill, but who could not get it because they could not afford it. That was it. Here is the transcript of her testimony.<\/p><p>Following a huge uproar, Limbaugh apologized to Fluke for his \"word choices.\"<\/p><p>Limbaugh & Co., said Glaser, wants the DCCC to make amends: \"We want an apology. We want a retraction. And we want it as broadly disseminated as the irresponsible defamation was broadly disseminated,\" she told Hannity.<\/p><p>As for the Fox News host, he sounded excited about a legal proceeding: \"You know what, it's a serious issue, because I think you're right,\" Hannity said. \"And as somebody that works in this business, this happens all the time. And in this case I believe they so crossed the line. It's going to be very interesting to see this work its way through the courts.

But at a closed-door breakfast fundraiser here Monday, the first question from a donor had nothing to do with Ernst's Senate campaign.<\/p><p>\"When you get elected to the Senate, your job should be to convince Mitt Romney to run for president again,\" a donor told Ernst, according to several attendees. The Republican candidate said she would, while Romney laughed.<\/p><p>When Romney and Ernst gathered in a West Des Moines boardroom with about 40 agriculture executives Sunday night, one businessman after another pleaded with Romney to give the White House another shot.<\/p><p>And at a rally for Ernst in Cedar Rapids on Monday, the state legislator who introduced Romney said, \"If his address was 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, I would sleep a lot better.\" After Romney and Ernst finished speaking, some activists chanted, \"Run, Mitt, run!\"<\/p><p>Romney, the 2012 GOP presidential nominee and now the tacit head of the Republican Party, visited Iowa as part of a feverish nationwide tour designed to help the GOP take control of the Senate. He has insisted that he is not interested in running for president a third time. But his friends said a flurry of behind-the-scenes activity is nudging him to more seriously consider it.<\/p><p>Former presidential candidate Mitt Romney is hitting the stump for Republicans this fall -- which reminded us of some of his most memorable moments during the 2012 campaign. Here's a look at some of Romney's worst gaffes and a few predictions he got right. (Julie Percha\/The Washington Post)<\/p><p>Romney has huddled with prominent donors and reconnected with supporters in key states in recent months. Because of the vacuum of power within his party and the lack of a clear 2016 front-runner, confidants said Romney is grappling with this question: If drafted, would he answer the party's call?<\/p><p>Further juicing the speculation was a Des Moines Register-Bloomberg News poll released over the weekend showing that Romney is the only potential 2016 candidate who would beat Hillary Rodham Clinton (D) among likely Iowa voters, 44 percent to 43 percent.<\/p><p>People in Romney's vast political orbit who are waiting and wishing on him to launch another campaign said Romney has done little to quiet them and has been hazy about his plans following next month's midterm elections.<\/p><p>Former Minnesota governor Tim Pawlenty (R), who briefly ran against Romney in 2012 before becoming a close ally, said he wants to see Romney give it another go.<\/p><p>\"There is a feeling that the country missed out on an exceptional president,\" Pawlenty said. \"If he runs, I believe he could win the nomination and the general election. It'd be the right person at the right time, and I would encourage him to do it.\"<\/p><p>Pawlenty noted that Ronald Reagan ran unsuccessfully for president twice before being elected in his third attempt \"and was stronger for it.\" In contrast with Romney, Pawlenty said, \"the emerging class of Republican candidates is untested and unproven.\"<\/p><p>Within Romney's political network, there has been informal chatter about a third run since early 2013, according to people familiar with the discussions. It bubbled up in phone calls and at dinners and has gained steam this year. Requests continue to pour in for him to appear on the campaign trail, and advisers said he is eager to mount a multi-state fly-around swing before Nov. 4.<\/p><p>In Iowa, however, Romney seemed uncomfortable with the 2016 talk. At the West Des Moines rally, he spoke for only five minutes, criticizing President Obama on income inequality, foreign affairs and other issues. When reporters tried to question him afterward, he sneaked into a dark maze of cubicles.<\/p><p>He also said that now that he was no longer a candidate, he had a joke to share involving Obama, golfer Phil Mickelson and tennis great Andre Agassi.<\/p><p>As Romney told it, Obama shows up at a bank to cash a check without his ID. The teller asks him to prove who he is, saying that Mickelson proved his identity by hitting a golf ball into a cup and Agassi proved his by hitting a tennis ball at a target. \"Is there anything you can do to prove who you are?\" the teller asks.<\/p><p>\"I don't have a clue,\" Obama replies in the joke.<\/p><p>The crowd ate it up.<\/p><p>Former aides and senior Republicans say Romney appreciates the GOP masses crowing that he was right about issues such as Russia and health care. But what really intrigues him, they said, are the vulnerabilities among top-tier candidates in the Republican field. If Romney moves toward a race, it would be because he sees a path to victory.<\/p><p>\"It's the market pulling him,\" said Kent Lucken, a longtime friend and adviser who accompanied Romney to Iowa. \"People look at Hillary as the likely Democratic nominee, and the party needs a strong leader who can stand up to her and who's been through the process.\"<\/p><p>Romney is returning to Boston on Tuesday for a dinner that he and his wife, Ann, are hosting for former campaign advisers and business associates. The event \u2014 to benefit neurological research at Brigham and Women's Hospital \u2014 has Romney intimates abuzz.<\/p><p>Save-the-date notices have gone out for the third annual Romney policy retreat in Park City, Utah, in June 2015 \u2014 a signal that he wants a platform to promote his issues as the presidential primary campaign season gets underway.<\/p><p>Romney is also mingling privately with top donors who could fund a third campaign. Romney visited Sept. 23 with Joe Ricketts, a billionaire investor who finances the Ending Spending super PAC, at Ricketts's palatial penthouse apartment covering the entire 78th floor of the Time Warner Center in New York.<\/p><p>On Oct. 6, Romney also took part in a GOP fundraising dinner at the Manhattan apartment of Woody Johnson, the New York Jets owner and former Romney campaign finance chairman. Several 2016 hopefuls gave presentations to the donors, while Romney served as a co-host and made no pitch.<\/p><p>At Johnson's home, Romney and media magnate Rupert Murdoch spoke about Romney's political future. According to two Romney allies familiar with the conversation, Romney was cagey with Murdoch but expressed concerns about the developing GOP field. Romney told Murdoch that he felt uneasy about the party's non-interventionist drift on foreign policy and the base's embrace of ideological hard-liners.<\/p><p>Many Romney boosters believe that his window of opportunity will be in mid- to late 2015, should Sens. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) or Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) ascend and party establishment types turn to Romney as a savior.<\/p><p>If former Florida governor Jeb Bush (R) opts out of a campaign, \"there is going to be more pressure on Mitt to go,\" said Tom Rath, an influential New Hampshire Republican.<\/p><p>At a luncheon this month in Atlanta to help GOP Senate nominee David Perdue, \"people sat up and paid attention\" to Romney, said Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.). \"I pulled him aside afterward to thank him for coming. He said he's not running, and I take him at his word. But I don't think the door is entirely closed, and circumstances can change.\"<\/p><p>That phrase \u2014 \"circumstances can change\" \u2014 has been repeated by many Romney backers since the former nominee used it to describe his own thinking about 2016 in a radio interview last month with Hugh Hewitt.<\/p><p>Spencer Zwick, Romney's former national finance chairman, talks regularly with Romney and said he has been receiving daily calls from donors and other supporters. \"There are still plenty of donors who hope circumstances will change and there will be an opportunity for Romney to run again,\" he said.<\/p><p>Zwick is part of a slimmed-down inner circle, including longtime advisers Beth Myers, Peter Flaherty, Stuart Stevens, Lanhee Chen and aides Kelli Harrison and Matt Waldrip, who are advising Romney on political activities this fall.<\/p><p>Romney traveled through Iowa with three trusted advisers and friends: David Kochel, Ron Kaufman and Lucken. He also reunited with supporters from campaigns past. In Cedar Rapids, Romney spotted Jim Wilson, a Virginia man who logged more than 40,000 miles chasing the GOP nominee from coast to coast in his campaign-festooned GMC pickup. The two hugged. \"You son of a gun,\" Romney said.<\/p><p>Another fan, Gary Chidester, 64, came to the West Des Moines rally with a full coterie of Romney paraphernalia for the former candidate to autograph: campaign placards, enlarged photographs and buttons of Mitt and wife Ann, and paperback and audio copies of Romney's book \"No Apology.\" He also held a framed drawing that a friend gave him of a black cruise ship named Obama sinking into the sea and a white ship named Romney with the caption, \"We're here to save you.\"<\/p><p>\"He's the only qualified person to run this time,\" Chidester said. \"Mitt is a business genius. That's why I've listened to this tape three times. He had it all down \u2014 he had Russia down, he had the debt down \u2014 and all the other Republicans are novices by comparison.\"","116":"A federal judge Friday denied a Native American tribe's request for a temporary restraining order to halt construction on the controversial Dakota Access Pipeline.

My bad; I forgot that society no longer has common sense.<\/p><p>6 years ago my brother was found dead in his apartment. The only explanation the coroner gave my family was that his heart \"just stopped\", and it was most likely due to the fact that he had been drinking what you call \"energy cocktails\" with friends the night before (red bull and vodka). Drinking these things doesnt just affect your decision making skills, or cause anxiety disorders, IT CAN KILL YOU.<\/p><p>PLEASE, everybody who reads this, remember uppers and downers DO NOT MIX<\/p><p>Why? This trend has happened in the past too with other stimulants. Stimulants with depressants have a synergistic effect in some cases trippling the effect of one or the other which can have deadly consequences. The people using these combinations, one need to grow up and stop mixing drinks like little kids at a coolaid party and two wake up before they cannot wake up...they mix drinks for attention and some mystical edge that those flakes think they get from mixing energy drinks and alcohol....sad.<\/p><p>Energy drinks are disgusting. Why would anyone mix them with alcohol?<\/p><p>When i was in college we would routinly drink all night long taking caffine pills through out to stay up. Its a lot of fun, I had such good times in college, I miss it. We would also inhale aerosol room deoderizers. That just made you kinda pass out and fall down, so not as much fun. I found that if I drank all night with the caffine pills I could smoke a one hitter just before going to sleep and I wouldnt have a hangover when I woke up. I could start the process over when I woke up. I did this 5-6 nights a week on average. I graduated with a 3.4 gpa and now I have a great job making 93k per year. So there really isnt any harm in this behavior.<\/p><p>Another misleading study. Forget that the people that drink energy drinks and alcohol together are just more riskier. Its the caffeine and alcohol combination that makes them morons. God forbid they are morons without the combination of the two.<\/p><p>alcohol + energy drinks = a great time!<\/p><p>Alcohol must be necessary to cut the awful taste of the energy drinks.<\/p><p>One major flaw in this study. Are the people who partake in this risky behaviour, including mixing caffiene and alcohol, more prone to this type of behaviour to begin with?<\/p><p>As a former \"cherry bomb\", vodka-red bull, and jager-bomb drinker, I can appreciate the feeling you get when you drink caffiene and liquor. I never did anything extra risky when clubing and drinking these beverages. I also am not prone to risky behaviour other than the rare binge drinking.<\/p><p>Gee what do you know... more things that are bad for you!! What a bogus study. Too much of anything harmful to your body is going to do damage. I for one love the combo but only in moderation. Risky behavior... Give me a break! Driving your car or even going to a party or club is \"risky\" behavior. With all the sickos in the world today, no one is ever safe. Always be aware of your surroundings and always in moderation.<\/p><p>This article reminded me that I had a 5 hr energy drink in my computer bag. Thanks! that just saved my afternoon.<\/p><p>Also, I drank 2 \u2013 5hr energies at a party last weekend and had a blast. Caffeine is what makes the world go round and alcohol makes the world a cooler place. So if my logic is correct the two combined are a match made in heaven. Drink on!<\/p><p>Red bull and vodka is the modern, legal, \"speedball,\" and we all know that caffeine + liquor simply equals a wide-awake drunk.<\/p><p>So how is this riskier than just getting drunk and then trying to sober up by drinking black coffee?<\/p><p>I agree with everyone who says that vodka plus Red Bull is just legal crack.<\/p><p>We might as well give up on the War on Drugs right now.<\/p><p>It's pointless to spend billions of dollars on fighting the cocaine cartels when you can just add vodka to Red Bull and get the same effect and the same damage to society from the perpetual overdoers.<\/p><p>Nothing new \u2013 someone once thought it was 'fun' to mix barbituates with stimulants. The fact remains, risk increases, not decreases.<\/p><p>It's always interesting to hear from those who justify questionable activity, whether or not it has been definitively determined to be risky. It usually begins with the phrase '...I like..', as if the ends, the effect, justifies the means, the unknown mixture, regardless of the actual risks, usually unknown.<\/p><p>Well, some people like pit bulls, some like shooting AK's at wildlife, some like driving SUV's like sports cars, but, none of those are conducive to low risk, great decisions or desirable behavior.<\/p><p>The operative word here is MAY. This is not a definitive study and, therefore, any conclusions are not empirical.<\/p><p>Two of the worst hangovers I have ever had were the result of just 2 or 3 vodka-redbulls... No thanks, no more, that cured me.<\/p><p>This indicates a link to Anxiety and Manic Depressive behavior.<\/p><p>I used to drink energy drinks to help recover from the previous night. I then discovered that the energy drinks + alcohol were less expensive than plain energy drinks (go figure). These became my first drinks of the day...I am now in 12 step recovery.<\/p><p>Who wants to live low risk their whole life? The entire USA is a country of risk\/pain\/consequence averse cowards. Im surprised the Amish dont take over the country. They probably would if it werent for the language barrier.<\/p><p>\"So there really isn't any harm in this behavior.\" \u2013<\/p><p>You're an ignorant piece of trash, please die.<\/p><p>Ok, enough with people being all judgmental and comparing redbull and vodka to a freaking SPEEDBALL of heroin and cocaine. Um, not even close people. How many of you out there take your doctor-prescribed anti-anxiety pills with your morning coffee? Same thing.<\/p><p>And to the person who said \"pit bulls... [not] conducive to low risk, great decisions or desirable behavior\" I have a pitbull. They are VERY loving and loyal dogs. Even a poodle who is raised wrong can cause great injury to a person. I think it's irresponsible to use owning a pitbull to try and make a point about reckless behavior. You are just spreading the hate. ANY dog raised in a sick environment can turn out dangerous.<\/p><p>Sometimes I will have an energy beer, or do some various 'bomb' containing redbull and something 80-proof. Obviously when you're hyper and drunk, you might do stupid things. When you're drunk and tired, you might also do stupid things. I wish doctors and researchers would find a cure for cancer and AIDS and stop 'researching' all of these common sense things! Ridiculous.<\/p><p>I like to start the night off with a energydrink and vodka mix. one or two to get me going and then I switch to beer. I have been doing this for years and have not noticed any problems with health or risk taking.<\/p><p>Taste Great, but yeah uppers + downers is a bad idea<\/p><p>To Poppy, I think I went to college with you and was perhaps involved in the debauchery...but don't make nearly what you make, and not everyone is as lucky as you, or dodges as many life bullets as you have. word.<\/p><p>I am sorry to read the post about the brother who passed away, possibly related to the mixture of energy drinks and alcohol.

Unless I'm at a party I don't ever drink (doesn't entice me) . Maybe as a product of my generation, I've been drinking this combo for almost a decade. This study has no control for the initial propensity for risk that the individuals natrually possess. It certainly doesn't make me more inclined to take any risks. What it does do for me is allow me to keep up with my non-parent friends who can stay up dancing until 5am. Otherwise, I'd pass out at 11pm (toddlers really make you tired, no need to make a study for that). I don't over-do it. Those who do would overdo it and take risks no matter what they were drinking.<\/p><p>@johnna: that's absurd. If there is any truth to your post, then your brother most likely died because he had a congenital heart defect that may have been exacerbated by the caffeine and\/or sugar in the energy drink.<\/p><p>Glad to know that I only consumed a small qty of jagerbombs in my life \u2013 and never more than 1 in a single night. I no longer drink any sort of energy drink, they are just bad news all around.<\/p><p>So.... Vodka and Red Bull is bad, but an Irish Coffee is okay? Huh.<\/p><p>You need the alcohol mixers in order to drink the red bull \u2013 that stuff is just nasty \u2013 battery acid tasting. \"An acquired taste.\" Sorry, no thanks.<\/p><p>Moderation is key. Binge drinking is just plain stupid. When you have college students who think they will live forever, try to drink a keg themselves, or a liter of Jack Daniels at one sitting or ... your self-prescribed alcohol mix here ... then you will have problems.<\/p><p>Yes, first time binge drinkers can die. Yes, some alcoholic drinkers can drink all they way all the time and nothing \"serious\" happens to them, yet others imitating them can die. George Burns drank and smoke cigars til he died. Thousands of others imitating his kind of lifestyle died much sooner. We may never know what kept him from having problems.<\/p><p>I don't drink, but if I did, I'd have an XS Energy Drink and some good vodka. 14 flavors, little caffiene (6 oz coffee amt) but 5000% Vitamin B12. Yes, it could make a more awake drunk. But you could also drink the XS Energy without the booze and not have a sugar crash later. Because it doesn't have any sugar or carbs in it. Only 8 calories a can. And no acquired taste for battery acid required. www . jve . biz pwd: nutrition<\/p><p>Most of these posts scare me to death for today's generation. I hope there aren't many out there like you.<\/p><p>My preference is Tequila Bombs or Watermelon Crawls....a shot of tequila surrounded by the energy drink or 1\/2 shot tequila and 1\/2 shot watermelon pucker surrounded by energy drink. I usually drink about 12 of these on a \"party\" night. Feel real good all night and never feel sick the next day if I stop at 12. Anything after 12 can take a turn for the worse!<\/p><p>This is news? 30 years ago, it was caffiene tablets from the back of High Times and power drinking. 20 years ago, it was speed and power drinking. 10 years ago, energy drinks came on the scene and power drinkers have made the transition official. Now we have a study that advises if you give caffiene or other herbal stimulants to a power-drinker, then you get a wide-awake drunk. I wonder once again how much tax money was spent to tell me what I already knew. Does a Wide-Awake drunk engage in more risky behavior? DUH.... Is there a likelihood of Alcohol poisoning and even death in these situations? again, DUH.... The more things change, the more they remain the same.<\/p><p>What a ridiculous study. It's sad that people even consider this news. There is more caffeine in headache medicine than in a Red Bull. I agree that some of the larger energy drinks, like Monster and Rockstar have quite a bit of caffeine....but mixing it with alcohol isn't the problem. It's the alcohol! People have been mixing liquor with coca cola and coffee forever and this is no different.<\/p><p>Caffeine and alcohol? Who would have *ever* thought of mixing those two?<\/p><p>Anyone ever heard of \"Rum & Coke\" before?<\/p><p>And to the people who are equating mixing alcohol and energy drinks to cocaine, wow, you could not be more wrong. It is not even close to the same thing. Not even a little bit.<\/p><p>Hopefully they people get anxiety and depression and kill themselves before they cost all of money in the free health care they will require and get! Let's all be idiots and then make everyone else pay the price.<\/p><p>BRILLIANT!!!! Kids that are 25 and younger in this country are absolutely useless anyway. Hopefully they wipe themselves out and we jump right to next generation. Afterall, it is the same people that have worshiped Britany Spears, Paris Hilton, The Hills, and energy drinks.<\/p><p>I think we will be ok if they all end up in mental hospitals or dead.<\/p><p>Risky behavior? I would think that's the least of your concerns when your mixing uppers and downers. I feel like we might see the effects of those nasty drinks in studies done years from now on my peers that party hard. Eating a healthy diet, exercise and proper breathing also gives you energy...all day long!<\/p><p>Huh....I would think the mix would leave you with one heck of a hang over. The kind that feels like a spike in your brain.<\/p><p>@ Poppy: diaf pls. k, thnx<\/p><p>@ the rest of you: Chill out. You all are like watching people run around in circles pulling their hair out in a mad panic. omg omg this is hooooorible. We must lemming march and listen to these wise souls who tell us their correlational study is the gospel truth!<\/p><p>Alcohol has been a source of risky behavior since the dawn of, well, liquor. I don't think adding a Red Bull or a Monster is going to make that any less true.<\/p><p>I really get annoyed when people leave comments just to say, \"This isn't news!\" People need to be reminded once in a while if something isn't a good idea. A lot of people mix energy drinks with alcohol. As for myself, usually consume my energy drink an hour or so before beginning a night out to shake off a mood, a feeling of sloth. So maybe my timing is OK? I haven't noticed anything too unusual when I do this. It is wise to remember \"everything in moderation\", as someone above said. It is common sense, but how many of of really practice that?<\/p><p>\"Woolsey says the danger isn't specifically in the caffeine; it's in the combination of drinks with the other stimulants potentially being more dangerous because people haven't built up tolerances to them.

My bad; I forgot that society no longer has common sense.<\/p><p>6 years ago my brother was found dead in his apartment. The only explanation the coroner gave my family was that his heart \"just stopped\", and it was most likely due to the fact that he had been drinking what you call \"energy cocktails\" with friends the night before (red bull and vodka). Drinking these things doesnt just affect your decision making skills, or cause anxiety disorders, IT CAN KILL YOU.<\/p><p>PLEASE, everybody who reads this, remember uppers and downers DO NOT MIX<\/p><p>Why? This trend has happened in the past too with other stimulants. Stimulants with depressants have a synergistic effect in some cases trippling the effect of one or the other which can have deadly consequences. The people using these combinations, one need to grow up and stop mixing drinks like little kids at a coolaid party and two wake up before they cannot wake up...they mix drinks for attention and some mystical edge that those flakes think they get from mixing energy drinks and alcohol....sad.<\/p><p>Energy drinks are disgusting. Why would anyone mix them with alcohol?<\/p><p>When i was in college we would routinly drink all night long taking caffine pills through out to stay up. Its a lot of fun, I had such good times in college, I miss it. We would also inhale aerosol room deoderizers. That just made you kinda pass out and fall down, so not as much fun. I found that if I drank all night with the caffine pills I could smoke a one hitter just before going to sleep and I wouldnt have a hangover when I woke up. I could start the process over when I woke up. I did this 5-6 nights a week on average. I graduated with a 3.4 gpa and now I have a great job making 93k per year. So there really isnt any harm in this behavior.<\/p><p>Another misleading study. Forget that the people that drink energy drinks and alcohol together are just more riskier.

I also am not prone to risky behaviour other than the rare binge drinking.<\/p><p>Gee what do you know... more things that are bad for you!! What a bogus study. Too much of anything harmful to your body is going to do damage. I for one love the combo but only in moderation. Risky behavior... Give me a break!

The fact remains, risk increases, not decreases.<\/p><p>It's always interesting to hear from those who justify questionable activity, whether or not it has been definitively determined to be risky. It usually begins with the phrase '...I like..', as if the ends, the effect, justifies the means, the unknown mixture, regardless of the actual risks, usually unknown.<\/p><p>Well, some people like pit bulls, some like shooting AK's at wildlife, some like driving SUV's like sports cars, but, none of those are conducive to low risk, great decisions or desirable behavior.<\/p><p>The operative word here is MAY.

(Julie Percha\/The Washington Post)<\/p><p>Romney has huddled with prominent donors and reconnected with supporters in key states in recent months. Because of the vacuum of power within his party and the lack of a clear 2016 front-runner, confidants said Romney is grappling with this question: If drafted, would he answer the party's call?<\/p><p>Further juicing the speculation was a Des Moines Register-Bloomberg News poll released over the weekend showing that Romney is the only potential 2016 candidate who would beat Hillary Rodham Clinton (D) among likely Iowa voters, 44 percent to 43 percent.<\/p><p>People in Romney's vast political orbit who are waiting and wishing on him to launch another campaign said Romney has done little to quiet them and has been hazy about his plans following next month's midterm elections.<\/p><p>Former Minnesota governor Tim Pawlenty (R), who briefly ran against Romney in 2012 before becoming a close ally, said he wants to see Romney give it another go.<\/p><p>\"There is a feeling that the country missed out on an exceptional president,\" Pawlenty said. \"If he runs, I believe he could win the nomination and the general election. It'd be the right person at the right time, and I would encourage him to do it.\"<\/p><p>Pawlenty noted that Ronald Reagan ran unsuccessfully for president twice before being elected in his third attempt \"and was stronger for it.\" In contrast with Romney, Pawlenty said, \"the emerging class of Republican candidates is untested and unproven.\"<\/p><p>Within Romney's political network, there has been informal chatter about a third run since early 2013, according to people familiar with the discussions. It bubbled up in phone calls and at dinners and has gained steam this year. Requests continue to pour in for him to appear on the campaign trail, and advisers said he is eager to mount a multi-state fly-around swing before Nov. 4.<\/p><p>In Iowa, however, Romney seemed uncomfortable with the 2016 talk. At the West Des Moines rally, he spoke for only five minutes, criticizing President Obama on income inequality, foreign affairs and other issues. When reporters tried to question him afterward, he sneaked into a dark maze of cubicles.<\/p><p>He also said that now that he was no longer a candidate, he had a joke to share involving Obama, golfer Phil Mickelson and tennis great Andre Agassi.<\/p><p>As Romney told it, Obama shows up at a bank to cash a check without his ID. The teller asks him to prove who he is, saying that Mickelson proved his identity by hitting a golf ball into a cup and Agassi proved his by hitting a tennis ball at a target. \"Is there anything you can do to prove who you are?\" the teller asks.<\/p><p>\"I don't have a clue,\" Obama replies in the joke.<\/p><p>The crowd ate it up.<\/p><p>Former aides and senior Republicans say Romney appreciates the GOP masses crowing that he was right about issues such as Russia and health care. But what really intrigues him, they said, are the vulnerabilities among top-tier candidates in the Republican field. If Romney moves toward a race, it would be because he sees a path to victory.<\/p><p>\"It's the market pulling him,\" said Kent Lucken, a longtime friend and adviser who accompanied Romney to Iowa. \"People look at Hillary as the likely Democratic nominee, and the party needs a strong leader who can stand up to her and who's been through the process.\"<\/p><p>Romney is returning to Boston on Tuesday for a dinner that he and his wife, Ann, are hosting for former campaign advisers and business associates.

Romney visited Sept. 23 with Joe Ricketts, a billionaire investor who finances the Ending Spending super PAC, at Ricketts's palatial penthouse apartment covering the entire 78th floor of the Time Warner Center in New York.<\/p><p>On Oct. 6, Romney also took part in a GOP fundraising dinner at the Manhattan apartment of Woody Johnson, the New York Jets owner and former Romney campaign finance chairman. Several 2016 hopefuls gave presentations to the donors, while Romney served as a co-host and made no pitch.<\/p><p>At Johnson's home, Romney and media magnate Rupert Murdoch spoke about Romney's political future. According to two Romney allies familiar with the conversation, Romney was cagey with Murdoch but expressed concerns about the developing GOP field. Romney told Murdoch that he felt uneasy about the party's non-interventionist drift on foreign policy and the base's embrace of ideological hard-liners.<\/p><p>Many Romney boosters believe that his window of opportunity will be in mid- to late 2015, should Sens. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) or Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) ascend and party establishment types turn to Romney as a savior.<\/p><p>If former Florida governor Jeb Bush (R) opts out of a campaign, \"there is going to be more pressure on Mitt to go,\" said Tom Rath, an influential New Hampshire Republican.<\/p><p>At a luncheon this month in Atlanta to help GOP Senate nominee David Perdue, \"people sat up and paid attention\" to Romney, said Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.). \"I pulled him aside afterward to thank him for coming. He said he's not running, and I take him at his word. But I don't think the door is entirely closed, and circumstances can change.\"<\/p><p>That phrase \u2014 \"circumstances can change\" \u2014 has been repeated by many Romney backers since the former nominee used it to describe his own thinking about 2016 in a radio interview last month with Hugh Hewitt.<\/p><p>Spencer Zwick, Romney's former national finance chairman, talks regularly with Romney and said he has been receiving daily calls from donors and other supporters. \"There are still plenty of donors who hope circumstances will change and there will be an opportunity for Romney to run again,\" he said.<\/p><p>Zwick is part of a slimmed-down inner circle, including longtime advisers Beth Myers, Peter Flaherty, Stuart Stevens, Lanhee Chen and aides Kelli Harrison and Matt Waldrip, who are advising Romney on political activities this fall.<\/p><p>Romney traveled through Iowa with three trusted advisers and friends: David Kochel, Ron Kaufman and Lucken. He also reunited with supporters from campaigns past.

But I don't think the door is entirely closed, and circumstances can change.\"<\/p><p>That phrase \u2014 \"circumstances can change\" \u2014 has been repeated by many Romney backers since the former nominee used it to describe his own thinking about 2016 in a radio interview last month with Hugh Hewitt.<\/p><p>Spencer Zwick, Romney's former national finance chairman, talks regularly with Romney and said he has been receiving daily calls from donors and other supporters. \"There are still plenty of donors who hope circumstances will change and there will be an opportunity for Romney to run again,\" he said.<\/p><p>Zwick is part of a slimmed-down inner circle, including longtime advisers Beth Myers, Peter Flaherty, Stuart Stevens, Lanhee Chen and aides Kelli Harrison and Matt Waldrip, who are advising Romney on political activities this fall.<\/p><p>Romney traveled through Iowa with three trusted advisers and friends: David Kochel, Ron Kaufman and Lucken. He also reunited with supporters from campaigns past. In Cedar Rapids, Romney spotted Jim Wilson, a Virginia man who logged more than 40,000 miles chasing the GOP nominee from coast to coast in his campaign-festooned GMC pickup. The two hugged. \"You son of a gun,\" Romney said.<\/p><p>Another fan, Gary Chidester, 64, came to the West Des Moines rally with a full coterie of Romney paraphernalia for the former candidate to autograph: campaign placards, enlarged photographs and buttons of Mitt and wife Ann, and paperback and audio copies of Romney's book \"No Apology.\" He also held a framed drawing that a friend gave him of a black cruise ship named Obama sinking into the sea and a white ship named Romney with the caption, \"We're here to save you.\"<\/p><p>\"He's the only qualified person to run this time,\" Chidester said. \"Mitt is a business genius. That's why I've listened to this tape three times. He had it all down \u2014 he had Russia down, he had the debt down \u2014 and all the other Republicans are novices by comparison.\"","128":"We need a study to tell us things like this?

The fact remains, risk increases, not decreases.<\/p><p>It's always interesting to hear from those who justify questionable activity, whether or not it has been definitively determined to be risky. It usually begins with the phrase '...I like..', as if the ends, the effect, justifies the means, the unknown mixture, regardless of the actual risks, usually unknown.<\/p><p>Well, some people like pit bulls, some like shooting AK's at wildlife, some like driving SUV's like sports cars, but, none of those are conducive to low risk, great decisions or desirable behavior.<\/p><p>The operative word here is MAY. This is not a definitive study and, therefore, any conclusions are not empirical.<\/p><p>Two of the worst hangovers I have ever had were the result of just 2 or 3 vodka-redbulls... No thanks, no more, that cured me.<\/p><p>This indicates a link to Anxiety and Manic Depressive behavior.<\/p><p>I used to drink energy drinks to help recover from the previous night.

[not] conducive to low risk, great decisions or desirable behavior\" I have a pitbull. They are VERY loving and loyal dogs. Even a poodle who is raised wrong can cause great injury to a person. I think it's irresponsible to use owning a pitbull to try and make a point about reckless behavior. You are just spreading the hate. ANY dog raised in a sick environment can turn out dangerous.<\/p><p>Sometimes I will have an energy beer, or do some various 'bomb' containing redbull and something 80-proof.

I wish doctors and researchers would find a cure for cancer and AIDS and stop 'researching' all of these common sense things!

Here's a look at some of Romney's worst gaffes and a few predictions he got right. (Julie Percha\/The Washington Post)<\/p><p>Romney has huddled with prominent donors and reconnected with supporters in key states in recent months. Because of the vacuum of power within his party and the lack of a clear 2016 front-runner, confidants said Romney is grappling with this question: If drafted, would he answer the party's call?<\/p><p>Further juicing the speculation was a Des Moines Register-Bloomberg News poll released over the weekend showing that Romney is the only potential 2016 candidate who would beat Hillary Rodham Clinton (D) among likely Iowa voters, 44 percent to 43 percent.<\/p><p>People in Romney's vast political orbit who are waiting and wishing on him to launch another campaign said Romney has done little to quiet them and has been hazy about his plans following next month's midterm elections.<\/p><p>Former Minnesota governor Tim Pawlenty (R), who briefly ran against Romney in 2012 before becoming a close ally, said he wants to see Romney give it another go.<\/p><p>\"There is a feeling that the country missed out on an exceptional president,\" Pawlenty said. \"If he runs, I believe he could win the nomination and the general election. It'd be the right person at the right time, and I would encourage him to do it.\"<\/p><p>Pawlenty noted that Ronald Reagan ran unsuccessfully for president twice before being elected in his third attempt \"and was stronger for it.\" In contrast with Romney, Pawlenty said, \"the emerging class of Republican candidates is untested and unproven.\"<\/p><p>Within Romney's political network, there has been informal chatter about a third run since early 2013, according to people familiar with the discussions. It bubbled up in phone calls and at dinners and has gained steam this year. Requests continue to pour in for him to appear on the campaign trail, and advisers said he is eager to mount a multi-state fly-around swing before Nov. 4.<\/p><p>In Iowa, however, Romney seemed uncomfortable with the 2016 talk. At the West Des Moines rally, he spoke for only five minutes, criticizing President Obama on income inequality, foreign affairs and other issues. When reporters tried to question him afterward, he sneaked into a dark maze of cubicles.<\/p><p>He also said that now that he was no longer a candidate, he had a joke to share involving Obama, golfer Phil Mickelson and tennis great Andre Agassi.<\/p><p>As Romney told it, Obama shows up at a bank to cash a check without his ID. The teller asks him to prove who he is, saying that Mickelson proved his identity by hitting a golf ball into a cup and Agassi proved his by hitting a tennis ball at a target. \"Is there anything you can do to prove who you are?\" the teller asks.<\/p><p>\"I don't have a clue,\" Obama replies in the joke.<\/p><p>The crowd ate it up.<\/p><p>Former aides and senior Republicans say Romney appreciates the GOP masses crowing that he was right about issues such as Russia and health care. But what really intrigues him, they said, are the vulnerabilities among top-tier candidates in the Republican field. If Romney moves toward a race, it would be because he sees a path to victory.<\/p><p>\"It's the market pulling him,\" said Kent Lucken, a longtime friend and adviser who accompanied Romney to Iowa. \"People look at Hillary as the likely Democratic nominee, and the party needs a strong leader who can stand up to her and who's been through the process.\"<\/p><p>Romney is returning to Boston on Tuesday for a dinner that he and his wife, Ann, are hosting for former campaign advisers and business associates. The event \u2014 to benefit neurological research at Brigham and Women's Hospital \u2014 has Romney intimates abuzz.<\/p><p>Save-the-date notices have gone out for the third annual Romney policy retreat in Park City, Utah, in June 2015 \u2014 a signal that he wants a platform to promote his issues as the presidential primary campaign season gets underway.<\/p><p>Romney is also mingling privately with top donors who could fund a third campaign. Romney visited Sept. 23 with Joe Ricketts, a billionaire investor who finances the Ending Spending super PAC, at Ricketts's palatial penthouse apartment covering the entire 78th floor of the Time Warner Center in New York.<\/p><p>On Oct. 6, Romney also took part in a GOP fundraising dinner at the Manhattan apartment of Woody Johnson, the New York Jets owner and former Romney campaign finance chairman. Several 2016 hopefuls gave presentations to the donors, while Romney served as a co-host and made no pitch.<\/p><p>At Johnson's home, Romney and media magnate Rupert Murdoch spoke about Romney's political future. According to two Romney allies familiar with the conversation, Romney was cagey with Murdoch but expressed concerns about the developing GOP field. Romney told Murdoch that he felt uneasy about the party's non-interventionist drift on foreign policy and the base's embrace of ideological hard-liners.<\/p><p>Many Romney boosters believe that his window of opportunity will be in mid- to late 2015, should Sens. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) or Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) ascend and party establishment types turn to Romney as a savior.<\/p><p>If former Florida governor Jeb Bush (R) opts out of a campaign, \"there is going to be more pressure on Mitt to go,\" said Tom Rath, an influential New Hampshire Republican.<\/p><p>At a luncheon this month in Atlanta to help GOP Senate nominee David Perdue, \"people sat up and paid attention\" to Romney, said Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.). \"I pulled him aside afterward to thank him for coming. He said he's not running, and I take him at his word. But I don't think the door is entirely closed, and circumstances can change.\"<\/p><p>That phrase \u2014 \"circumstances can change\" \u2014 has been repeated by many Romney backers since the former nominee used it to describe his own thinking about 2016 in a radio interview last month with Hugh Hewitt.<\/p><p>Spencer Zwick, Romney's former national finance chairman, talks regularly with Romney and said he has been receiving daily calls from donors and other supporters. \"There are still plenty of donors who hope circumstances will change and there will be an opportunity for Romney to run again,\" he said.<\/p><p>Zwick is part of a slimmed-down inner circle, including longtime advisers Beth Myers, Peter Flaherty, Stuart Stevens, Lanhee Chen and aides Kelli Harrison and Matt Waldrip, who are advising Romney on political activities this fall.<\/p><p>Romney traveled through Iowa with three trusted advisers and friends: David Kochel, Ron Kaufman and Lucken. He also reunited with supporters from campaigns past. In Cedar Rapids, Romney spotted Jim Wilson, a Virginia man who logged more than 40,000 miles chasing the GOP nominee from coast to coast in his campaign-festooned GMC pickup. The two hugged. \"You son of a gun,\" Romney said.<\/p><p>Another fan, Gary Chidester, 64, came to the West Des Moines rally with a full coterie of Romney paraphernalia for the former candidate to autograph: campaign placards, enlarged photographs and buttons of Mitt and wife Ann, and paperback and audio copies of Romney's book \"No Apology.\" He also held a framed drawing that a friend gave him of a black cruise ship named Obama sinking into the sea and a white ship named Romney with the caption, \"We're here to save you.\"<\/p><p>\"He's the only qualified person to run this time,\" Chidester said. \"Mitt is a business genius. That's why I've listened to this tape three times. He had it all down \u2014 he had Russia down, he had the debt down \u2014 and all the other Republicans are novices by comparison.\"","136":"We need a study to tell us things like this? My bad; I forgot that society no longer has common sense.<\/p><p>6 years ago my brother was found dead in his apartment. The only explanation the coroner gave my family was that his heart \"just stopped\", and it was most likely due to the fact that he had been drinking what you call \"energy cocktails\" with friends the night before (red bull and vodka). Drinking these things doesnt just affect your decision making skills, or cause anxiety disorders, IT CAN KILL YOU.<\/p><p>PLEASE, everybody who reads this, remember uppers and downers DO NOT MIX<\/p><p>Why? This trend has happened in the past too with other stimulants. Stimulants with depressants have a synergistic effect in some cases trippling the effect of one or the other which can have deadly consequences. The people using these combinations, one need to grow up and stop mixing drinks like little kids at a coolaid party and two wake up before they cannot wake up...they mix drinks for attention and some mystical edge that those flakes think they get from mixing energy drinks and alcohol....sad.<\/p><p>Energy drinks are disgusting. Why would anyone mix them with alcohol?<\/p><p>When i was in college we would routinly drink all night long taking caffine pills through out to stay up. Its a lot of fun, I had such good times in college, I miss it. We would also inhale aerosol room deoderizers. That just made you kinda pass out and fall down, so not as much fun. I found that if I drank all night with the caffine pills I could smoke a one hitter just before going to sleep and I wouldnt have a hangover when I woke up. I could start the process over when I woke up. I did this 5-6 nights a week on average. I graduated with a 3.4 gpa and now I have a great job making 93k per year. So there really isnt any harm in this behavior.<\/p><p>Another misleading study. Forget that the people that drink energy drinks and alcohol together are just more riskier. Its the caffeine and alcohol combination that makes them morons. God forbid they are morons without the combination of the two.<\/p><p>alcohol + energy drinks = a great time!<\/p><p>Alcohol must be necessary to cut the awful taste of the energy drinks.<\/p><p>One major flaw in this study. Are the people who partake in this risky behaviour, including mixing caffiene and alcohol, more prone to this type of behaviour to begin with?<\/p><p>As a former \"cherry bomb\", vodka-red bull, and jager-bomb drinker, I can appreciate the feeling you get when you drink caffiene and liquor. I never did anything extra risky when clubing and drinking these beverages. I also am not prone to risky behaviour other than the rare binge drinking.<\/p><p>Gee what do you know... more things that are bad for you!! What a bogus study. Too much of anything harmful to your body is going to do damage. I for one love the combo but only in moderation. Risky behavior... Give me a break! Driving your car or even going to a party or club is \"risky\" behavior. With all the sickos in the world today, no one is ever safe. Always be aware of your surroundings and always in moderation.<\/p><p>This article reminded me that I had a 5 hr energy drink in my computer bag. Thanks! that just saved my afternoon.<\/p><p>Also, I drank 2 \u2013 5hr energies at a party last weekend and had a blast. Caffeine is what makes the world go round and alcohol makes the world a cooler place. So if my logic is correct the two combined are a match made in heaven. Drink on!<\/p><p>Red bull and vodka is the modern, legal, \"speedball,\" and we all know that caffeine + liquor simply equals a wide-awake drunk.<\/p><p>So how is this riskier than just getting drunk and then trying to sober up by drinking black coffee?<\/p><p>I agree with everyone who says that vodka plus Red Bull is just legal crack.<\/p><p>We might as well give up on the War on Drugs right now.<\/p><p>It's pointless to spend billions of dollars on fighting the cocaine cartels when you can just add vodka to Red Bull and get the same effect and the same damage to society from the perpetual overdoers.<\/p><p>Nothing new \u2013 someone once thought it was 'fun' to mix barbituates with stimulants. The fact remains, risk increases, not decreases.<\/p><p>It's always interesting to hear from those who justify questionable activity, whether or not it has been definitively determined to be risky. It usually begins with the phrase '...I like..', as if the ends, the effect, justifies the means, the unknown mixture, regardless of the actual risks, usually unknown.<\/p><p>Well, some people like pit bulls, some like shooting AK's at wildlife, some like driving SUV's like sports cars, but, none of those are conducive to low risk, great decisions or desirable behavior.<\/p><p>The operative word here is MAY. This is not a definitive study and, therefore, any conclusions are not empirical.<\/p><p>Two of the worst hangovers I have ever had were the result of just 2 or 3 vodka-redbulls... No thanks, no more, that cured me.<\/p><p>This indicates a link to Anxiety and Manic Depressive behavior.<\/p><p>I used to drink energy drinks to help recover from the previous night. I then discovered that the energy drinks + alcohol were less expensive than plain energy drinks (go figure). These became my first drinks of the day...I am now in 12 step recovery.<\/p><p>Who wants to live low risk their whole life? The entire USA is a country of risk\/pain\/consequence averse cowards. Im surprised the Amish dont take over the country.

Um, not even close people. How many of you out there take your doctor-prescribed anti-anxiety pills with your morning coffee? Same thing.<\/p><p>And to the person who said \"pit bulls... [not] conducive to low risk, great decisions or desirable behavior\" I have a pitbull. They are VERY loving and loyal dogs. Even a poodle who is raised wrong can cause great injury to a person. I think it's irresponsible to use owning a pitbull to try and make a point about reckless behavior. You are just spreading the hate. ANY dog raised in a sick environment can turn out dangerous.<\/p><p>Sometimes I will have an energy beer, or do some various 'bomb' containing redbull and something 80-proof. Obviously when you're hyper and drunk, you might do stupid things. When you're drunk and tired, you might also do stupid things. I wish doctors and researchers would find a cure for cancer and AIDS and stop 'researching' all of these common sense things! Ridiculous.<\/p><p>I like to start the night off with a energydrink and vodka mix. one or two to get me going and then I switch to beer. I have been doing this for years and have not noticed any problems with health or risk taking.<\/p><p>Taste Great, but yeah uppers + downers is a bad idea<\/p><p>To Poppy, I think I went to college with you and was perhaps involved in the debauchery...but don't make nearly what you make, and not everyone is as lucky as you, or dodges as many life bullets as you have. word.<\/p><p>I am sorry to read the post about the brother who passed away, possibly related to the mixture of energy drinks and alcohol.

This study has no control for the initial propensity for risk that the individuals natrually possess. It certainly doesn't make me more inclined to take any risks. What it does do for me is allow me to keep up with my non-parent friends who can stay up dancing until 5am.

My bad; I forgot that society no longer has common sense.<\/p><p>6 years ago my brother was found dead in his apartment. The only explanation the coroner gave my family was that his heart \"just stopped\", and it was most likely due to the fact that he had been drinking what you call \"energy cocktails\" with friends the night before (red bull and vodka). Drinking these things doesnt just affect your decision making skills, or cause anxiety disorders, IT CAN KILL YOU.<\/p><p>PLEASE, everybody who reads this, remember uppers and downers DO NOT MIX<\/p><p>Why? This trend has happened in the past too with other stimulants. Stimulants with depressants have a synergistic effect in some cases trippling the effect of one or the other which can have deadly consequences. The people using these combinations, one need to grow up and stop mixing drinks like little kids at a coolaid party and two wake up before they cannot wake up...they mix drinks for attention and some mystical edge that those flakes think they get from mixing energy drinks and alcohol....sad.<\/p><p>Energy drinks are disgusting. Why would anyone mix them with alcohol?<\/p><p>When i was in college we would routinly drink all night long taking caffine pills through out to stay up. Its a lot of fun, I had such good times in college, I miss it. We would also inhale aerosol room deoderizers. That just made you kinda pass out and fall down, so not as much fun. I found that if I drank all night with the caffine pills I could smoke a one hitter just before going to sleep and I wouldnt have a hangover when I woke up. I could start the process over when I woke up. I did this 5-6 nights a week on average. I graduated with a 3.4 gpa and now I have a great job making 93k per year. So there really isnt any harm in this behavior.<\/p><p>Another misleading study. Forget that the people that drink energy drinks and alcohol together are just more riskier. Its the caffeine and alcohol combination that makes them morons. God forbid they are morons without the combination of the two.<\/p><p>alcohol + energy drinks = a great time!<\/p><p>Alcohol must be necessary to cut the awful taste of the energy drinks.<\/p><p>One major flaw in this study. Are the people who partake in this risky behaviour, including mixing caffiene and alcohol, more prone to this type of behaviour to begin with?<\/p><p>As a former \"cherry bomb\", vodka-red bull, and jager-bomb drinker, I can appreciate the feeling you get when you drink caffiene and liquor. I never did anything extra risky when clubing and drinking these beverages. I also am not prone to risky behaviour other than the rare binge drinking.<\/p><p>Gee what do you know... more things that are bad for you!! What a bogus study. Too much of anything harmful to your body is going to do damage. I for one love the combo but only in moderation. Risky behavior... Give me a break! Driving your car or even going to a party or club is \"risky\" behavior. With all the sickos in the world today, no one is ever safe.

The fact remains, risk increases, not decreases.<\/p><p>It's always interesting to hear from those who justify questionable activity, whether or not it has been definitively determined to be risky. It usually begins with the phrase '...I like..', as if the ends, the effect, justifies the means, the unknown mixture, regardless of the actual risks, usually unknown.<\/p><p>Well, some people like pit bulls, some like shooting AK's at wildlife, some like driving SUV's like sports cars, but, none of those are conducive to low risk, great decisions or desirable behavior.<\/p><p>The operative word here is MAY.

[not] conducive to low risk, great decisions or desirable behavior\" I have a pitbull. They are VERY loving and loyal dogs. Even a poodle who is raised wrong can cause great injury to a person. I think it's irresponsible to use owning a pitbull to try and make a point about reckless behavior. You are just spreading the hate. ANY dog raised in a sick environment can turn out dangerous.<\/p><p>Sometimes I will have an energy beer, or do some various 'bomb' containing redbull and something 80-proof. Obviously when you're hyper and drunk, you might do stupid things. When you're drunk and tired, you might also do stupid things. I wish doctors and researchers would find a cure for cancer and AIDS and stop 'researching' all of these common sense things!

This study has no control for the initial propensity for risk that the individuals natrually possess. It certainly doesn't make me more inclined to take any risks. What it does do for me is allow me to keep up with my non-parent friends who can stay up dancing until 5am. Otherwise, I'd pass out at 11pm (toddlers really make you tired, no need to make a study for that). I don't over-do it. Those who do would overdo it and take risks no matter what they were drinking.<\/p><p>@johnna: that's absurd.

Anything after 12 can take a turn for the worse!<\/p><p>This is news? 30 years ago, it was caffiene tablets from the back of High Times and power drinking. 20 years ago, it was speed and power drinking. 10 years ago, energy drinks came on the scene and power drinkers have made the transition official. Now we have a study that advises if you give caffiene or other herbal stimulants to a power-drinker, then you get a wide-awake drunk. I wonder once again how much tax money was spent to tell me what I already knew. Does a Wide-Awake drunk engage in more risky behavior? DUH.... Is there a likelihood of Alcohol poisoning and even death in these situations? again, DUH.... The more things change, the more they remain the same.<\/p><p>What a ridiculous study. It's sad that people even consider this news. There is more caffeine in headache medicine than in a Red Bull. I agree that some of the larger energy drinks, like Monster and Rockstar have quite a bit of caffeine....but mixing it with alcohol isn't the problem. It's the alcohol!

Here's a look at some of Romney's worst gaffes and a few predictions he got right. (Julie Percha\/The Washington Post)<\/p><p>Romney has huddled with prominent donors and reconnected with supporters in key states in recent months. Because of the vacuum of power within his party and the lack of a clear 2016 front-runner, confidants said Romney is grappling with this question: If drafted, would he answer the party's call?<\/p><p>Further juicing the speculation was a Des Moines Register-Bloomberg News poll released over the weekend showing that Romney is the only potential 2016 candidate who would beat Hillary Rodham Clinton (D) among likely Iowa voters, 44 percent to 43 percent.<\/p><p>People in Romney's vast political orbit who are waiting and wishing on him to launch another campaign said Romney has done little to quiet them and has been hazy about his plans following next month's midterm elections.<\/p><p>Former Minnesota governor Tim Pawlenty (R), who briefly ran against Romney in 2012 before becoming a close ally, said he wants to see Romney give it another go.<\/p><p>\"There is a feeling that the country missed out on an exceptional president,\" Pawlenty said. \"If he runs, I believe he could win the nomination and the general election. It'd be the right person at the right time, and I would encourage him to do it.\"<\/p><p>Pawlenty noted that Ronald Reagan ran unsuccessfully for president twice before being elected in his third attempt \"and was stronger for it.\" In contrast with Romney, Pawlenty said, \"the emerging class of Republican candidates is untested and unproven.\"<\/p><p>Within Romney's political network, there has been informal chatter about a third run since early 2013, according to people familiar with the discussions. It bubbled up in phone calls and at dinners and has gained steam this year. Requests continue to pour in for him to appear on the campaign trail, and advisers said he is eager to mount a multi-state fly-around swing before Nov. 4.<\/p><p>In Iowa, however, Romney seemed uncomfortable with the 2016 talk. At the West Des Moines rally, he spoke for only five minutes, criticizing President Obama on income inequality, foreign affairs and other issues. When reporters tried to question him afterward, he sneaked into a dark maze of cubicles.<\/p><p>He also said that now that he was no longer a candidate, he had a joke to share involving Obama, golfer Phil Mickelson and tennis great Andre Agassi.<\/p><p>As Romney told it, Obama shows up at a bank to cash a check without his ID. The teller asks him to prove who he is, saying that Mickelson proved his identity by hitting a golf ball into a cup and Agassi proved his by hitting a tennis ball at a target. \"Is there anything you can do to prove who you are?\" the teller asks.<\/p><p>\"I don't have a clue,\" Obama replies in the joke.<\/p><p>The crowd ate it up.<\/p><p>Former aides and senior Republicans say Romney appreciates the GOP masses crowing that he was right about issues such as Russia and health care. But what really intrigues him, they said, are the vulnerabilities among top-tier candidates in the Republican field. If Romney moves toward a race, it would be because he sees a path to victory.<\/p><p>\"It's the market pulling him,\" said Kent Lucken, a longtime friend and adviser who accompanied Romney to Iowa. \"People look at Hillary as the likely Democratic nominee, and the party needs a strong leader who can stand up to her and who's been through the process.\"<\/p><p>Romney is returning to Boston on Tuesday for a dinner that he and his wife, Ann, are hosting for former campaign advisers and business associates.

Romney visited Sept. 23 with Joe Ricketts, a billionaire investor who finances the Ending Spending super PAC, at Ricketts's palatial penthouse apartment covering the entire 78th floor of the Time Warner Center in New York.<\/p><p>On Oct. 6, Romney also took part in a GOP fundraising dinner at the Manhattan apartment of Woody Johnson, the New York Jets owner and former Romney campaign finance chairman. Several 2016 hopefuls gave presentations to the donors, while Romney served as a co-host and made no pitch.<\/p><p>At Johnson's home, Romney and media magnate Rupert Murdoch spoke about Romney's political future. According to two Romney allies familiar with the conversation, Romney was cagey with Murdoch but expressed concerns about the developing GOP field. Romney told Murdoch that he felt uneasy about the party's non-interventionist drift on foreign policy and the base's embrace of ideological hard-liners.<\/p><p>Many Romney boosters believe that his window of opportunity will be in mid- to late 2015, should Sens. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) or Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) ascend and party establishment types turn to Romney as a savior.<\/p><p>If former Florida governor Jeb Bush (R) opts out of a campaign, \"there is going to be more pressure on Mitt to go,\" said Tom Rath, an influential New Hampshire Republican.<\/p><p>At a luncheon this month in Atlanta to help GOP Senate nominee David Perdue, \"people sat up and paid attention\" to Romney, said Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.). \"I pulled him aside afterward to thank him for coming. He said he's not running, and I take him at his word. But I don't think the door is entirely closed, and circumstances can change.\"<\/p><p>That phrase \u2014 \"circumstances can change\" \u2014 has been repeated by many Romney backers since the former nominee used it to describe his own thinking about 2016 in a radio interview last month with Hugh Hewitt.<\/p><p>Spencer Zwick, Romney's former national finance chairman, talks regularly with Romney and said he has been receiving daily calls from donors and other supporters. \"There are still plenty of donors who hope circumstances will change and there will be an opportunity for Romney to run again,\" he said.<\/p><p>Zwick is part of a slimmed-down inner circle, including longtime advisers Beth Myers, Peter Flaherty, Stuart Stevens, Lanhee Chen and aides Kelli Harrison and Matt Waldrip, who are advising Romney on political activities this fall.<\/p><p>Romney traveled through Iowa with three trusted advisers and friends: David Kochel, Ron Kaufman and Lucken. He also reunited with supporters from campaigns past. In Cedar Rapids, Romney spotted Jim Wilson, a Virginia man who logged more than 40,000 miles chasing the GOP nominee from coast to coast in his campaign-festooned GMC pickup. The two hugged. \"You son of a gun,\" Romney said.<\/p><p>Another fan, Gary Chidester, 64, came to the West Des Moines rally with a full coterie of Romney paraphernalia for the former candidate to autograph: campaign placards, enlarged photographs and buttons of Mitt and wife Ann, and paperback and audio copies of Romney's book \"No Apology.\" He also held a framed drawing that a friend gave him of a black cruise ship named Obama sinking into the sea and a white ship named Romney with the caption, \"We're here to save you.\"<\/p><p>\"He's the only qualified person to run this time,\" Chidester said. \"Mitt is a business genius.

My bad; I forgot that society no longer has common sense.<\/p><p>6 years ago my brother was found dead in his apartment. The only explanation the coroner gave my family was that his heart \"just stopped\", and it was most likely due to the fact that he had been drinking what you call \"energy cocktails\" with friends the night before (red bull and vodka). Drinking these things doesnt just affect your decision making skills, or cause anxiety disorders, IT CAN KILL YOU.<\/p><p>PLEASE, everybody who reads this, remember uppers and downers DO NOT MIX<\/p><p>Why?

Why would anyone mix them with alcohol?<\/p><p>When i was in college we would routinly drink all night long taking caffine pills through out to stay up. Its a lot of fun, I had such good times in college, I miss it. We would also inhale aerosol room deoderizers. That just made you kinda pass out and fall down, so not as much fun. I found that if I drank all night with the caffine pills I could smoke a one hitter just before going to sleep and I wouldnt have a hangover when I woke up. I could start the process over when I woke up. I did this 5-6 nights a week on average. I graduated with a 3.4 gpa and now I have a great job making 93k per year.

Too much of anything harmful to your body is going to do damage. I for one love the combo but only in moderation. Risky behavior... Give me a break! Driving your car or even going to a party or club is \"risky\" behavior. With all the sickos in the world today, no one is ever safe. Always be aware of your surroundings and always in moderation.<\/p><p>This article reminded me that I had a 5 hr energy drink in my computer bag. Thanks! that just saved my afternoon.<\/p><p>Also, I drank 2 \u2013 5hr energies at a party last weekend and had a blast. Caffeine is what makes the world go round and alcohol makes the world a cooler place. So if my logic is correct the two combined are a match made in heaven. Drink on!<\/p><p>Red bull and vodka is the modern, legal, \"speedball,\" and we all know that caffeine + liquor simply equals a wide-awake drunk.<\/p><p>So how is this riskier than just getting drunk and then trying to sober up by drinking black coffee?<\/p><p>I agree with everyone who says that vodka plus Red Bull is just legal crack.<\/p><p>We might as well give up on the War on Drugs right now.<\/p><p>It's pointless to spend billions of dollars on fighting the cocaine cartels when you can just add vodka to Red Bull and get the same effect and the same damage to society from the perpetual overdoers.<\/p><p>Nothing new \u2013 someone once thought it was 'fun' to mix barbituates with stimulants. The fact remains, risk increases, not decreases.<\/p><p>It's always interesting to hear from those who justify questionable activity, whether or not it has been definitively determined to be risky. It usually begins with the phrase '...I like..', as if the ends, the effect, justifies the means, the unknown mixture, regardless of the actual risks, usually unknown.<\/p><p>Well, some people like pit bulls, some like shooting AK's at wildlife, some like driving SUV's like sports cars, but, none of those are conducive to low risk, great decisions or desirable behavior.<\/p><p>The operative word here is MAY. This is not a definitive study and, therefore, any conclusions are not empirical.<\/p><p>Two of the worst hangovers I have ever had were the result of just 2 or 3 vodka-redbulls... No thanks, no more, that cured me.<\/p><p>This indicates a link to Anxiety and Manic Depressive behavior.<\/p><p>I used to drink energy drinks to help recover from the previous night. I then discovered that the energy drinks + alcohol were less expensive than plain energy drinks (go figure).

[not] conducive to low risk, great decisions or desirable behavior\" I have a pitbull. They are VERY loving and loyal dogs. Even a poodle who is raised wrong can cause great injury to a person. I think it's irresponsible to use owning a pitbull to try and make a point about reckless behavior. You are just spreading the hate. ANY dog raised in a sick environment can turn out dangerous.<\/p><p>Sometimes I will have an energy beer, or do some various 'bomb' containing redbull and something 80-proof.

I wish doctors and researchers would find a cure for cancer and AIDS and stop 'researching' all of these common sense things!

But at a closed-door breakfast fundraiser here Monday, the first question from a donor had nothing to do with Ernst's Senate campaign.<\/p><p>\"When you get elected to the Senate, your job should be to convince Mitt Romney to run for president again,\" a donor told Ernst, according to several attendees. The Republican candidate said she would, while Romney laughed.<\/p><p>When Romney and Ernst gathered in a West Des Moines boardroom with about 40 agriculture executives Sunday night, one businessman after another pleaded with Romney to give the White House another shot.<\/p><p>And at a rally for Ernst in Cedar Rapids on Monday, the state legislator who introduced Romney said, \"If his address was 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, I would sleep a lot better.\" After Romney and Ernst finished speaking, some activists chanted, \"Run, Mitt, run!\"<\/p><p>Romney, the 2012 GOP presidential nominee and now the tacit head of the Republican Party, visited Iowa as part of a feverish nationwide tour designed to help the GOP take control of the Senate.

Here's a look at some of Romney's worst gaffes and a few predictions he got right. (Julie Percha\/The Washington Post)<\/p><p>Romney has huddled with prominent donors and reconnected with supporters in key states in recent months. Because of the vacuum of power within his party and the lack of a clear 2016 front-runner, confidants said Romney is grappling with this question: If drafted, would he answer the party's call?<\/p><p>Further juicing the speculation was a Des Moines Register-Bloomberg News poll released over the weekend showing that Romney is the only potential 2016 candidate who would beat Hillary Rodham Clinton (D) among likely Iowa voters, 44 percent to 43 percent.<\/p><p>People in Romney's vast political orbit who are waiting and wishing on him to launch another campaign said Romney has done little to quiet them and has been hazy about his plans following next month's midterm elections.<\/p><p>Former Minnesota governor Tim Pawlenty (R), who briefly ran against Romney in 2012 before becoming a close ally, said he wants to see Romney give it another go.<\/p><p>\"There is a feeling that the country missed out on an exceptional president,\" Pawlenty said. \"If he runs, I believe he could win the nomination and the general election. It'd be the right person at the right time, and I would encourage him to do it.\"<\/p><p>Pawlenty noted that Ronald Reagan ran unsuccessfully for president twice before being elected in his third attempt \"and was stronger for it.\" In contrast with Romney, Pawlenty said, \"the emerging class of Republican candidates is untested and unproven.\"<\/p><p>Within Romney's political network, there has been informal chatter about a third run since early 2013, according to people familiar with the discussions. It bubbled up in phone calls and at dinners and has gained steam this year. Requests continue to pour in for him to appear on the campaign trail, and advisers said he is eager to mount a multi-state fly-around swing before Nov. 4.<\/p><p>In Iowa, however, Romney seemed uncomfortable with the 2016 talk. At the West Des Moines rally, he spoke for only five minutes, criticizing President Obama on income inequality, foreign affairs and other issues. When reporters tried to question him afterward, he sneaked into a dark maze of cubicles.<\/p><p>He also said that now that he was no longer a candidate, he had a joke to share involving Obama, golfer Phil Mickelson and tennis great Andre Agassi.<\/p><p>As Romney told it, Obama shows up at a bank to cash a check without his ID. The teller asks him to prove who he is, saying that Mickelson proved his identity by hitting a golf ball into a cup and Agassi proved his by hitting a tennis ball at a target. \"Is there anything you can do to prove who you are?\" the teller asks.<\/p><p>\"I don't have a clue,\" Obama replies in the joke.<\/p><p>The crowd ate it up.<\/p><p>Former aides and senior Republicans say Romney appreciates the GOP masses crowing that he was right about issues such as Russia and health care. But what really intrigues him, they said, are the vulnerabilities among top-tier candidates in the Republican field. If Romney moves toward a race, it would be because he sees a path to victory.<\/p><p>\"It's the market pulling him,\" said Kent Lucken, a longtime friend and adviser who accompanied Romney to Iowa. \"People look at Hillary as the likely Democratic nominee, and the party needs a strong leader who can stand up to her and who's been through the process.\"<\/p><p>Romney is returning to Boston on Tuesday for a dinner that he and his wife, Ann, are hosting for former campaign advisers and business associates.

Romney visited Sept. 23 with Joe Ricketts, a billionaire investor who finances the Ending Spending super PAC, at Ricketts's palatial penthouse apartment covering the entire 78th floor of the Time Warner Center in New York.<\/p><p>On Oct. 6, Romney also took part in a GOP fundraising dinner at the Manhattan apartment of Woody Johnson, the New York Jets owner and former Romney campaign finance chairman.

My bad; I forgot that society no longer has common sense.<\/p><p>6 years ago my brother was found dead in his apartment. The only explanation the coroner gave my family was that his heart \"just stopped\", and it was most likely due to the fact that he had been drinking what you call \"energy cocktails\" with friends the night before (red bull and vodka). Drinking these things doesnt just affect your decision making skills, or cause anxiety disorders, IT CAN KILL YOU.<\/p><p>PLEASE, everybody who reads this, remember uppers and downers DO NOT MIX<\/p><p>Why? This trend has happened in the past too with other stimulants. Stimulants with depressants have a synergistic effect in some cases trippling the effect of one or the other which can have deadly consequences. The people using these combinations, one need to grow up and stop mixing drinks like little kids at a coolaid party and two wake up before they cannot wake up...they mix drinks for attention and some mystical edge that those flakes think they get from mixing energy drinks and alcohol....sad.<\/p><p>Energy drinks are disgusting. Why would anyone mix them with alcohol?<\/p><p>When i was in college we would routinly drink all night long taking caffine pills through out to stay up. Its a lot of fun, I had such good times in college, I miss it. We would also inhale aerosol room deoderizers. That just made you kinda pass out and fall down, so not as much fun. I found that if I drank all night with the caffine pills I could smoke a one hitter just before going to sleep and I wouldnt have a hangover when I woke up. I could start the process over when I woke up. I did this 5-6 nights a week on average. I graduated with a 3.4 gpa and now I have a great job making 93k per year.

He has insisted that he is not interested in running for president a third time. But his friends said a flurry of behind-the-scenes activity is nudging him to more seriously consider it.<\/p><p>Former presidential candidate Mitt Romney is hitting the stump for Republicans this fall -- which reminded us of some of his most memorable moments during the 2012 campaign. Here's a look at some of Romney's worst gaffes and a few predictions he got right. (Julie Percha\/The Washington Post)<\/p><p>Romney has huddled with prominent donors and reconnected with supporters in key states in recent months. Because of the vacuum of power within his party and the lack of a clear 2016 front-runner, confidants said Romney is grappling with this question: If drafted, would he answer the party's call?<\/p><p>Further juicing the speculation was a Des Moines Register-Bloomberg News poll released over the weekend showing that Romney is the only potential 2016 candidate who would beat Hillary Rodham Clinton (D) among likely Iowa voters, 44 percent to 43 percent.<\/p><p>People in Romney's vast political orbit who are waiting and wishing on him to launch another campaign said Romney has done little to quiet them and has been hazy about his plans following next month's midterm elections.<\/p><p>Former Minnesota governor Tim Pawlenty (R), who briefly ran against Romney in 2012 before becoming a close ally, said he wants to see Romney give it another go.<\/p><p>\"There is a feeling that the country missed out on an exceptional president,\" Pawlenty said. \"If he runs, I believe he could win the nomination and the general election. It'd be the right person at the right time, and I would encourage him to do it.\"<\/p><p>Pawlenty noted that Ronald Reagan ran unsuccessfully for president twice before being elected in his third attempt \"and was stronger for it.\" In contrast with Romney, Pawlenty said, \"the emerging class of Republican candidates is untested and unproven.\"<\/p><p>Within Romney's political network, there has been informal chatter about a third run since early 2013, according to people familiar with the discussions. It bubbled up in phone calls and at dinners and has gained steam this year. Requests continue to pour in for him to appear on the campaign trail, and advisers said he is eager to mount a multi-state fly-around swing before Nov. 4.<\/p><p>In Iowa, however, Romney seemed uncomfortable with the 2016 talk. At the West Des Moines rally, he spoke for only five minutes, criticizing President Obama on income inequality, foreign affairs and other issues. When reporters tried to question him afterward, he sneaked into a dark maze of cubicles.<\/p><p>He also said that now that he was no longer a candidate, he had a joke to share involving Obama, golfer Phil Mickelson and tennis great Andre Agassi.<\/p><p>As Romney told it, Obama shows up at a bank to cash a check without his ID. The teller asks him to prove who he is, saying that Mickelson proved his identity by hitting a golf ball into a cup and Agassi proved his by hitting a tennis ball at a target. \"Is there anything you can do to prove who you are?\" the teller asks.<\/p><p>\"I don't have a clue,\" Obama replies in the joke.<\/p><p>The crowd ate it up.<\/p><p>Former aides and senior Republicans say Romney appreciates the GOP masses crowing that he was right about issues such as Russia and health care. But what really intrigues him, they said, are the vulnerabilities among top-tier candidates in the Republican field. If Romney moves toward a race, it would be because he sees a path to victory.<\/p><p>\"It's the market pulling him,\" said Kent Lucken, a longtime friend and adviser who accompanied Romney to Iowa. \"People look at Hillary as the likely Democratic nominee, and the party needs a strong leader who can stand up to her and who's been through the process.\"<\/p><p>Romney is returning to Boston on Tuesday for a dinner that he and his wife, Ann, are hosting for former campaign advisers and business associates.

Romney visited Sept. 23 with Joe Ricketts, a billionaire investor who finances the Ending Spending super PAC, at Ricketts's palatial penthouse apartment covering the entire 78th floor of the Time Warner Center in New York.<\/p><p>On Oct. 6, Romney also took part in a GOP fundraising dinner at the Manhattan apartment of Woody Johnson, the New York Jets owner and former Romney campaign finance chairman. Several 2016 hopefuls gave presentations to the donors, while Romney served as a co-host and made no pitch.<\/p><p>At Johnson's home, Romney and media magnate Rupert Murdoch spoke about Romney's political future. According to two Romney allies familiar with the conversation, Romney was cagey with Murdoch but expressed concerns about the developing GOP field. Romney told Murdoch that he felt uneasy about the party's non-interventionist drift on foreign policy and the base's embrace of ideological hard-liners.<\/p><p>Many Romney boosters believe that his window of opportunity will be in mid- to late 2015, should Sens. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) or Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) ascend and party establishment types turn to Romney as a savior.<\/p><p>If former Florida governor Jeb Bush (R) opts out of a campaign, \"there is going to be more pressure on Mitt to go,\" said Tom Rath, an influential New Hampshire Republican.<\/p><p>At a luncheon this month in Atlanta to help GOP Senate nominee David Perdue, \"people sat up and paid attention\" to Romney, said Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.). \"I pulled him aside afterward to thank him for coming. He said he's not running, and I take him at his word. But I don't think the door is entirely closed, and circumstances can change.\"<\/p><p>That phrase \u2014 \"circumstances can change\" \u2014 has been repeated by many Romney backers since the former nominee used it to describe his own thinking about 2016 in a radio interview last month with Hugh Hewitt.<\/p><p>Spencer Zwick, Romney's former national finance chairman, talks regularly with Romney and said he has been receiving daily calls from donors and other supporters. \"There are still plenty of donors who hope circumstances will change and there will be an opportunity for Romney to run again,\" he said.<\/p><p>Zwick is part of a slimmed-down inner circle, including longtime advisers Beth Myers, Peter Flaherty, Stuart Stevens, Lanhee Chen and aides Kelli Harrison and Matt Waldrip, who are advising Romney on political activities this fall.<\/p><p>Romney traveled through Iowa with three trusted advisers and friends: David Kochel, Ron Kaufman and Lucken. He also reunited with supporters from campaigns past. In Cedar Rapids, Romney spotted Jim Wilson, a Virginia man who logged more than 40,000 miles chasing the GOP nominee from coast to coast in his campaign-festooned GMC pickup. The two hugged. \"You son of a gun,\" Romney said.<\/p><p>Another fan, Gary Chidester, 64, came to the West Des Moines rally with a full coterie of Romney paraphernalia for the former candidate to autograph: campaign placards, enlarged photographs and buttons of Mitt and wife Ann, and paperback and audio copies of Romney's book \"No Apology.\" He also held a framed drawing that a friend gave him of a black cruise ship named Obama sinking into the sea and a white ship named Romney with the caption, \"We're here to save you.\"<\/p><p>\"He's the only qualified person to run this time,\" Chidester said. \"Mitt is a business genius. That's why I've listened to this tape three times. He had it all down \u2014 he had Russia down, he had the debt down \u2014 and all the other Republicans are novices by comparison.\"","163":"A federal judge Friday denied a Native American tribe's request for a temporary restraining order to halt construction on the controversial Dakota Access Pipeline.

My bad; I forgot that society no longer has common sense.<\/p><p>6 years ago my brother was found dead in his apartment. The only explanation the coroner gave my family was that his heart \"just stopped\", and it was most likely due to the fact that he had been drinking what you call \"energy cocktails\" with friends the night before (red bull and vodka). Drinking these things doesnt just affect your decision making skills, or cause anxiety disorders, IT CAN KILL YOU.<\/p><p>PLEASE, everybody who reads this, remember uppers and downers DO NOT MIX<\/p><p>Why? This trend has happened in the past too with other stimulants. Stimulants with depressants have a synergistic effect in some cases trippling the effect of one or the other which can have deadly consequences. The people using these combinations, one need to grow up and stop mixing drinks like little kids at a coolaid party and two wake up before they cannot wake up...they mix drinks for attention and some mystical edge that those flakes think they get from mixing energy drinks and alcohol....sad.<\/p><p>Energy drinks are disgusting. Why would anyone mix them with alcohol?<\/p><p>When i was in college we would routinly drink all night long taking caffine pills through out to stay up. Its a lot of fun, I had such good times in college, I miss it. We would also inhale aerosol room deoderizers. That just made you kinda pass out and fall down, so not as much fun. I found that if I drank all night with the caffine pills I could smoke a one hitter just before going to sleep and I wouldnt have a hangover when I woke up. I could start the process over when I woke up. I did this 5-6 nights a week on average. I graduated with a 3.4 gpa and now I have a great job making 93k per year. So there really isnt any harm in this behavior.<\/p><p>Another misleading study. Forget that the people that drink energy drinks and alcohol together are just more riskier.

God forbid they are morons without the combination of the two.<\/p><p>alcohol + energy drinks = a great time!<\/p><p>Alcohol must be necessary to cut the awful taste of the energy drinks.<\/p><p>One major flaw in this study. Are the people who partake in this risky behaviour, including mixing caffiene and alcohol, more prone to this type of behaviour to begin with?<\/p><p>As a former \"cherry bomb\", vodka-red bull, and jager-bomb drinker, I can appreciate the feeling you get when you drink caffiene and liquor. I never did anything extra risky when clubing and drinking these beverages. I also am not prone to risky behaviour other than the rare binge drinking.<\/p><p>Gee what do you know... more things that are bad for you!! What a bogus study. Too much of anything harmful to your body is going to do damage. I for one love the combo but only in moderation. Risky behavior... Give me a break! Driving your car or even going to a party or club is \"risky\" behavior. With all the sickos in the world today, no one is ever safe. Always be aware of your surroundings and always in moderation.<\/p><p>This article reminded me that I had a 5 hr energy drink in my computer bag. Thanks! that just saved my afternoon.<\/p><p>Also, I drank 2 \u2013 5hr energies at a party last weekend and had a blast. Caffeine is what makes the world go round and alcohol makes the world a cooler place. So if my logic is correct the two combined are a match made in heaven.

The fact remains, risk increases, not decreases.<\/p><p>It's always interesting to hear from those who justify questionable activity, whether or not it has been definitively determined to be risky. It usually begins with the phrase '...I like..', as if the ends, the effect, justifies the means, the unknown mixture, regardless of the actual risks, usually unknown.<\/p><p>Well, some people like pit bulls, some like shooting AK's at wildlife, some like driving SUV's like sports cars, but, none of those are conducive to low risk, great decisions or desirable behavior.<\/p><p>The operative word here is MAY. This is not a definitive study and, therefore, any conclusions are not empirical.<\/p><p>Two of the worst hangovers I have ever had were the result of just 2 or 3 vodka-redbulls...

[not] conducive to low risk, great decisions or desirable behavior\" I have a pitbull. They are VERY loving and loyal dogs. Even a poodle who is raised wrong can cause great injury to a person. I think it's irresponsible to use owning a pitbull to try and make a point about reckless behavior. You are just spreading the hate. ANY dog raised in a sick environment can turn out dangerous.<\/p><p>Sometimes I will have an energy beer, or do some various 'bomb' containing redbull and something 80-proof.

But when she was brought back, tests showed she had no detectable traces of the virus in her body. Twelve years and no drugs later, it is still undetectable \u2013 although experience has shown that does not mean there is not a hidden reservoir.<\/p><p>There are people known as \"elite controllers\" whose immune systems appear to keep the virus at bay, but according to Dr Asier S\u00e1ez-Ciri\u00f3n, of the HIV, inflammation and persistence unit at the Institut Pasteur in Paris, the Frenchwoman does not have the genetic factors associated with those. \"Most likely she has been in virological remission for so long because she received a combination of antiretrovirals very soon after infection.\"<\/p><p>That happened with a group of 14 adults in France, known as the Visconti cohort. They were treated with drugs soon after infection and all except two still have no detectable virus, even though they stopped taking the drugs years ago. Scientists think early treatment may limit the development of reservoirs of HIV and preserve the body's immune system defences.<\/p><p>S\u00e1ez-Ciri\u00f3n said there were 580 people in France who contracted HIV as babies, of whom about 100 were given drug treatment within the first six months of life. Of those, 15 stopped treatment, but the virus rebounded within weeks or months in 13 of them. Of the two remaining, one lasted for three years without needing drugs and the other is the young woman who has been off treatment for 12 years.<\/p><p>She has a healthy life with no complications, but this girl is not cured. We're talking about remission<\/p><p>\"She is doing perfectly well,\" said S\u00e1ez-Ciri\u00f3n. \"She has a healthy life with no complications.\" But he added: \"Very clearly this girl is not cured. We're talking about remission.\"<\/p><p>The case was presented at the eighth International Aids Society (IAS) Conference on HIV pathogenesis, treatment and prevention. Prof Sharon Lewin, director of the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity at the University of Melbourne in Australia, said she thought it was interesting, but added: \"We really need to move beyond these anecdotal cases in our quest for a cure \u2026 the child received medication early after birth. We don't know whether she would have controlled the virus anyway without receiving the medication. About 1% of people can do that.\"<\/p><p>Lewin, a member of the IAS Global Initiative Towards an HIV Cure, said trials were needed. It was universally recognised that people with HIV should be put on treatment as soon as possible after diagnosis. Itwas possible that some who had been treated early in their infection might be able to stop taking the drugs, but that had to be properly tested.<\/p><p>\"The only way we can address this is in a trial where we start a group of people very early on treatment and then randomise them to stop,\" she said. \"These studies are happening in Thailand at the moment.

Twelve years and no drugs later, it is still undetectable \u2013 although experience has shown that does not mean there is not a hidden reservoir.<\/p><p>There are people known as \"elite controllers\" whose immune systems appear to keep the virus at bay, but according to Dr Asier S\u00e1ez-Ciri\u00f3n, of the HIV, inflammation and persistence unit at the Institut Pasteur in Paris, the Frenchwoman does not have the genetic factors associated with those. \"Most likely she has been in virological remission for so long because she received a combination of antiretrovirals very soon after infection.\"<\/p><p>That happened with a group of 14 adults in France, known as the Visconti cohort. They were treated with drugs soon after infection and all except two still have no detectable virus, even though they stopped taking the drugs years ago. Scientists think early treatment may limit the development of reservoirs of HIV and preserve the body's immune system defences.<\/p><p>S\u00e1ez-Ciri\u00f3n said there were 580 people in France who contracted HIV as babies, of whom about 100 were given drug treatment within the first six months of life. Of those, 15 stopped treatment, but the virus rebounded within weeks or months in 13 of them. Of the two remaining, one lasted for three years without needing drugs and the other is the young woman who has been off treatment for 12 years.<\/p><p>She has a healthy life with no complications, but this girl is not cured.

Prof Sharon Lewin, director of the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity at the University of Melbourne in Australia, said she thought it was interesting, but added: \"We really need to move beyond these anecdotal cases in our quest for a cure \u2026 the child received medication early after birth. We don't know whether she would have controlled the virus anyway without receiving the medication.

It was universally recognised that people with HIV should be put on treatment as soon as possible after diagnosis. Itwas possible that some who had been treated early in their infection might be able to stop taking the drugs, but that had to be properly tested.<\/p><p>\"The only way we can address this is in a trial where we start a group of people very early on treatment and then randomise them to stop,\" she said. \"These studies are happening in Thailand at the moment.

Gonna blame that on Bush too? like the democrats even said, a few billion is a drop in the bucket. so whats your beef, when we have a 17T, and someone actually tries to do something about it?<\/p><p>The shutdown forced hundreds of thousands of federal employees and contractors out of work, put government contracts on hold, shuttered national parks and museums and left businesses with fewer customers and lower sales. It's too early to know the final cost of those and other effects, but analysts at IHS Global Insight said the hit to gross domestic product from lost government services alone totals $3.1 billion.<\/p><p>no it put them on furlough, they still get paid for the time they didn't work. again, going to cry about 3 billion? to pay back on the interest is close to a trillion alone, what about that? There will also be some impact from lost private-sector jobs tied to the shutdown, as well as a loss of consumer and business confidence resulting from the debt-ceiling showdown,\" IHS economists wrote in an analysis released to the media. \"The exact impact on the rest of the economy will be hard to measure until delayed economic data are released.\"<\/p><p>what do you think it will be when we can no longer raise our borrowing limit? Even before that data becomes available, analysts at Standard & Poor's estimated that the shutdown cost $24 billion (or $1.5 billion a day) and slowed the country's economic growth rate by an annualized 0.6 percent for the current quarter.<\/p><p>what have other failed programs, cost us? post some of those. funny I don't hear you call foul and point out that when Nodumbo and his band of thieves left Bush tax cuts in place for (what was it 3 years), and then threw in employment and R&D incentives how it hit revenue in the belt? well, you must have forgot how the R&D incentive had not only big business defense contractors, mostly pay in next to nothing and in some get money back from the tax payer huh?<\/p><p>There will also be some impact from lost private-sector jobs tied to the shutdown, as well as a loss of consumer and business confidence resulting from the debt-ceiling showdown,\" IHS economists wrote in an analysis released to the media. \"The exact impact on the rest of the economy will be hard to measure until delayed economic data are released.\" Even before that data becomes available, analysts at Standard & Poor's estimated that the shutdown cost $24 billion (or $1.5 billion a day) and slowed the country's economic growth rate by an annualized 0.6 percent for the current quarter.<\/p><p>yet before those number are released your just gonna banter on and on?<\/p><p>\"The bottom line is the government shutdown has hurt the U.S. economy,\" S&P said in a statement. \"In September, we expected 3 percent annualized growth in the fourth quarter because we thought politicians would have learned from 2011 and taken steps to avoid things like a government shutdown and the possibility of a sovereign default. Since our forecast didn't hold, we now have to lower our fourth-quarter growth estimate to closer to 2 percent.\" The Washington, D.C. region was hit especially hard. Some local businesses took a major blow since there were fewer tourists and workers shopping and dining out during the shutdown. Pete's Diner on Capitol Hill, a favorite of many members of Congress including House Speaker John Boehner, lost about 80 percent of its usual business, according to MSN. Businesses like that diner, located in communities hit hard by the federal government shutdown, will never be able to make that money back. \"While the federal workers will receive their back pay, the missed coffee, burgers and cocktails will not be repurchased upon their return,\" Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank, said in a statement.<\/p><p>since when did you care about small business? an idiot can see the ACA is going to kill small business, and those that don't fail will have to raise cost, costing the taxpayers plenty. where is your gripe about losss of revenue, because senate and congress get a 72% insurance subsidy? where again is your complaint with loopeholes for big business? where is your complaint that the middle class is going to bear the burden with tax hikes, insurance premiums, and unfair payments, and return subsidy for paying in? funny I work for a government contractor... I still have a job, my insurance is going thru the roof after the 1st of the year, and my out of pocket along with it... where is your complaint that with all this increase, it will put more middle class lower wage earners, on the taxpayer tab, because that loss hits them when it comes to food and paying for gas and electric? They will have to apply for food and energy assistance (the ones who were scraping by as it was) because they can not afford to feed themselves or keep a light on.<\/p><p>if you, and your ilk were not so ignorant to the obvious (might be because you never worked a day in your life) you would see what this is costing the middle class, and it hasn't even gone into effect yet, because they cant get the program up and running due to outdated equipment... where your complaint on that? heck, millions of Americans cant log on to check whats out there... I don't hear you crying about the hundreds of millions, now going to be in the billions, because the whole thing will have to be scrapped and started over. go on... let us hear foul on that!<\/p><p>But the shutdown's impact was felt well beyond the nation's capital. According to a new survey by International Council of Shopping Centers and Goldman Sachs (GS +0.23%, news), about 40 percent of Americans say they had curbed spending as a result of the shutdown. The survey found that low-income consumers were especially likely to say the shutdown affected their behavior. Nearly half of those earning $35,000 or less said they scaled back their spending, versus about a third of respondents making $100,000 or more.<\/p><p>well, shucks of course it will affect low income earners behavior! their government benefits are at stake. they have to scale back on spending for reasons such as food share dropped a good chunk, as well as energy assistance. means they have more out of pocket costs.

Like the so-called Mississippi baby, she became infected before birth and received drug treatment in the first weeks of her life.<\/p><p>Both children were denied follow-up care when their parents took them out of medical treatment and did not give them the prescribed drugs. The case of the US child caused huge excitement when the infant was brought back to the University of Mississippi medical centre in Jackson. Doctors talked in terms of a \"functional cure\", because the child had no detectable virus.<\/p><p>However, the remission lasted only 27 months before the viral levels rose again in the child's body. HIV scientists confessed to disappointment, although they said they would learn a huge amount from the case.<\/p><p>This time there is more caution. It is the first case of long-term remission in a child, say the French team, but they accept that it may not be permanent.<\/p><p>The child was born to a woman with untreated HIV and was given a drug for six weeks after her birth to try to prevent infection, but to no avail. Two months after the prophylactic drug was stopped, tests showed the infant had a high viral load and she was put on a cocktail of three antiretroviral medicines, which is the standard treatment for HIV.<\/p><p>When the girl was six years old, the family decided to stop the drugs and for six months doctors did not have contact with her. But when she was brought back, tests showed she had no detectable traces of the virus in her body. Twelve years and no drugs later, it is still undetectable \u2013 although experience has shown that does not mean there is not a hidden reservoir.<\/p><p>There are people known as \"elite controllers\" whose immune systems appear to keep the virus at bay, but according to Dr Asier S\u00e1ez-Ciri\u00f3n, of the HIV, inflammation and persistence unit at the Institut Pasteur in Paris, the Frenchwoman does not have the genetic factors associated with those. \"Most likely she has been in virological remission for so long because she received a combination of antiretrovirals very soon after infection.\"<\/p><p>That happened with a group of 14 adults in France, known as the Visconti cohort. They were treated with drugs soon after infection and all except two still have no detectable virus, even though they stopped taking the drugs years ago. Scientists think early treatment may limit the development of reservoirs of HIV and preserve the body's immune system defences.<\/p><p>S\u00e1ez-Ciri\u00f3n said there were 580 people in France who contracted HIV as babies, of whom about 100 were given drug treatment within the first six months of life. Of those, 15 stopped treatment, but the virus rebounded within weeks or months in 13 of them. Of the two remaining, one lasted for three years without needing drugs and the other is the young woman who has been off treatment for 12 years.<\/p><p>She has a healthy life with no complications, but this girl is not cured. We're talking about remission<\/p><p>\"She is doing perfectly well,\" said S\u00e1ez-Ciri\u00f3n. \"She has a healthy life with no complications.\" But he added: \"Very clearly this girl is not cured. We're talking about remission.\"<\/p><p>The case was presented at the eighth International Aids Society (IAS) Conference on HIV pathogenesis, treatment and prevention. Prof Sharon Lewin, director of the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity at the University of Melbourne in Australia, said she thought it was interesting, but added: \"We really need to move beyond these anecdotal cases in our quest for a cure \u2026 the child received medication early after birth. We don't know whether she would have controlled the virus anyway without receiving the medication. About 1% of people can do that.\"<\/p><p>Lewin, a member of the IAS Global Initiative Towards an HIV Cure, said trials were needed. It was universally recognised that people with HIV should be put on treatment as soon as possible after diagnosis. Itwas possible that some who had been treated early in their infection might be able to stop taking the drugs, but that had to be properly tested.<\/p><p>\"The only way we can address this is in a trial where we start a group of people very early on treatment and then randomise them to stop,\" she said. \"These studies are happening in Thailand at the moment. They are going to be really informative.\"","203":"Notice ACA Kalpone.....you make claims then only name call....just another name caller day in and out ACA!

Like the so-called Mississippi baby, she became infected before birth and received drug treatment in the first weeks of her life.<\/p><p>Both children were denied follow-up care when their parents took them out of medical treatment and did not give them the prescribed drugs. The case of the US child caused huge excitement when the infant was brought back to the University of Mississippi medical centre in Jackson. Doctors talked in terms of a \"functional cure\", because the child had no detectable virus.<\/p><p>However, the remission lasted only 27 months before the viral levels rose again in the child's body. HIV scientists confessed to disappointment, although they said they would learn a huge amount from the case.<\/p><p>This time there is more caution. It is the first case of long-term remission in a child, say the French team, but they accept that it may not be permanent.<\/p><p>The child was born to a woman with untreated HIV and was given a drug for six weeks after her birth to try to prevent infection, but to no avail. Two months after the prophylactic drug was stopped, tests showed the infant had a high viral load and she was put on a cocktail of three antiretroviral medicines, which is the standard treatment for HIV.<\/p><p>When the girl was six years old, the family decided to stop the drugs and for six months doctors did not have contact with her. But when she was brought back, tests showed she had no detectable traces of the virus in her body. Twelve years and no drugs later, it is still undetectable \u2013 although experience has shown that does not mean there is not a hidden reservoir.<\/p><p>There are people known as \"elite controllers\" whose immune systems appear to keep the virus at bay, but according to Dr Asier S\u00e1ez-Ciri\u00f3n, of the HIV, inflammation and persistence unit at the Institut Pasteur in Paris, the Frenchwoman does not have the genetic factors associated with those. \"Most likely she has been in virological remission for so long because she received a combination of antiretrovirals very soon after infection.\"<\/p><p>That happened with a group of 14 adults in France, known as the Visconti cohort. They were treated with drugs soon after infection and all except two still have no detectable virus, even though they stopped taking the drugs years ago. Scientists think early treatment may limit the development of reservoirs of HIV and preserve the body's immune system defences.<\/p><p>S\u00e1ez-Ciri\u00f3n said there were 580 people in France who contracted HIV as babies, of whom about 100 were given drug treatment within the first six months of life. Of those, 15 stopped treatment, but the virus rebounded within weeks or months in 13 of them. Of the two remaining, one lasted for three years without needing drugs and the other is the young woman who has been off treatment for 12 years.<\/p><p>She has a healthy life with no complications, but this girl is not cured. We're talking about remission<\/p><p>\"She is doing perfectly well,\" said S\u00e1ez-Ciri\u00f3n. \"She has a healthy life with no complications.\" But he added: \"Very clearly this girl is not cured.

Even before that data becomes available, analysts at Standard & Poor's estimated that the shutdown cost $24 billion (or $1.5 billion a day) and slowed the country's economic growth rate by an annualized 0.6 percent for the current quarter.<\/p><p>what have other failed programs, cost us? post some of those. funny I don't hear you call foul and point out that when Nodumbo and his band of thieves left Bush tax cuts in place for (what was it 3 years), and then threw in employment and R&D incentives how it hit revenue in the belt? well, you must have forgot how the R&D incentive had not only big business defense contractors, mostly pay in next to nothing and in some get money back from the tax payer huh?<\/p><p>There will also be some impact from lost private-sector jobs tied to the shutdown, as well as a loss of consumer and business confidence resulting from the debt-ceiling showdown,\" IHS economists wrote in an analysis released to the media. \"The exact impact on the rest of the economy will be hard to measure until delayed economic data are released.\" Even before that data becomes available, analysts at Standard & Poor's estimated that the shutdown cost $24 billion (or $1.5 billion a day) and slowed the country's economic growth rate by an annualized 0.6 percent for the current quarter.<\/p><p>yet before those number are released your just gonna banter on and on?<\/p><p>\"The bottom line is the government shutdown has hurt the U.S. economy,\" S&P said in a statement. \"In September, we expected 3 percent annualized growth in the fourth quarter because we thought politicians would have learned from 2011 and taken steps to avoid things like a government shutdown and the possibility of a sovereign default. Since our forecast didn't hold, we now have to lower our fourth-quarter growth estimate to closer to 2 percent.\" The Washington, D.C. region was hit especially hard. Some local businesses took a major blow since there were fewer tourists and workers shopping and dining out during the shutdown. Pete's Diner on Capitol Hill, a favorite of many members of Congress including House Speaker John Boehner, lost about 80 percent of its usual business, according to MSN. Businesses like that diner, located in communities hit hard by the federal government shutdown, will never be able to make that money back. \"While the federal workers will receive their back pay, the missed coffee, burgers and cocktails will not be repurchased upon their return,\" Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank, said in a statement.<\/p><p>since when did you care about small business? an idiot can see the ACA is going to kill small business, and those that don't fail will have to raise cost, costing the taxpayers plenty. where is your gripe about losss of revenue, because senate and congress get a 72% insurance subsidy? where again is your complaint with loopeholes for big business? where is your complaint that the middle class is going to bear the burden with tax hikes, insurance premiums, and unfair payments, and return subsidy for paying in? funny I work for a government contractor... I still have a job, my insurance is going thru the roof after the 1st of the year, and my out of pocket along with it... where is your complaint that with all this increase, it will put more middle class lower wage earners, on the taxpayer tab, because that loss hits them when it comes to food and paying for gas and electric? They will have to apply for food and energy assistance (the ones who were scraping by as it was) because they can not afford to feed themselves or keep a light on.<\/p><p>if you, and your ilk were not so ignorant to the obvious (might be because you never worked a day in your life) you would see what this is costing the middle class, and it hasn't even gone into effect yet, because they cant get the program up and running due to outdated equipment... where your complaint on that? heck, millions of Americans cant log on to check whats out there... I don't hear you crying about the hundreds of millions, now going to be in the billions, because the whole thing will have to be scrapped and started over. go on... let us hear foul on that!<\/p><p>But the shutdown's impact was felt well beyond the nation's capital. According to a new survey by International Council of Shopping Centers and Goldman Sachs (GS +0.23%, news), about 40 percent of Americans say they had curbed spending as a result of the shutdown. The survey found that low-income consumers were especially likely to say the shutdown affected their behavior. Nearly half of those earning $35,000 or less said they scaled back their spending, versus about a third of respondents making $100,000 or more.<\/p><p>well, shucks of course it will affect low income earners behavior! their government benefits are at stake. they have to scale back on spending for reasons such as food share dropped a good chunk, as well as energy assistance. means they have more out of pocket costs. All this you have mentioned if Nodumbo would have least tried to work on spending, and making sure the ACA was ready to go forward for funding, BTW it still is not.","216":"A French teenager who was infected with HIV as a baby and given intensive drug therapy in early childhood has lived for more than 12 years without any treatment, raising hopes among scientists searching for a cure for Aids.<\/p><p>The case of the 18-year-old was presented at an Aids conference in Vancouver, Canada, by doctors at the Institut Pasteur who treated her. Like the so-called Mississippi baby, she became infected before birth and received drug treatment in the first weeks of her life.<\/p><p>Both children were denied follow-up care when their parents took them out of medical treatment and did not give them the prescribed drugs. The case of the US child caused huge excitement when the infant was brought back to the University of Mississippi medical centre in Jackson. Doctors talked in terms of a \"functional cure\", because the child had no detectable virus.<\/p><p>However, the remission lasted only 27 months before the viral levels rose again in the child's body. HIV scientists confessed to disappointment, although they said they would learn a huge amount from the case.<\/p><p>This time there is more caution. It is the first case of long-term remission in a child, say the French team, but they accept that it may not be permanent.<\/p><p>The child was born to a woman with untreated HIV and was given a drug for six weeks after her birth to try to prevent infection, but to no avail. Two months after the prophylactic drug was stopped, tests showed the infant had a high viral load and she was put on a cocktail of three antiretroviral medicines, which is the standard treatment for HIV.<\/p><p>When the girl was six years old, the family decided to stop the drugs and for six months doctors did not have contact with her. But when she was brought back, tests showed she had no detectable traces of the virus in her body. Twelve years and no drugs later, it is still undetectable \u2013 although experience has shown that does not mean there is not a hidden reservoir.<\/p><p>There are people known as \"elite controllers\" whose immune systems appear to keep the virus at bay, but according to Dr Asier S\u00e1ez-Ciri\u00f3n, of the HIV, inflammation and persistence unit at the Institut Pasteur in Paris, the Frenchwoman does not have the genetic factors associated with those. \"Most likely she has been in virological remission for so long because she received a combination of antiretrovirals very soon after infection.\"<\/p><p>That happened with a group of 14 adults in France, known as the Visconti cohort. They were treated with drugs soon after infection and all except two still have no detectable virus, even though they stopped taking the drugs years ago. Scientists think early treatment may limit the development of reservoirs of HIV and preserve the body's immune system defences.<\/p><p>S\u00e1ez-Ciri\u00f3n said there were 580 people in France who contracted HIV as babies, of whom about 100 were given drug treatment within the first six months of life. Of those, 15 stopped treatment, but the virus rebounded within weeks or months in 13 of them. Of the two remaining, one lasted for three years without needing drugs and the other is the young woman who has been off treatment for 12 years.<\/p><p>She has a healthy life with no complications, but this girl is not cured. We're talking about remission<\/p><p>\"She is doing perfectly well,\" said S\u00e1ez-Ciri\u00f3n. \"She has a healthy life with no complications.\" But he added: \"Very clearly this girl is not cured. We're talking about remission.\"<\/p><p>The case was presented at the eighth International Aids Society (IAS) Conference on HIV pathogenesis, treatment and prevention. Prof Sharon Lewin, director of the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity at the University of Melbourne in Australia, said she thought it was interesting, but added: \"We really need to move beyond these anecdotal cases in our quest for a cure \u2026 the child received medication early after birth. We don't know whether she would have controlled the virus anyway without receiving the medication. About 1% of people can do that.\"<\/p><p>Lewin, a member of the IAS Global Initiative Towards an HIV Cure, said trials were needed. It was universally recognised that people with HIV should be put on treatment as soon as possible after diagnosis. Itwas possible that some who had been treated early in their infection might be able to stop taking the drugs, but that had to be properly tested.<\/p><p>\"The only way we can address this is in a trial where we start a group of people very early on treatment and then randomise them to stop,\" she said. \"These studies are happening in Thailand at the moment. They are going to be really informative.\"","217":"Social gaming isn't just a diversion anymore.

It's fun even if you just watch.<\/p><p>Getting there: Samana is two to three hours from Puerto Plata or the main airport in Santo Domingo.<\/p><p>By Larry Olmsted Special for, USA TODAY<\/p><p>has long been a favorite of U.S. and international buyers, thanks to plentiful beaches and high-quality golf courses, high-end developments coupled with affordable prices, and a stable, democratic government.<\/p><p>Forty years ago, the nation's first developed tourism area was around Puerto Plata and Cabarete on the northern coast. But for the past two decades, the north has been largely overshadowed by the southeast, especially La Romana and the heavily developed Punta Cana peninsula.<\/p><p>Now, thanks to infrastructure improvements and the simple desire to find the next hot place, second-home buyers are heading back north, spurred by the development of the Saman\u00e1 Peninsula. A new highway, part of a huge ongoing government infrastructure investment, links Saman\u00e1 with the capital, Santo Domingo, and has dramatically reduced travel time from more than five hours to under 2\u00bd.<\/p><p>The newly emerging Saman\u00e1 Peninsula began as a second-home destination for Dominicans but is increasingly being \"discovered\" by overseas buyers.<\/p><p>\"On the south of the peninsula, the biggest city is Saman\u00e1, which has the cruise dock and several new developments, the largest of which is Puerto Bahia, attracting more Dominican buyers,\" says Pedro Purcell, a broker with Dominican Properties in Santo Domingo.<\/p><p>\"The two highest-profile developments are on the north, Balcones del Atl\u00e1ntico and El Portillo. There are more American buyers in the north, as well as French, Germans and Italians.<\/p><p>\"Unlike Punta Cana, Saman\u00e1 is mostly condos, not the big villas and estate homes, and it is not as expensive as Cap Cana or Casa de Campo to the south, where people look for celebrities,\" Purcell adds.<\/p><p>\"Here, they look for the beach lifestyle, and while the projects are high-quality, they are not nearly as large as in the Punta Cana area.\"<\/p><p>A look at three North Shore neighborhoods<\/p><p>\u2022 Puerto Plata. The Dominican Republic's first major tourism enclave, this beach town has a lot of hotel and restaurant development, but with few second homes besides Seahorse Ranch, which was built in the 1980s. The gated 250-acre equestrian and beach community has more than 100 private homes ranging from $500,000 to $8 million. The Victoria Hotel within the Playa Dorado golf resort here plans to begin offering a fractional ownership club this year.<\/p><p>\u2022 Cabarete. Less developed than Puerto Plata, beach-centric Cabarete has until recently attracted mainly European buyers. That is about to change with the transformation of the Playa Grande golf course \u2014 known as \"the Pebble Beach of the Caribbean\" \u2014 into a high-end residential community. It will include an equestrian center, clubhouse and recreational facilities, with villas and estate houses on sale later this year. Luxury Asian developer Aman is also planning a private enclave of residential villas here.<\/p><p>\u2022 Samana Peninsula. Several towns on this 40-mile-long peninsula are seeing development, but for U.S. buyers, the runaway favorite is Las Terrenas. Already home to several boutique hotels, the longtime fishing village is emerging as a culinary hotspot, with European chefs taking advantage of the seafood. A 66-acre former coconut plantation, Las Terrenas' Balcones del Atlantico will have 350 residences, from apartments to beach villas, from $475,000 to $1.7 million.

They are not close, the Russian and the American, whom she has not managed to beat since 2004, when she prevailed in the final at Wimbledon, aged 17.<\/p><p>For an hour or so on Tuesday, however, the schadenfreude resided with the chastened world No1 back in Miami, as the lean-limbed young Spanish upstart looked like adding Sharapova to her short but impressive hit list of celebrity take-downs.<\/p><p>She was poised to embarrass the faltering seventh seed after a first-set blitz of powerful, confident hitting from all angles, but the grind got to her. Sharapova, as she has done now in her past 18 three-setters on clay (and 25 of 26 overall), was too strong of mind and body over the longer distance, taking a tick over two hours to win 1-6, 7-5, 6-1.<\/p><p>So the tournament gets the glamour semi-final it craved: Sharapova, thrashed by Williams in last year's final, against the rising Canadian Eugenie Bouchard, who had a marginally tougher time of it on Court Suzanne Lenglen. She held off the spirited challenge of another Spaniard, the 14th seed Carla Su\u00e1rez Navarro, to win 7-6, 2-6, 7-5 in two hours and 22 minutes, and bootleg seats on Court Philippe Chatrier for their match on Thursday will sell like those along the catwalk in Milan.<\/p><p>Muguruza, in her first slam quarter-final and with nothing to lose, came close to securing a footnote in the game's history as the first player to beat both Sharapova and Williams in the same slam. However, Muguruza's tennis disintegrated into shards of overcooked groundstrokes as the fist-pumping diva at the other end again dipped into her considerable reserves of determination.<\/p><p>On Lenglen shortly afterwards, Bouchard hit a double fault on match point but repaired the damage with a stunning cross-court backhand and tried again. As with Muguruza, Su\u00e1rez Navarro left the stage with a limp, netted backhand, struck single-handedly. Both are interesting players with big games. If they are to break through when it matters, though, they will have to cope with the added pressure of expectation. Bouchard has taken just 10 games off Sharapova in 30, baggage that will be hard to carry into the first semi-final. But, like Muguruza, she has nothing to lose.<\/p><p>Sharapova had difficulty later understanding a tweet by Andy Murray's mother, Judy, and swore she had no idea who she was.

Photograph: Kevork Djansezian\/Getty Images<\/p><p>The man accused of carrying out a shooting rampage at Los Angeles international airport (LAX) remained too wounded to answer questions on Sunday, as investigators pieced together chilling details about the attack and its possible motive.<\/p><p>Paul Ciancia, 23, an unemployed motorbike mechanic, shot a Transportation Security Administration (TSA) agent at point-blank range on Friday. He then rode up an escalator, seeking other targets, before looking back to see his first victim squirming on the ground. Ciancia returned and shot again, making Gerardo Hernandez, 39, a married father-of-two, the TSA's first fatality in the line of duty since the agency's creation after 9\/11.<\/p><p>The gunman carried a note which said he wished to kill as many TSA employees \"and pigs\" as possible, without racial discrimination, to \"instill fear into their traitorous minds\", FBI special agent in charge David Bowdich told reporters. The note singled out Janet Napolitano, a former head of homeland security, for abuse and cited \"NWO\", an apparent reference to a conspiracy theory about authoritarian government plotting a new world order.<\/p><p>Ciancia also wrote that he intended to die after killing at least one security officer, Reuters quoted the head of a key congressional security committee as saying on Sunday. He also discussed weaknesses in airport security in the \"suicide\" note before Friday's attack, Michael McCaul, the Republican chair of the House committee on homeland security, told CNN.<\/p><p>\"The other thing he wanted to talk about was how easy it is to bring a gun into an airport and do something just like he did,\" McCaul said of the note.<\/p><p>McCaul said the note allegedly written by Ciancia \"talks a lot about killing TSA agents, and he said, 'If I just kill one, my mission is accomplished.'\"<\/p><p>It was not immediately clear whether McCaul was referring to the same note as the one mentioned by the FBI, Reuters reported.<\/p><p>Ciancia, wearing an armoured vest, used a Smith & Wesson .223 caliber M&P-15 assault rifle to wound two other TSA agents and a passenger in a 10-minute shooting spree which spread panic through the world's sixth-busiest airport and disrupted thousands of flights.<\/p><p>Airport police cornered him near a Burger King in Terminal 3 and shot him in the leg and mouth, reportedly smashing his teeth and tongue. Ciancia managed to tell officials at the scene that a friend had driven him to LAX but that he had acted alone, according to the Associated Press.<\/p><p>A graphic photo in the New York Post showed Ciancia on the ground with a mangled face and beside pools of blood. By Saturday Ciancia, under guard at hospital, was \"unresponsive\" and could not be interviewed, said Bowdich. He was charged with first-degree murder and committing violence at an international airport and may face the death penalty.<\/p><p>Authorities believe the friend who dropped Ciancia off in a black Hyundai on Friday morning was unaware of his plan. Ciancia had no ticket or reservation.<\/p><p>Los Angeles police wore black armbands in tributes to Hernandez, the slain agent. He move to the US from El Salvador at the age of 15 and joined the TSA three years ago, routinely rising at 3am for his shift. His widow, Ana Hernandez, flanked by TSA chief John Pistole, told a press conference the family had lost a loving husband and father.<\/p><p>\"I am truly devastated,\" she said. Later she told NBC: \"He was always excited to go to work. He was a joyful person, he took pride in his duty for the American public and for the TSA mission.\"<\/p><p>The FBI said it had found no evidence that Ciancia consorted with radical groups but hoped to establish why he had a grudge against the TSA, said Bowdich. \"We are really going to draw a picture of who this person was, his background, his history. That will help us explain why he chose to do what he did. At this point, I don't have the answer on that.\"<\/p><p>Ciancia grew up in Pennsville, a blue-collar New Jersey suburb, and was described by former classmates as quiet and reserved. His father owned a successful garage. His mother died of multiple sclerosis in 2009. Two years later, Ciancia graduated from the Motorcycle Mechanics Institute in Orlando, which taught him to fix Harley-Davidsons. Soon after, he moved to Los Angeles.<\/p><p>He struggled to find work.

Photograph: Kevork Djansezian\/Getty Images<\/p><p>The man accused of carrying out a shooting rampage at Los Angeles international airport (LAX) remained too wounded to answer questions on Sunday, as investigators pieced together chilling details about the attack and its possible motive.<\/p><p>Paul Ciancia, 23, an unemployed motorbike mechanic, shot a Transportation Security Administration (TSA) agent at point-blank range on Friday. He then rode up an escalator, seeking other targets, before looking back to see his first victim squirming on the ground. Ciancia returned and shot again, making Gerardo Hernandez, 39, a married father-of-two, the TSA's first fatality in the line of duty since the agency's creation after 9\/11.<\/p><p>The gunman carried a note which said he wished to kill as many TSA employees \"and pigs\" as possible, without racial discrimination, to \"instill fear into their traitorous minds\", FBI special agent in charge David Bowdich told reporters. The note singled out Janet Napolitano, a former head of homeland security, for abuse and cited \"NWO\", an apparent reference to a conspiracy theory about authoritarian government plotting a new world order.<\/p><p>Ciancia also wrote that he intended to die after killing at least one security officer, Reuters quoted the head of a key congressional security committee as saying on Sunday. He also discussed weaknesses in airport security in the \"suicide\" note before Friday's attack, Michael McCaul, the Republican chair of the House committee on homeland security, told CNN.<\/p><p>\"The other thing he wanted to talk about was how easy it is to bring a gun into an airport and do something just like he did,\" McCaul said of the note.<\/p><p>McCaul said the note allegedly written by Ciancia \"talks a lot about killing TSA agents, and he said, 'If I just kill one, my mission is accomplished.'\"<\/p><p>It was not immediately clear whether McCaul was referring to the same note as the one mentioned by the FBI, Reuters reported.<\/p><p>Ciancia, wearing an armoured vest, used a Smith & Wesson .223 caliber M&P-15 assault rifle to wound two other TSA agents and a passenger in a 10-minute shooting spree which spread panic through the world's sixth-busiest airport and disrupted thousands of flights.<\/p><p>Airport police cornered him near a Burger King in Terminal 3 and shot him in the leg and mouth, reportedly smashing his teeth and tongue. Ciancia managed to tell officials at the scene that a friend had driven him to LAX but that he had acted alone, according to the Associated Press.<\/p><p>A graphic photo in the New York Post showed Ciancia on the ground with a mangled face and beside pools of blood. By Saturday Ciancia, under guard at hospital, was \"unresponsive\" and could not be interviewed, said Bowdich. He was charged with first-degree murder and committing violence at an international airport and may face the death penalty.<\/p><p>Authorities believe the friend who dropped Ciancia off in a black Hyundai on Friday morning was unaware of his plan. Ciancia had no ticket or reservation.<\/p><p>Los Angeles police wore black armbands in tributes to Hernandez, the slain agent. He move to the US from El Salvador at the age of 15 and joined the TSA three years ago, routinely rising at 3am for his shift. His widow, Ana Hernandez, flanked by TSA chief John Pistole, told a press conference the family had lost a loving husband and father.<\/p><p>\"I am truly devastated,\" she said. Later she told NBC: \"He was always excited to go to work. He was a joyful person, he took pride in his duty for the American public and for the TSA mission.\"<\/p><p>The FBI said it had found no evidence that Ciancia consorted with radical groups but hoped to establish why he had a grudge against the TSA, said Bowdich. \"We are really going to draw a picture of who this person was, his background, his history. That will help us explain why he chose to do what he did. At this point, I don't have the answer on that.\"<\/p><p>Ciancia grew up in Pennsville, a blue-collar New Jersey suburb, and was described by former classmates as quiet and reserved. His father owned a successful garage. His mother died of multiple sclerosis in 2009. Two years later, Ciancia graduated from the Motorcycle Mechanics Institute in Orlando, which taught him to fix Harley-Davidsons. Soon after, he moved to Los Angeles.<\/p><p>He struggled to find work.

Photograph: Kevork Djansezian\/Getty Images<\/p><p>The man accused of carrying out a shooting rampage at Los Angeles international airport (LAX) remained too wounded to answer questions on Sunday, as investigators pieced together chilling details about the attack and its possible motive.<\/p><p>Paul Ciancia, 23, an unemployed motorbike mechanic, shot a Transportation Security Administration (TSA) agent at point-blank range on Friday. He then rode up an escalator, seeking other targets, before looking back to see his first victim squirming on the ground. Ciancia returned and shot again, making Gerardo Hernandez, 39, a married father-of-two, the TSA's first fatality in the line of duty since the agency's creation after 9\/11.<\/p><p>The gunman carried a note which said he wished to kill as many TSA employees \"and pigs\" as possible, without racial discrimination, to \"instill fear into their traitorous minds\", FBI special agent in charge David Bowdich told reporters. The note singled out Janet Napolitano, a former head of homeland security, for abuse and cited \"NWO\", an apparent reference to a conspiracy theory about authoritarian government plotting a new world order.<\/p><p>Ciancia also wrote that he intended to die after killing at least one security officer, Reuters quoted the head of a key congressional security committee as saying on Sunday. He also discussed weaknesses in airport security in the \"suicide\" note before Friday's attack, Michael McCaul, the Republican chair of the House committee on homeland security, told CNN.<\/p><p>\"The other thing he wanted to talk about was how easy it is to bring a gun into an airport and do something just like he did,\" McCaul said of the note.<\/p><p>McCaul said the note allegedly written by Ciancia \"talks a lot about killing TSA agents, and he said, 'If I just kill one, my mission is accomplished.'\"<\/p><p>It was not immediately clear whether McCaul was referring to the same note as the one mentioned by the FBI, Reuters reported.<\/p><p>Ciancia, wearing an armoured vest, used a Smith & Wesson .223 caliber M&P-15 assault rifle to wound two other TSA agents and a passenger in a 10-minute shooting spree which spread panic through the world's sixth-busiest airport and disrupted thousands of flights.<\/p><p>Airport police cornered him near a Burger King in Terminal 3 and shot him in the leg and mouth, reportedly smashing his teeth and tongue. Ciancia managed to tell officials at the scene that a friend had driven him to LAX but that he had acted alone, according to the Associated Press.<\/p><p>A graphic photo in the New York Post showed Ciancia on the ground with a mangled face and beside pools of blood. By Saturday Ciancia, under guard at hospital, was \"unresponsive\" and could not be interviewed, said Bowdich. He was charged with first-degree murder and committing violence at an international airport and may face the death penalty.<\/p><p>Authorities believe the friend who dropped Ciancia off in a black Hyundai on Friday morning was unaware of his plan. Ciancia had no ticket or reservation.<\/p><p>Los Angeles police wore black armbands in tributes to Hernandez, the slain agent. He move to the US from El Salvador at the age of 15 and joined the TSA three years ago, routinely rising at 3am for his shift. His widow, Ana Hernandez, flanked by TSA chief John Pistole, told a press conference the family had lost a loving husband and father.<\/p><p>\"I am truly devastated,\" she said. Later she told NBC: \"He was always excited to go to work. He was a joyful person, he took pride in his duty for the American public and for the TSA mission.\"<\/p><p>The FBI said it had found no evidence that Ciancia consorted with radical groups but hoped to establish why he had a grudge against the TSA, said Bowdich. \"We are really going to draw a picture of who this person was, his background, his history. That will help us explain why he chose to do what he did. At this point, I don't have the answer on that.\"<\/p><p>Ciancia grew up in Pennsville, a blue-collar New Jersey suburb, and was described by former classmates as quiet and reserved. His father owned a successful garage. His mother died of multiple sclerosis in 2009. Two years later, Ciancia graduated from the Motorcycle Mechanics Institute in Orlando, which taught him to fix Harley-Davidsons. Soon after, he moved to Los Angeles.<\/p><p>He struggled to find work. Last week he alarmed siblings with texts suggesting he would would harm himself.","390":"JAE S. LEE \/ THE TENNESSEAN<\/p><p>In his new book, New Money: Staying Rich, former NFL cornerback Phillip Buchanon wrote that his mother made a sizable monetary request of him after he was drafted 17th overall by the Oakland Raiders in 2002.<\/p><p>From an excerpt of New Money: Staying Rich that appeared on FOX Sports:<\/p><p>Soon after the draft, she [Buchanon's mother] told me that I owed her a million dollars for raising me for the past 18 years. Well, that was news to me. If my mother taught me anything, it's that this is the most desperate demand that a parent can make on a child. The covenant of having a child is simply that you give your child everything possible, and they owe you nothing beyond a normal amount of love and respect. There is no financial arrangement.<\/p><p>However, Buchanon said he did not pay his mother the $1 million; instead, he bought her a house and covered its maintenance costs. Of this decision, he writes:<\/p><p>\"I bought her a house with my luxury taste and no real wisdom behind it. It was an uneducated purchase.\"<\/p><p>When the cost of this house became too big a burden, Buchanon offered to either buy his mother a smaller house or pay her $15,000. She chose the money.<\/p><p>The 34-year-old went on to say he learned a lesson from reconciling his NFL salary with his familial relationships.<\/p><p>Early on, I found myself in too many situations where some relative would come to me and claim they needed something fixed. So I'd write them a check; of course, the problem never got fixed. The check, however, always got cashed. By trying to fix a problem, I created an additional one for myself \u2026 It took hundreds of thousands of dollars, far more than the cost of an Ivy League education, to learn this lesson.

In the past, many shoppers have even slept outside all night to ensure being among the first to get a new Apple gadget.<\/p><p>The Verizon iPhone's hardware is similar to the existing iPhone -- the big difference being that it works on Verizon's network instead of AT&T, which has had exclusive rights as the iPhone's wireless carrier since 2007.<\/p><p>The new iPhone went on sale at 7 a.m. Thursday at Verizon and Apple stores, at Best Buy and on the retailer's websites. With a two-year contract, it retails for $199 for the 16GB model and $299 for the 32GB model.<\/p><p>Customers were able to pre-order the Verizon iPhone last week, and analysts estimate between 250,000 and 1 million of the phones were sold on pre-order, making it among the biggest phone debuts on the Verizon network.<\/p><p>Pre-orders for the phone sold out within a day, according to Mashable. The phone became available again available for internet purchase Wednesday.<\/p><p>Customers have been calling for Apple to offer the iPhone on networks other than AT&T for years, in part because that network is known for dropped calls.<\/p><p>Consumer Reports surveys consistently rank AT&T below competitors in terms of customer satisfaction. Larger cities, such as New York and San Francisco, have experienced particular problems with dropped calls and a lack of mobile broadband service on AT&T, to a certain degree because so many data-heavy iPhone users contributed to jamming the network.","392":"Mortgage rates are still pretty cheap, even though they've risen a full percentage point since hitting record lows about a year ago.<\/p><p>And with the stronger economy pulling housing along, \"this is a good time to get into the market,\" Anika Khan, Wells Fargo Securities senior economist, told CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" on Friday.<\/p><p>But many first-time homebuyers are being left on the sidelines, watching all that cheap money inch higher because lending requirements remain tight.<\/p><p>The average rate on a 30-year loan ticked up to 4.41 percent from 4.40 percent last week.

Experts called the outcome \"amazing\" and said this quick, cheap test could save tens of thousands of lives each year in developing countries by spotting early signs of cancer, allowing treatment before it's too late.<\/p><p>Usha Devi, one of the women in the study, says it saved her life.<\/p><p>\"Many women refused to get screened. Some of them died of cancer later,\" Devi said. \"Now I feel everyone should get tested. I got my life back because of these tests.\"<\/p><p>Pap smears and tests for HPV, a virus that causes most cervical cancers, have slashed cases and deaths in the United States. But poor countries can't afford those screening tools.<\/p><p>This study tried a test that costs very little and can be done by local people with just two weeks of training and no fancy lab equipment. They swab the cervix with diluted vinegar, which can make abnormal cells briefly change color.<\/p><p>This low-tech visual exam cut the cervical cancer death rate by 31 percent, the study found. It could prevent 22,000 deaths in India and 72,600 worldwide each year, researchers estimate.<\/p><p>\"That's amazing. That's remarkable. It's a very exciting result,\" said Dr. Ted Trimble of the National Cancer Institute in the U.S., the main sponsor of the study.<\/p><p>The story of research participant Usha Devi is not an unusual one. Despite having given birth to four children, she had never had a gynecological exam. She had been bleeding heavily for several years, hoping patience and prayers would fix things.<\/p><p>\"Everyone said it would go away, and every time I thought about going to the doctor there was either no money or something else would come up,\" she said, sitting in a tiny room that serves as bedroom, kitchen, bathroom and living room for her entire family.<\/p><p>One day she found a card from health workers trying to convince women to join the study. Devi is in her late 40s and like many poor Indians doesn't know her date of birth. She learned she had advanced cervical cancer. The study paid for surgery to remove her uterus and cervix.<\/p><p>The research effort was led by Dr. Surendra Shastri of Tata Memorial Hospital in Mumbai. India has nearly one-third of the world's cases of cervical cancer \u2014 more than 140,000 each year.<\/p><p>\"It's just not possible to provide Pap smear screening in developing countries. We don't have that kind of money\" or the staff or equipment, so a simpler method had to be found, Shastri said.<\/p><p>Starting in 1998, researchers enrolled 75,360 women to be screened every two years with the vinegar test. Another 76,178 women were chosen for a control, or comparison group that just got cancer education at the start of the study and vouchers for a free Pap test \u2014 if they could get to the hospital to have one. Women in either group found to have cancer were offered free treatment at the hospital.<\/p><p>Still, this quick and free cancer screening was a hard sell in a deeply conservative country where women are subservient and need permission from husbands, fathers or others for even routine decisions. Social workers were sent into the slums to win people over.<\/p><p>\"We went to every single house in the neighborhood assigned to us introducing ourselves and asking them to come to our health talks. They used to come out of curiosity, listen to the talk but when we asked them to get screened they would totally refuse,\" said one social worker, Vaishnavi Bhagat. \"The women were both scared and shy.\"<\/p><p>One woman who did agree to testing jumped up from the table when she was examined with a speculum. \"She started screaming that we had stolen her kidney,\" Bhagat said. Another health worker was beaten by people in the neighborhood when women realized they would have to disrobe to be screened.<\/p><p>\"There was a sense of shame about taking their clothes off. A lot of them had their babies at home and had never been to a doctor,\" said one health worker, Urmila Hadkar. \"Sometimes just the idea of getting tested for cancer scared them. They would start crying even before being tested.\"<\/p><p>But screening worked. The quality of screening by health workers was comparable to that of an expert gynecologist, researchers reported. The study was planned for 16 years, but results at 12 years showed lives were saved with the screening. So independent monitors advised offering it to the women in the comparison group.<\/p><p>An ethics controversy developed during the study. The U.S. Office for Human Research Protections faulted researchers for not adequately informing participants in the comparison group about Pap tests for screening. A letter from the agency in March indicated officials seemed to accept many of the remedies study leaders had implemented.<\/p><p>\"We looked at the ethics very carefully\" and felt them to be sound, and visited the project in India, said Trimble of the National Cancer Institute.<\/p><p>Dr. Sandra Swain, a cancer specialist at Medstar Washington Hospital Center, also defended the research. She is president of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, and the research results were presented at that group's meeting in Chicago on Sunday.<\/p><p>\"There really was no wrongdoing there,\" she said. \"They have no screening anyway,\" so there is no standard of care now.<\/p><p>Officials in India already are making plans to expand the vinegar testing to a wider population.<\/p><p>Many poor countries can't afford mammograms for breast cancer screening either. The India study also has been testing breast exams by health workers as an alternative. Preliminary results suggest breast cancers are being found at an earlier stage, but it's too soon to know if that will save lives because not enough women have died yet to compare the groups, said Trimble of the National Cancer Institute.<\/p><p>More progress against cervical cancer may come from last month's announcement that two companies will drastically lower prices on HPV vaccines for poor countries.

For many channels, but especially for Esquire, which is trying to avoid being dismissed as Lifetime for men, alcohol is the badge of belonging, a liquid demonstration of youthful hipness, New Age machismo, and of being a \"dude\" or a \"bro\" or, as a South African canoe champion says on \"Boundless,\" using the preferred local term, a \"bru\" (which,as it happens, rhymes with brew).<\/p><p>A few women are allowed in the club.

After Charlie Sheen left \"Two and a Half Men,\" on CBS, the creator killed off his hard-drinking character. (That may have been too cold turkey: this season, the writers introduced his daughter, who seems to have inherited some of her father's bad habits.)<\/p><p>The restraint is relative, and not necessarily a sign that a Puritan revival is spreading across networks. The message that drinking and driving don't mix has sunk in, certainly, but mostly, alcohol jokes seem old hat, and writers prefer the once taboo subjects of marijuana and masturbation.<\/p><p>The Esquire Network has to compete with more established cable brands like Bravo and Discovery. Esquire magazine, of course, has a well-established identity, but even it is often defined by what it's not: Playboy without the centerfolds, The New Yorker without the writers.<\/p><p>Most of Esquire's television fare offers tamer escapism than hit series like \"The Deadliest Catch.\" And it is far less gonzo than almost anything on Vice, a magazine with a YouTube offshoot that is sometimes carried by HBO and offers off-kilter documentaries about places like North Korea.<\/p><p>On Esquire, drinking is the bond that assures viewers that, however fit, disciplined and refined, its heroes are still very much the lads. (Also, some of the top sponsors include Jose Cuervo and Grey Goose vodka.)<\/p><p>The hosts of \"Boundless,\" two Canadian endurance athletes, Simon Donato and Turbo Trebilcock, go to literally marathon lengths to gin up the gin, even in remote and unboozy locations like Angkor Wat in Cambodia. There, they enter a six-day, 230-kilometer marathon, and even in that unendurably hot and humid climate, amid chanting Buddhist monks, there is drinking. A German competitor guzzles a beer at every aid station, though most of the hard-core consumption is committed by a merry group of Indian runners who like to party.<\/p><p>\"Guess we needed a couple more whiskeys before we started,\" one of them, Manoj, says roguishly after a so-so running time on Day 1.<\/p><p>\"Brew Dogs\" doesn't need to work as hard to press the point. It's a show that follows James Watt and Martin Dickie, two young Scottish craft brewers, as they travel across America, seeking unusual ways to create artisanal beers. (The Proclaimers' song \"I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles)\" isn't their theme song, but it should be.)<\/p><p>Perhaps because there is nothing quite as tedious as a man describing the nuanced notes of hops, the Scots go to macho extremes, including brewing a Colonial-style ale with corn, molasses and elements distilled from a copy of the Declaration of Independence, while atop a float in a Fourth of July parade in Pottstown, Pa. (They also coax a young woman fresh from yoga class to sip their doughnut-flavored beer while doing the downward dog.)<\/p><p>Ilan Hall, a chef and the host of \"Knife Fight,\" describes his series as \"a bare-knuckled boxing show of a cooking competition\" that pits chefs against each other in an \"after-hours war zone.\" (He wears a camouflage flak jacket instead of an apron.)<\/p><p>And sure enough, on this cooking show, eating well is an excuse to drink heavily.<\/p><p>As a rowdy crowd cheers them on, rival chefs drink shots and fiercely whip up delicacies like braised goat ribs with yogurt and pomegranate. In one episode, John Herndon, who got his start as a flair bartender and still likes to set cocktails and dishes on fire, takes on Trevor Rocco. Mr. Rocco prepares by eating breakfast eggs. \"Got to coat your stomach for all the booze we are about to drink,\" he explains.<\/p><p>In November, Esquire plans to introduce more shows, including \"Best Bars in America\" and \"White Collar Brawler,\" in which yuppie-esque lawyers, accountants and bankers are taught to box like real men.<\/p><p>They may have to take a punch.

The more extreme it is, the more likely you are to stand out and get lots of likes and comments.\"<\/p><p>The rise of the selfie as an art form has not gone unnoticed by manufacturers such as Asus, which recently launched a phone dubbed the ZenFone Selfie, that as the name suggests, comes with a powerful camera.<\/p><p>But it too is sensitive to the issue of risk-taking selfies and its marketing of the device in France came with a poster campaign similar to that of the Russian government, pointing out places where taking a selfie would be ill-advised - including in front of trains, in cars and with bears.<\/p><p>Despite the publicity, there doesn't appear to be any let-up in the amount of death-defying selfies being taken, nor people's appetite to look at them.<\/p><p>A video on YouTube, compiling what it describes as the \"25 most dangerous selfies ever\", has been viewed over 20 million times.<\/p><p>It includes examples of a man taking a selfie while a bull charges at him, a man posing with a lion, someone taking a picture in front of a train and a woman taking a selfie of herself and her toddler while driving.<\/p><p>James Kingston's picture of himself hanging off a crane (above) came in at number three.<\/p><p>The list also features several self-portraits with sharks which had gone viral but which the video exposes as fakes.<\/p><p>Selfies may have become more dangerous than shark attacks but it seems that even the most intrepid self-shooter draws the line at a picture with a Great White.","446":"Updated Jul 7, 2012 6:40 PM ET<\/p><p>Juventus are reportedly leading the chase to land Robin van Persie, should the Dutchman leave Arsenal this summer.<\/p><p>Which big name stars could be on the move this summer?
