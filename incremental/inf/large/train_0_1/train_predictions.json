The total TV audience for CBA games in the past season increased to 600 million viewers, from 350 million a year earlier. Guangsha's franchise, however, remains a tiny part of the group's overall worth.<\/p><p>Lou says there's no exaggerating the influence of Yao Ming on the development of the sports business in China. \"People skipped work to watch Yao's Houston Rockets when they made the second round of the playoffs this year even though Yao was hurt and didn't play. In the past the public stayed up like that only for the World Cup,\" he explains.<\/p><p>The way Lou sees it, Yao has succeeded because he's a classic example of Chinese-overseas cooperation: If he didn't have success and a lot of fans at home in the first place, he couldn't have gone overseas. And if he hadn't made it in the NBA, he couldn't have become popular worldwide. \"China today is too short of these kind of superstars,\" Lou says.<\/p><p>The Chinese Basketball Association and sports in general in China need more participation by entrepreneurs like Yao. \"Without full ownership there isn't enough commitment to field good players,\" Lou says. \"For Guangsha, every penny we spend is our own money. Better management will lead to better teams.\"<\/p><p>Lou thinks more Chinese will invest in sports teams abroad, just as two Chinese recently invested in the National Basketball Association's Cleveland Cavaliers. \"We would be very interested in investing in the NBA if an opportunity presented itself,\" he says.<\/p><p>In addition to our list of China's 40 Richest, we've again collaborated with our partners at FORBES CHINA magazine to compile a list of the 400 richest people in China.

It has forced large cuts on councils, but has done nothing to ensure they cut the right things \u2013 extravagant salaries, junkets and pointless bureaucracy \u2013 while protecting the services taxpayers value. Indeed, there is much evidence that the opposite is happening.<\/p><p>It's not just this week's headlines about the cutting of public lavatories in Manchester and regeneration programmes in Liverpool: the problem is universal. In south Gloucestershire, Miss Vincent could have set Mumsnet on the council over the \u00a3185,590 salary of its chief executive, Amanda Deeks, or its new \u00a331 million office in Yate. But it was Cameron's jugular she went for.<\/p><p>In many people's minds, these are already the \"Coalition cuts\", so there is probably no need for councils to wage a propaganda war. But the London borough of Newham has launched one none the less. Besides spitting vitriol in its in-house magazine (\u00a3547,000 a year to produce), the borough's \u00a381,000-a-year elected mayor (who rules in tandem with a \u00a3241,000-a-year chief executive) has made a video moaning about the unfairness and holding forth about the council's great achievements \u2013 omitting, for some reason, to mention the \u00a3111 million spent on its vastly luxurious new waterside HQ.<\/p><p>It is the same all over Britain: old people and disabled children are getting it in the neck while council flunkeys carry on living the high life. Renfrewshire is closing community halls, but spent \u00a315,000 hiring an X Factor singer to switch on its Christmas lights. While chopping transport for special-needs children, Cambridgeshire has splurged \u00a3181 million on a guided busway that has yet to carry a passenger, two years after it was due to open. Barnet is thinking of doing away with school-crossing patrols \u2013 but last year increased its leader's allowance by 55 per cent.<\/p><p>In other words, in preaching localism, the Government has made a similar miscalculation to Mrs Thatcher's over the poll tax. It was supposed to increase local accountability: if residents received high bills, they would vote their councils out of office. Instead, the populace took it out on the Government.<\/p><p>Earlier, Mrs Thatcher had taken a different approach, intervening directly over council overspending by capping the rates. She positioned herself, in effect, as the defender of the people against town hall extravagance. Mr Cameron needs to do something similar: rather than talk about localism, he needs to lay down the law and stop front-line services being cut. It turns out that even the \u00a3800 million he pledged for carers of disabled children is not ring-fenced: it could end up kitting out a councillor's office with plasma screens, and the Government couldn't do a thing.<\/p><p>So rather than moaning about councils' behaviour, why not a slip a clause into the Localism Bill that gives the Government powers to cap salaries at the same level as a Cabinet minister (currently \u00a3134,565)? It would hardly be a vote-loser, even if it doesn't fit in with the theme of devolving power. Town hall chiefs may be earning more than Mr Cameron, but that is no reason to fall at their feet. On the contrary: their inflated salaries show where the worst waste and extravagance really lie.<\/p><p>This is an edited version of a piece that appears in the current issue of 'The Spectator'","56":"updated 8:10 AM EDT, Tue July 29, 2014<\/p><p>Mike \"The Situation\" Sorrentino got into a fight inside a tanning salon he co-owns with his brother.<\/p><p>(CNN) -- Former \"Jersey Shore\" star Mike \"The Situation\" Sorrentino will get anger management counseling to settle an assault charge connected to a tanning salon fight with a brother, his lawyer said.<\/p><p>Sorrentino, 31, reached a plea deal with the Middletown, New Jersey, prosecutor allowing him to face a reduced municipal code charge if he completes 12 weeks of private counseling, attorney Edward Fradkin said.<\/p><p>The reality show star appeared in court Monday, when the judge approved the deal, Fradkin said.

The Mexican celebrity magazine TVnotas recently published 25 paparazzi photos of the Rev. Alberto Cuti\u00e9, the popular Miami Beach priest famous for his Spanish-language television and radio talk shows, cavorting amorously on a Florida beach with an attractive woman. Over a three-day period, the pictures also captured him kissing her in a bar. In one of TVnotas's \"in fragranti\" shots [Note to TVnotas copy editors: it's \"in flagrante\"] the woman wraps her legs around Cuti\u00e9; in another, Cuti\u00e9 has a hand down her swimsuit, fondling her rear end.<\/p><p>Because of the scandal, the Archdiocese of Miami says Cuti\u00e9, 40, is no longer the administrator of his Miami Beach parish, and it has barred him from leading Sunday mass there. His media work seems up in the air now, and the popular website padrealberto.net has only a blue screen with a message from Cuti\u00e9 asking forgiveness. (See the 25 most influential evangelicals in America.)<\/p><p>Most Catholics probably don't approve of Cuti\u00c3\u00a9's affair. Still, will they back the archdiocese? Cuti\u00c3\u00a9's punishment is understandable at first glance, at least for his hypocrisy if not for the betrayal of his oath of celibacy. To the Catholic Church, priestly ordination means a marriage vow to the church \u2014 the \"bride of Christ.\" In a statement, Miami Archbishop John Favalora said Cuti\u00c3\u00a9's actions \"cannot be condoned despite the good work he's done as a priest.\" (See pictures of a Catholic congregation fighting to save its church building.)<\/p><p>But Cutie's penalty might elicit more than a few snickers from Catholics who have spent the past few decades watching the priestly perdition parade of sexual abuse, parish embezzlement and doctrinal intolerance. The Miami archdiocese has had to pay out millions of dollars in sexual-abuse settlements in recent years \u2014 including a case involving a former priest at Cuti\u00c3\u00a9's South Beach church, St. Francis de Sales. (One of Cuti\u00c3\u00a9's tasks, in fact, has been to heal the wounds inside that parish.) To his credit, Favalora is trying to restore public trust in his archdiocese and the Church. But so long as Cuti\u00c3\u00a9 wasn't frolicking with a minor (female or male) or using parish funds to buy margaritas for his paramour, many parishioners may actually be relieved that their popular priest has a libido focused on a woman who has reached the age of consent.(Check out a story about the heartthrob of the Vatican.)<\/p><p>What's more, one of the pillars of Cuti\u00c3\u00a9's popularity is his relationship counseling. To any Catholic who's had to suffer through a lecture on marriage from a celibate kid just out of seminary, Cuti\u00c3\u00a9's romantic romp might just make him a more appealing priest \u2014 more human, perhaps, than Catholic clergy who deny communion to divorcees, gays and anyone else who dares violate the Church's litany of \"non-negotiable\" rules. \"He was doing this fairly out in the open,\" notes one Miami Catholic who knows Cuti\u00c3\u00a9 well and has undergone marriage counseling with him. \"Most priests who do this usually try to hide it, but this wasn't some dirty little tryst in the back of the parish residence. It doesn't appear to be just about sex; it's about intimacy, and he's always been able to help people understand which is more important.\"<\/p><p>The attraction of the unidentified woman in the photos to Cuti\u00c3\u00a9 isn't surprising, either. Cuti\u00c3\u00a9's last name is pronounced koo-tee-AY, but that hasn't stopped people from calling the handsome, telegenic priest \"Father Cutie\" \u2014 the kind of hunk-in-a-collar whom smitten Catholic schoolgirls often nickname \"Father What-a-Waste.\" In 1999, when he burst onto the scene just four years after his ordination with his first television talk show on the Spanish-language Telemundo network, Cambia Tu Vida Con Padre Alberto (Change Your Life With Father Alberto), he remarked to the Miami Herald that celibacy is \"a struggle, but it's a good struggle.\"<\/p><p>It was a battle that Cuti\u00c3\u00a9 was perhaps destined to lose, not just because of his good looks but his celebrity. In the chaste, pre-Vatican II culture of the 1950s, no one would have dared wonder if a priestly TV phenom like Bishop Fulton Sheen had a girlfriend. But today, the temptations for an attractive media star, ordained or not, are greater \u2014 especially in the narcissistic Gomorrah of South Beach. And Cuti\u00c3\u00a9 was never a shy altar boy to begin with. Born in Puerto Rico to Cuban parents, he was a popular deejay as a teen, and he still likes disco music and getting buff in the gym.<\/p><p>That's not to say, however, that Cuti\u00e9 is a liberal priest. His current television talk show, Hablando Con Padre Alberto (Talking With Father Alberto), is aired on the conservative Catholic network EWTN (Eternal World Television Network) founded by the engaging but dogmatically stern nun, Mother Angelica. Last December he blasted Playboy's Mexican edition for what he called a \"blasphemous\" cover photo that depicted a model as the Virgin Mary. On his shows on the Radio Paz (Radio Peace) network, and in his columns and books, such as Ama de Verdad, Vive de Verdad (Real Love, Real Life), Cuti\u00e9 usually toes the Vatican's doctrinal line on issues like abortion.<\/p><p>Nonetheless, the Cuti\u00c3\u00a9 scandal is sure to ratchet up debate over clerical celibacy in the Catholic Church, a spiritual ideal that seems to collide more often today with biological reality. (See the recent paternity-suit travails of Paraguayan President Fernando Lugo, who has admitted to fathering a child, and is alleged to have sired others, while he was still a priest.) A bigger problem for the Church, however, may be Cuti\u00c3\u00a9's Oprah-like standing in the Latino community \u2014 the only demographic where U.S. Catholicism is experiencing growth. America's Catholic bishops, many of whom are widely accused of allowing the sexual abuse crisis to happen, must realize that Cuti\u00c3\u00a9 is more well regarded among Catholics than they are, especially among Latinos, meaning the hierarchy will probably need to handle the tele-priest's future with special care.<\/p><p>For his part, Cuti\u00e9 said in his statement that \"the commitment I made to serve God will remain intact,\" a vague message that left many of his parishioners wondering if he plans to stay in the priesthood. Regardless, Cuti\u00e9's Miami Catholic friend notes that the priest, and the Church, need to recognize \"that there's another human being involved in this, the woman in the pictures, and if they're not sensitive to her as well they're looking at double the scandal.\"<\/p><p>In his statement, Favalora said, \"Scandals such as this offer an occasion for the Church on all levels to examine our consciences regarding the integrity of our commitments.\" He's right; but scandals like this also prompt Catholics to more closely and critically examine the battered integrity of their Church. And while they may not applaud Cuti\u00e9 for tasting forbidden fruit, they may not condemn him as harshly as the Church thinks they should either.","59":"Los Angeles-based lawyer Patricia Glaser appeared on Fox News's \"Hannity\" last night to advance Rush Limbaugh's case against the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee over the radio host's comments about sexual consent in a Sept. 15 broadcast. \"You can't maliciously attack people, their freedom of speech,\" Glaser told Sean Hannity. \"And you certainly can't put words \u2014 and it's irresponsible to put words in the mouth of someone that were never uttered.\"<\/p><p>With that attack, Glaser summed up a Nov. 6 threat letter that she sent to the DCCC on Limbaugh's behalf. At issue in the spat is a Sept. 17 e-mail blast from the DCCC accusing Limbaugh of \"excusing rape on college campuses\" and saying \"'no' means 'yes' if you know how to spot it.\" The way Limbaugh & Co. see things, that's an out-of-context slam on the radio host, who said all of this:<\/p><p>How many of you guys, in your own experience with women, have learned that 'no' means 'yes' if you know how to spot it? I'm probably \u2014 let me tell you something, in this modern world, that is simply, that's not tolerated. People aren't even going to try to understand that one. I mean, it used to be said as a cliche. Used to be part of the advice young boys were given. See, that's what we've got to change. We have got to reprogram the way we raise men. Permission every step of the way, clearly spelling out 'why.' Are these not lawsuits waiting to happen if even one of these steps is not taken?<\/p><p>Responding to a question from Hannity about Limbaugh's status as a public figure for the purposes of media law, Glaser noted, \"What do I have to demonstrate because he's a public figure? I have to show malice. Could it be any clearer what the malice is? I don't even think I need to explain that to people who are watching the show. It is a deliberate effort to mischaracterize,\" she said. As the Erik Wemple Blog pointed out yesterday, the DCCC had plenty of company in its interpretation of Limbaugh's remarks.<\/p><p>Though Glaser knows the legal issues surrounding Limbaugh's claims, she earns no self-awareness points. By saying \"You can't maliciously attack people,\" Glaser invites comparison with Limbaugh's 2012 offensive against Sandra Fluke, then a Georgetown University law student who had given testimony on Capitol Hill on the importance of contraception coverage in insurance plans. Limbaugh proceeded to hammer her for being a \"slut,\" a \"prostitute\" and many other things.<\/p><p>The Washington Post's Gene Weingarten wrote about Limbaugh's fine appreciation of context in the Fluke case:<\/p><p>All of this bile followed from his assertion that she testified about her own extremely active sex life.<\/p><p>Here's the thing: She didn't. She said nothing whatsoever about her own sex life. She did not mention her own contraceptive needs at all: She spoke passionately and eloquently, and respectfully, about several friends of hers, Georgetown students who she said were diagnosed with medical conditions requiring the birth control pill, but who could not get it because they could not afford it. That was it. Here is the transcript of her testimony.<\/p><p>Following a huge uproar, Limbaugh apologized to Fluke for his \"word choices.\"<\/p><p>Limbaugh & Co., said Glaser, wants the DCCC to make amends: \"We want an apology. We want a retraction. And we want it as broadly disseminated as the irresponsible defamation was broadly disseminated,\" she told Hannity.<\/p><p>As for the Fox News host, he sounded excited about a legal proceeding: \"You know what, it's a serious issue, because I think you're right,\" Hannity said. \"And as somebody that works in this business, this happens all the time. And in this case I believe they so crossed the line. It's going to be very interesting to see this work its way through the courts. I think they're going to be surprised.\"<\/p><p>Erik Wemple writes the Erik Wemple blog, where he reports and opines on media organizations of all sorts.","60":"If only it were the worst thing that a Roman Catholic priest has been caught doing.

The Mexican celebrity magazine TVnotas recently published 25 paparazzi photos of the Rev. Alberto Cuti\u00e9, the popular Miami Beach priest famous for his Spanish-language television and radio talk shows, cavorting amorously on a Florida beach with an attractive woman. Over a three-day period, the pictures also captured him kissing her in a bar. In one of TVnotas's \"in fragranti\" shots [Note to TVnotas copy editors: it's \"in flagrante\"] the woman wraps her legs around Cuti\u00e9; in another, Cuti\u00e9 has a hand down her swimsuit, fondling her rear end.<\/p><p>Because of the scandal, the Archdiocese of Miami says Cuti\u00e9, 40, is no longer the administrator of his Miami Beach parish, and it has barred him from leading Sunday mass there. His media work seems up in the air now, and the popular website padrealberto.net has only a blue screen with a message from Cuti\u00e9 asking forgiveness. (See the 25 most influential evangelicals in America.)<\/p><p>Most Catholics probably don't approve of Cuti\u00c3\u00a9's affair. Still, will they back the archdiocese? Cuti\u00c3\u00a9's punishment is understandable at first glance, at least for his hypocrisy if not for the betrayal of his oath of celibacy. To the Catholic Church, priestly ordination means a marriage vow to the church \u2014 the \"bride of Christ.\" In a statement, Miami Archbishop John Favalora said Cuti\u00c3\u00a9's actions \"cannot be condoned despite the good work he's done as a priest.\" (See pictures of a Catholic congregation fighting to save its church building.)<\/p><p>But Cutie's penalty might elicit more than a few snickers from Catholics who have spent the past few decades watching the priestly perdition parade of sexual abuse, parish embezzlement and doctrinal intolerance. The Miami archdiocese has had to pay out millions of dollars in sexual-abuse settlements in recent years \u2014 including a case involving a former priest at Cuti\u00c3\u00a9's South Beach church, St. Francis de Sales. (One of Cuti\u00c3\u00a9's tasks, in fact, has been to heal the wounds inside that parish.) To his credit, Favalora is trying to restore public trust in his archdiocese and the Church. But so long as Cuti\u00c3\u00a9 wasn't frolicking with a minor (female or male) or using parish funds to buy margaritas for his paramour, many parishioners may actually be relieved that their popular priest has a libido focused on a woman who has reached the age of consent.(Check out a story about the heartthrob of the Vatican.)<\/p><p>What's more, one of the pillars of Cuti\u00c3\u00a9's popularity is his relationship counseling. To any Catholic who's had to suffer through a lecture on marriage from a celibate kid just out of seminary, Cuti\u00c3\u00a9's romantic romp might just make him a more appealing priest \u2014 more human, perhaps, than Catholic clergy who deny communion to divorcees, gays and anyone else who dares violate the Church's litany of \"non-negotiable\" rules. \"He was doing this fairly out in the open,\" notes one Miami Catholic who knows Cuti\u00c3\u00a9 well and has undergone marriage counseling with him. \"Most priests who do this usually try to hide it, but this wasn't some dirty little tryst in the back of the parish residence. It doesn't appear to be just about sex; it's about intimacy, and he's always been able to help people understand which is more important.\"<\/p><p>The attraction of the unidentified woman in the photos to Cuti\u00c3\u00a9 isn't surprising, either. Cuti\u00c3\u00a9's last name is pronounced koo-tee-AY, but that hasn't stopped people from calling the handsome, telegenic priest \"Father Cutie\" \u2014 the kind of hunk-in-a-collar whom smitten Catholic schoolgirls often nickname \"Father What-a-Waste.\" In 1999, when he burst onto the scene just four years after his ordination with his first television talk show on the Spanish-language Telemundo network, Cambia Tu Vida Con Padre Alberto (Change Your Life With Father Alberto), he remarked to the Miami Herald that celibacy is \"a struggle, but it's a good struggle.\"<\/p><p>It was a battle that Cuti\u00c3\u00a9 was perhaps destined to lose, not just because of his good looks but his celebrity. In the chaste, pre-Vatican II culture of the 1950s, no one would have dared wonder if a priestly TV phenom like Bishop Fulton Sheen had a girlfriend. But today, the temptations for an attractive media star, ordained or not, are greater \u2014 especially in the narcissistic Gomorrah of South Beach. And Cuti\u00c3\u00a9 was never a shy altar boy to begin with. Born in Puerto Rico to Cuban parents, he was a popular deejay as a teen, and he still likes disco music and getting buff in the gym.<\/p><p>That's not to say, however, that Cuti\u00e9 is a liberal priest. His current television talk show, Hablando Con Padre Alberto (Talking With Father Alberto), is aired on the conservative Catholic network EWTN (Eternal World Television Network) founded by the engaging but dogmatically stern nun, Mother Angelica. Last December he blasted Playboy's Mexican edition for what he called a \"blasphemous\" cover photo that depicted a model as the Virgin Mary. On his shows on the Radio Paz (Radio Peace) network, and in his columns and books, such as Ama de Verdad, Vive de Verdad (Real Love, Real Life), Cuti\u00e9 usually toes the Vatican's doctrinal line on issues like abortion.<\/p><p>Nonetheless, the Cuti\u00c3\u00a9 scandal is sure to ratchet up debate over clerical celibacy in the Catholic Church, a spiritual ideal that seems to collide more often today with biological reality. (See the recent paternity-suit travails of Paraguayan President Fernando Lugo, who has admitted to fathering a child, and is alleged to have sired others, while he was still a priest.) A bigger problem for the Church, however, may be Cuti\u00c3\u00a9's Oprah-like standing in the Latino community \u2014 the only demographic where U.S. Catholicism is experiencing growth. America's Catholic bishops, many of whom are widely accused of allowing the sexual abuse crisis to happen, must realize that Cuti\u00c3\u00a9 is more well regarded among Catholics than they are, especially among Latinos, meaning the hierarchy will probably need to handle the tele-priest's future with special care.<\/p><p>For his part, Cuti\u00e9 said in his statement that \"the commitment I made to serve God will remain intact,\" a vague message that left many of his parishioners wondering if he plans to stay in the priesthood.

Cuti\u00c3\u00a9's last name is pronounced koo-tee-AY, but that hasn't stopped people from calling the handsome, telegenic priest \"Father Cutie\" \u2014 the kind of hunk-in-a-collar whom smitten Catholic schoolgirls often nickname \"Father What-a-Waste.\" In 1999, when he burst onto the scene just four years after his ordination with his first television talk show on the Spanish-language Telemundo network, Cambia Tu Vida Con Padre Alberto (Change Your Life With Father Alberto), he remarked to the Miami Herald that celibacy is \"a struggle, but it's a good struggle.\"<\/p><p>It was a battle that Cuti\u00c3\u00a9 was perhaps destined to lose, not just because of his good looks but his celebrity. In the chaste, pre-Vatican II culture of the 1950s, no one would have dared wonder if a priestly TV phenom like Bishop Fulton Sheen had a girlfriend. But today, the temptations for an attractive media star, ordained or not, are greater \u2014 especially in the narcissistic Gomorrah of South Beach. And Cuti\u00c3\u00a9 was never a shy altar boy to begin with. Born in Puerto Rico to Cuban parents, he was a popular deejay as a teen, and he still likes disco music and getting buff in the gym.<\/p><p>That's not to say, however, that Cuti\u00e9 is a liberal priest. His current television talk show, Hablando Con Padre Alberto (Talking With Father Alberto), is aired on the conservative Catholic network EWTN (Eternal World Television Network) founded by the engaging but dogmatically stern nun, Mother Angelica. Last December he blasted Playboy's Mexican edition for what he called a \"blasphemous\" cover photo that depicted a model as the Virgin Mary. On his shows on the Radio Paz (Radio Peace) network, and in his columns and books, such as Ama de Verdad, Vive de Verdad (Real Love, Real Life), Cuti\u00e9 usually toes the Vatican's doctrinal line on issues like abortion.<\/p><p>Nonetheless, the Cuti\u00c3\u00a9 scandal is sure to ratchet up debate over clerical celibacy in the Catholic Church, a spiritual ideal that seems to collide more often today with biological reality. (See the recent paternity-suit travails of Paraguayan President Fernando Lugo, who has admitted to fathering a child, and is alleged to have sired others, while he was still a priest.) A bigger problem for the Church, however, may be Cuti\u00c3\u00a9's Oprah-like standing in the Latino community \u2014 the only demographic where U.S. Catholicism is experiencing growth. America's Catholic bishops, many of whom are widely accused of allowing the sexual abuse crisis to happen, must realize that Cuti\u00c3\u00a9 is more well regarded among Catholics than they are, especially among Latinos, meaning the hierarchy will probably need to handle the tele-priest's future with special care.<\/p><p>For his part, Cuti\u00e9 said in his statement that \"the commitment I made to serve God will remain intact,\" a vague message that left many of his parishioners wondering if he plans to stay in the priesthood. Regardless, Cuti\u00e9's Miami Catholic friend notes that the priest, and the Church, need to recognize \"that there's another human being involved in this, the woman in the pictures, and if they're not sensitive to her as well they're looking at double the scandal.\"<\/p><p>In his statement, Favalora said, \"Scandals such as this offer an occasion for the Church on all levels to examine our consciences regarding the integrity of our commitments.\" He's right; but scandals like this also prompt Catholics to more closely and critically examine the battered integrity of their Church. And while they may not applaud Cuti\u00e9 for tasting forbidden fruit, they may not condemn him as harshly as the Church thinks they should either.","83":"Los Angeles-based lawyer Patricia Glaser appeared on Fox News's \"Hannity\" last night to advance Rush Limbaugh's case against the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee over the radio host's comments about sexual consent in a Sept. 15 broadcast. \"You can't maliciously attack people, their freedom of speech,\" Glaser told Sean Hannity. \"And you certainly can't put words \u2014 and it's irresponsible to put words in the mouth of someone that were never uttered.\"<\/p><p>With that attack, Glaser summed up a Nov. 6 threat letter that she sent to the DCCC on Limbaugh's behalf.

The Mexican celebrity magazine TVnotas recently published 25 paparazzi photos of the Rev. Alberto Cuti\u00e9, the popular Miami Beach priest famous for his Spanish-language television and radio talk shows, cavorting amorously on a Florida beach with an attractive woman. Over a three-day period, the pictures also captured him kissing her in a bar. In one of TVnotas's \"in fragranti\" shots [Note to TVnotas copy editors: it's \"in flagrante\"] the woman wraps her legs around Cuti\u00e9; in another, Cuti\u00e9 has a hand down her swimsuit, fondling her rear end.<\/p><p>Because of the scandal, the Archdiocese of Miami says Cuti\u00e9, 40, is no longer the administrator of his Miami Beach parish, and it has barred him from leading Sunday mass there. His media work seems up in the air now, and the popular website padrealberto.net has only a blue screen with a message from Cuti\u00e9 asking forgiveness. (See the 25 most influential evangelicals in America.)<\/p><p>Most Catholics probably don't approve of Cuti\u00c3\u00a9's affair. Still, will they back the archdiocese? Cuti\u00c3\u00a9's punishment is understandable at first glance, at least for his hypocrisy if not for the betrayal of his oath of celibacy. To the Catholic Church, priestly ordination means a marriage vow to the church \u2014 the \"bride of Christ.\" In a statement, Miami Archbishop John Favalora said Cuti\u00c3\u00a9's actions \"cannot be condoned despite the good work he's done as a priest.\" (See pictures of a Catholic congregation fighting to save its church building.)<\/p><p>But Cutie's penalty might elicit more than a few snickers from Catholics who have spent the past few decades watching the priestly perdition parade of sexual abuse, parish embezzlement and doctrinal intolerance. The Miami archdiocese has had to pay out millions of dollars in sexual-abuse settlements in recent years \u2014 including a case involving a former priest at Cuti\u00c3\u00a9's South Beach church, St. Francis de Sales. (One of Cuti\u00c3\u00a9's tasks, in fact, has been to heal the wounds inside that parish.) To his credit, Favalora is trying to restore public trust in his archdiocese and the Church. But so long as Cuti\u00c3\u00a9 wasn't frolicking with a minor (female or male) or using parish funds to buy margaritas for his paramour, many parishioners may actually be relieved that their popular priest has a libido focused on a woman who has reached the age of consent.(Check out a story about the heartthrob of the Vatican.)<\/p><p>What's more, one of the pillars of Cuti\u00c3\u00a9's popularity is his relationship counseling. To any Catholic who's had to suffer through a lecture on marriage from a celibate kid just out of seminary, Cuti\u00c3\u00a9's romantic romp might just make him a more appealing priest \u2014 more human, perhaps, than Catholic clergy who deny communion to divorcees, gays and anyone else who dares violate the Church's litany of \"non-negotiable\" rules. \"He was doing this fairly out in the open,\" notes one Miami Catholic who knows Cuti\u00c3\u00a9 well and has undergone marriage counseling with him. \"Most priests who do this usually try to hide it, but this wasn't some dirty little tryst in the back of the parish residence. It doesn't appear to be just about sex; it's about intimacy, and he's always been able to help people understand which is more important.\"<\/p><p>The attraction of the unidentified woman in the photos to Cuti\u00c3\u00a9 isn't surprising, either. Cuti\u00c3\u00a9's last name is pronounced koo-tee-AY, but that hasn't stopped people from calling the handsome, telegenic priest \"Father Cutie\" \u2014 the kind of hunk-in-a-collar whom smitten Catholic schoolgirls often nickname \"Father What-a-Waste.\" In 1999, when he burst onto the scene just four years after his ordination with his first television talk show on the Spanish-language Telemundo network, Cambia Tu Vida Con Padre Alberto (Change Your Life With Father Alberto), he remarked to the Miami Herald that celibacy is \"a struggle, but it's a good struggle.\"<\/p><p>It was a battle that Cuti\u00c3\u00a9 was perhaps destined to lose, not just because of his good looks but his celebrity. In the chaste, pre-Vatican II culture of the 1950s, no one would have dared wonder if a priestly TV phenom like Bishop Fulton Sheen had a girlfriend. But today, the temptations for an attractive media star, ordained or not, are greater \u2014 especially in the narcissistic Gomorrah of South Beach. And Cuti\u00c3\u00a9 was never a shy altar boy to begin with. Born in Puerto Rico to Cuban parents, he was a popular deejay as a teen, and he still likes disco music and getting buff in the gym.<\/p><p>That's not to say, however, that Cuti\u00e9 is a liberal priest. His current television talk show, Hablando Con Padre Alberto (Talking With Father Alberto), is aired on the conservative Catholic network EWTN (Eternal World Television Network) founded by the engaging but dogmatically stern nun, Mother Angelica. Last December he blasted Playboy's Mexican edition for what he called a \"blasphemous\" cover photo that depicted a model as the Virgin Mary. On his shows on the Radio Paz (Radio Peace) network, and in his columns and books, such as Ama de Verdad, Vive de Verdad (Real Love, Real Life), Cuti\u00e9 usually toes the Vatican's doctrinal line on issues like abortion.<\/p><p>Nonetheless, the Cuti\u00c3\u00a9 scandal is sure to ratchet up debate over clerical celibacy in the Catholic Church, a spiritual ideal that seems to collide more often today with biological reality.

The Mexican celebrity magazine TVnotas recently published 25 paparazzi photos of the Rev. Alberto Cuti\u00e9, the popular Miami Beach priest famous for his Spanish-language television and radio talk shows, cavorting amorously on a Florida beach with an attractive woman. Over a three-day period, the pictures also captured him kissing her in a bar. In one of TVnotas's \"in fragranti\" shots [Note to TVnotas copy editors: it's \"in flagrante\"] the woman wraps her legs around Cuti\u00e9; in another, Cuti\u00e9 has a hand down her swimsuit, fondling her rear end.<\/p><p>Because of the scandal, the Archdiocese of Miami says Cuti\u00e9, 40, is no longer the administrator of his Miami Beach parish, and it has barred him from leading Sunday mass there. His media work seems up in the air now, and the popular website padrealberto.net has only a blue screen with a message from Cuti\u00e9 asking forgiveness. (See the 25 most influential evangelicals in America.)<\/p><p>Most Catholics probably don't approve of Cuti\u00c3\u00a9's affair. Still, will they back the archdiocese? Cuti\u00c3\u00a9's punishment is understandable at first glance, at least for his hypocrisy if not for the betrayal of his oath of celibacy. To the Catholic Church, priestly ordination means a marriage vow to the church \u2014 the \"bride of Christ.\" In a statement, Miami Archbishop John Favalora said Cuti\u00c3\u00a9's actions \"cannot be condoned despite the good work he's done as a priest.\" (See pictures of a Catholic congregation fighting to save its church building.)<\/p><p>But Cutie's penalty might elicit more than a few snickers from Catholics who have spent the past few decades watching the priestly perdition parade of sexual abuse, parish embezzlement and doctrinal intolerance. The Miami archdiocese has had to pay out millions of dollars in sexual-abuse settlements in recent years \u2014 including a case involving a former priest at Cuti\u00c3\u00a9's South Beach church, St. Francis de Sales. (One of Cuti\u00c3\u00a9's tasks, in fact, has been to heal the wounds inside that parish.) To his credit, Favalora is trying to restore public trust in his archdiocese and the Church. But so long as Cuti\u00c3\u00a9 wasn't frolicking with a minor (female or male) or using parish funds to buy margaritas for his paramour, many parishioners may actually be relieved that their popular priest has a libido focused on a woman who has reached the age of consent.(Check out a story about the heartthrob of the Vatican.)<\/p><p>What's more, one of the pillars of Cuti\u00c3\u00a9's popularity is his relationship counseling. To any Catholic who's had to suffer through a lecture on marriage from a celibate kid just out of seminary, Cuti\u00c3\u00a9's romantic romp might just make him a more appealing priest \u2014 more human, perhaps, than Catholic clergy who deny communion to divorcees, gays and anyone else who dares violate the Church's litany of \"non-negotiable\" rules. \"He was doing this fairly out in the open,\" notes one Miami Catholic who knows Cuti\u00c3\u00a9 well and has undergone marriage counseling with him. \"Most priests who do this usually try to hide it, but this wasn't some dirty little tryst in the back of the parish residence. It doesn't appear to be just about sex; it's about intimacy, and he's always been able to help people understand which is more important.\"<\/p><p>The attraction of the unidentified woman in the photos to Cuti\u00c3\u00a9 isn't surprising, either. Cuti\u00c3\u00a9's last name is pronounced koo-tee-AY, but that hasn't stopped people from calling the handsome, telegenic priest \"Father Cutie\" \u2014 the kind of hunk-in-a-collar whom smitten Catholic schoolgirls often nickname \"Father What-a-Waste.\" In 1999, when he burst onto the scene just four years after his ordination with his first television talk show on the Spanish-language Telemundo network, Cambia Tu Vida Con Padre Alberto (Change Your Life With Father Alberto), he remarked to the Miami Herald that celibacy is \"a struggle, but it's a good struggle.\"<\/p><p>It was a battle that Cuti\u00c3\u00a9 was perhaps destined to lose, not just because of his good looks but his celebrity. In the chaste, pre-Vatican II culture of the 1950s, no one would have dared wonder if a priestly TV phenom like Bishop Fulton Sheen had a girlfriend. But today, the temptations for an attractive media star, ordained or not, are greater \u2014 especially in the narcissistic Gomorrah of South Beach. And Cuti\u00c3\u00a9 was never a shy altar boy to begin with. Born in Puerto Rico to Cuban parents, he was a popular deejay as a teen, and he still likes disco music and getting buff in the gym.<\/p><p>That's not to say, however, that Cuti\u00e9 is a liberal priest. His current television talk show, Hablando Con Padre Alberto (Talking With Father Alberto), is aired on the conservative Catholic network EWTN (Eternal World Television Network) founded by the engaging but dogmatically stern nun, Mother Angelica. Last December he blasted Playboy's Mexican edition for what he called a \"blasphemous\" cover photo that depicted a model as the Virgin Mary. On his shows on the Radio Paz (Radio Peace) network, and in his columns and books, such as Ama de Verdad, Vive de Verdad (Real Love, Real Life), Cuti\u00e9 usually toes the Vatican's doctrinal line on issues like abortion.<\/p><p>Nonetheless, the Cuti\u00c3\u00a9 scandal is sure to ratchet up debate over clerical celibacy in the Catholic Church, a spiritual ideal that seems to collide more often today with biological reality. (See the recent paternity-suit travails of Paraguayan President Fernando Lugo, who has admitted to fathering a child, and is alleged to have sired others, while he was still a priest.) A bigger problem for the Church, however, may be Cuti\u00c3\u00a9's Oprah-like standing in the Latino community \u2014 the only demographic where U.S. Catholicism is experiencing growth. America's Catholic bishops, many of whom are widely accused of allowing the sexual abuse crisis to happen, must realize that Cuti\u00c3\u00a9 is more well regarded among Catholics than they are, especially among Latinos, meaning the hierarchy will probably need to handle the tele-priest's future with special care.<\/p><p>For his part, Cuti\u00e9 said in his statement that \"the commitment I made to serve God will remain intact,\" a vague message that left many of his parishioners wondering if he plans to stay in the priesthood. Regardless, Cuti\u00e9's Miami Catholic friend notes that the priest, and the Church, need to recognize \"that there's another human being involved in this, the woman in the pictures, and if they're not sensitive to her as well they're looking at double the scandal.\"<\/p><p>In his statement, Favalora said, \"Scandals such as this offer an occasion for the Church on all levels to examine our consciences regarding the integrity of our commitments.\" He's right; but scandals like this also prompt Catholics to more closely and critically examine the battered integrity of their Church. And while they may not applaud Cuti\u00e9 for tasting forbidden fruit, they may not condemn him as harshly as the Church thinks they should either.","105":"Los Angeles-based lawyer Patricia Glaser appeared on Fox News's \"Hannity\" last night to advance Rush Limbaugh's case against the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee over the radio host's comments about sexual consent in a Sept. 15 broadcast. \"You can't maliciously attack people, their freedom of speech,\" Glaser told Sean Hannity. \"And you certainly can't put words \u2014 and it's irresponsible to put words in the mouth of someone that were never uttered.\"<\/p><p>With that attack, Glaser summed up a Nov. 6 threat letter that she sent to the DCCC on Limbaugh's behalf.

America's Catholic bishops, many of whom are widely accused of allowing the sexual abuse crisis to happen, must realize that Cuti\u00c3\u00a9 is more well regarded among Catholics than they are, especially among Latinos, meaning the hierarchy will probably need to handle the tele-priest's future with special care.<\/p><p>For his part, Cuti\u00e9 said in his statement that \"the commitment I made to serve God will remain intact,\" a vague message that left many of his parishioners wondering if he plans to stay in the priesthood. Regardless, Cuti\u00e9's Miami Catholic friend notes that the priest, and the Church, need to recognize \"that there's another human being involved in this, the woman in the pictures, and if they're not sensitive to her as well they're looking at double the scandal.\"<\/p><p>In his statement, Favalora said, \"Scandals such as this offer an occasion for the Church on all levels to examine our consciences regarding the integrity of our commitments.\" He's right; but scandals like this also prompt Catholics to more closely and critically examine the battered integrity of their Church. And while they may not applaud Cuti\u00e9 for tasting forbidden fruit, they may not condemn him as harshly as the Church thinks they should either.","111":"Los Angeles-based lawyer Patricia Glaser appeared on Fox News's \"Hannity\" last night to advance Rush Limbaugh's case against the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee over the radio host's comments about sexual consent in a Sept. 15 broadcast. \"You can't maliciously attack people, their freedom of speech,\" Glaser told Sean Hannity. \"And you certainly can't put words \u2014 and it's irresponsible to put words in the mouth of someone that were never uttered.\"<\/p><p>With that attack, Glaser summed up a Nov. 6 threat letter that she sent to the DCCC on Limbaugh's behalf. At issue in the spat is a Sept. 17 e-mail blast from the DCCC accusing Limbaugh of \"excusing rape on college campuses\" and saying \"'no' means 'yes' if you know how to spot it.\" The way Limbaugh & Co. see things, that's an out-of-context slam on the radio host, who said all of this:<\/p><p>How many of you guys, in your own experience with women, have learned that 'no' means 'yes' if you know how to spot it? I'm probably \u2014 let me tell you something, in this modern world, that is simply, that's not tolerated. People aren't even going to try to understand that one. I mean, it used to be said as a cliche. Used to be part of the advice young boys were given. See, that's what we've got to change. We have got to reprogram the way we raise men. Permission every step of the way, clearly spelling out 'why.' Are these not lawsuits waiting to happen if even one of these steps is not taken?<\/p><p>Responding to a question from Hannity about Limbaugh's status as a public figure for the purposes of media law, Glaser noted, \"What do I have to demonstrate because he's a public figure? I have to show malice. Could it be any clearer what the malice is? I don't even think I need to explain that to people who are watching the show. It is a deliberate effort to mischaracterize,\" she said. As the Erik Wemple Blog pointed out yesterday, the DCCC had plenty of company in its interpretation of Limbaugh's remarks.<\/p><p>Though Glaser knows the legal issues surrounding Limbaugh's claims, she earns no self-awareness points. By saying \"You can't maliciously attack people,\" Glaser invites comparison with Limbaugh's 2012 offensive against Sandra Fluke, then a Georgetown University law student who had given testimony on Capitol Hill on the importance of contraception coverage in insurance plans. Limbaugh proceeded to hammer her for being a \"slut,\" a \"prostitute\" and many other things.<\/p><p>The Washington Post's Gene Weingarten wrote about Limbaugh's fine appreciation of context in the Fluke case:<\/p><p>All of this bile followed from his assertion that she testified about her own extremely active sex life.<\/p><p>Here's the thing: She didn't. She said nothing whatsoever about her own sex life. She did not mention her own contraceptive needs at all: She spoke passionately and eloquently, and respectfully, about several friends of hers, Georgetown students who she said were diagnosed with medical conditions requiring the birth control pill, but who could not get it because they could not afford it. That was it. Here is the transcript of her testimony.<\/p><p>Following a huge uproar, Limbaugh apologized to Fluke for his \"word choices.\"<\/p><p>Limbaugh & Co., said Glaser, wants the DCCC to make amends: \"We want an apology. We want a retraction. And we want it as broadly disseminated as the irresponsible defamation was broadly disseminated,\" she told Hannity.<\/p><p>As for the Fox News host, he sounded excited about a legal proceeding: \"You know what, it's a serious issue, because I think you're right,\" Hannity said. \"And as somebody that works in this business, this happens all the time. And in this case I believe they so crossed the line. It's going to be very interesting to see this work its way through the courts. I think they're going to be surprised.\"<\/p><p>Erik Wemple writes the Erik Wemple blog, where he reports and opines on media organizations of all sorts."},"first_summary":{"0":"collection of all usatoday.com coverage of intuitive leaders . , including articles , videos , and quotes .","1":"cutting of public lavatories in manchester and regeneration programmes in liverpool : the borough 's # 81,000-a-year elected mayor ( who rules in tandem with a # 241,000-a-year chief executive ) has made a video moaning the neck while council flunkeys carry on living the","2":"Nevertheless , the incident exposes a horrible problem for the Government .
