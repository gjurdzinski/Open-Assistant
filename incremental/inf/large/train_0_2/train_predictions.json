Scandals bring embarrassment regularly. Last summer a professional soccer player was barred for life after pushing a referee to the ground after a 20-minute melee.<\/p><p>Yet Lou Ming is an optimist. His office is full of awards and photos from sports events. His family owns the Guangsha Lions from Hangzhou of the Chinese Basketball Association (CBA). China's top hoops league, he says, increasingly attracts strong owners such as the NBA's Yao Ming, who bought a Shanghai team in July. Says Lou, \"Professional sports in China have a great future for fans and entrepreneurs.\"<\/p><p>China's sports landscape has changed greatly since Lou, 36, first became interested. He started playing basketball when he was a soldier with time to kill and recalls limited chances to watch sports. By contrast, he says, young and old alike these days can tune into sports 24-7 in China on cable TV and on the Internet. These viewers see unprecedented gains by Chinese in world sports. China's hosting of the Summer Olympics, its first-place finish in winning gold medals and government support for the development of a sports industry have fueled a raft of commercial investments and marketing breakthroughs.<\/p><p>The Lou family's Guangsha Group, a construction group controlled by his father, Lou Zhongfu, who is worth $650 million and ranks No. 146 on this year's China Rich List, began its support of sports in the 1990s by sponsoring soccer exhibitions. The company's biggest move was into basketball in April 2005, when it hooked up with the CBA.<\/p><p>Lou himself hired the first coach and attends the team's home games. In 2009 the Lions were 28--22 in the CBA, an improvement from its .500 record last year and its miserable .200 in 2006. \"Like our league, we have been making progress over time,\" Lou says. The total TV audience for CBA games in the past season increased to 600 million viewers, from 350 million a year earlier. Guangsha's franchise, however, remains a tiny part of the group's overall worth.<\/p><p>Lou says there's no exaggerating the influence of Yao Ming on the development of the sports business in China. \"People skipped work to watch Yao's Houston Rockets when they made the second round of the playoffs this year even though Yao was hurt and didn't play. In the past the public stayed up like that only for the World Cup,\" he explains.<\/p><p>The way Lou sees it, Yao has succeeded because he's a classic example of Chinese-overseas cooperation: If he didn't have success and a lot of fans at home in the first place, he couldn't have gone overseas. And if he hadn't made it in the NBA, he couldn't have become popular worldwide. \"China today is too short of these kind of superstars,\" Lou says.<\/p><p>The Chinese Basketball Association and sports in general in China need more participation by entrepreneurs like Yao. \"Without full ownership there isn't enough commitment to field good players,\" Lou says. \"For Guangsha, every penny we spend is our own money. Better management will lead to better teams.\"<\/p><p>Lou thinks more Chinese will invest in sports teams abroad, just as two Chinese recently invested in the National Basketball Association's Cleveland Cavaliers. \"We would be very interested in investing in the NBA if an opportunity presented itself,\" he says.<\/p><p>In addition to our list of China's 40 Richest, we've again collaborated with our partners at FORBES CHINA magazine to compile a list of the 400 richest people in China.

It has forced large cuts on councils, but has done nothing to ensure they cut the right things \u2013 extravagant salaries, junkets and pointless bureaucracy \u2013 while protecting the services taxpayers value. Indeed, there is much evidence that the opposite is happening.<\/p><p>It's not just this week's headlines about the cutting of public lavatories in Manchester and regeneration programmes in Liverpool: the problem is universal. In south Gloucestershire, Miss Vincent could have set Mumsnet on the council over the \u00a3185,590 salary of its chief executive, Amanda Deeks, or its new \u00a331 million office in Yate. But it was Cameron's jugular she went for.<\/p><p>In many people's minds, these are already the \"Coalition cuts\", so there is probably no need for councils to wage a propaganda war. But the London borough of Newham has launched one none the less. Besides spitting vitriol in its in-house magazine (\u00a3547,000 a year to produce), the borough's \u00a381,000-a-year elected mayor (who rules in tandem with a \u00a3241,000-a-year chief executive) has made a video moaning about the unfairness and holding forth about the council's great achievements \u2013 omitting, for some reason, to mention the \u00a3111 million spent on its vastly luxurious new waterside HQ.<\/p><p>It is the same all over Britain: old people and disabled children are getting it in the neck while council flunkeys carry on living the high life. Renfrewshire is closing community halls, but spent \u00a315,000 hiring an X Factor singer to switch on its Christmas lights. While chopping transport for special-needs children, Cambridgeshire has splurged \u00a3181 million on a guided busway that has yet to carry a passenger, two years after it was due to open. Barnet is thinking of doing away with school-crossing patrols \u2013 but last year increased its leader's allowance by 55 per cent.<\/p><p>In other words, in preaching localism, the Government has made a similar miscalculation to Mrs Thatcher's over the poll tax. It was supposed to increase local accountability: if residents received high bills, they would vote their councils out of office. Instead, the populace took it out on the Government.<\/p><p>Earlier, Mrs Thatcher had taken a different approach, intervening directly over council overspending by capping the rates. She positioned herself, in effect, as the defender of the people against town hall extravagance. Mr Cameron needs to do something similar: rather than talk about localism, he needs to lay down the law and stop front-line services being cut. It turns out that even the \u00a3800 million he pledged for carers of disabled children is not ring-fenced: it could end up kitting out a councillor's office with plasma screens, and the Government couldn't do a thing.<\/p><p>So rather than moaning about councils' behaviour, why not a slip a clause into the Localism Bill that gives the Government powers to cap salaries at the same level as a Cabinet minister (currently \u00a3134,565)? It would hardly be a vote-loser, even if it doesn't fit in with the theme of devolving power. Town hall chiefs may be earning more than Mr Cameron, but that is no reason to fall at their feet. On the contrary: their inflated salaries show where the worst waste and extravagance really lie.<\/p><p>This is an edited version of a piece that appears in the current issue of 'The Spectator'","56":"updated 8:10 AM EDT, Tue July 29, 2014<\/p><p>Mike \"The Situation\" Sorrentino got into a fight inside a tanning salon he co-owns with his brother.<\/p><p>(CNN) -- Former \"Jersey Shore\" star Mike \"The Situation\" Sorrentino will get anger management counseling to settle an assault charge connected to a tanning salon fight with a brother, his lawyer said.<\/p><p>Sorrentino, 31, reached a plea deal with the Middletown, New Jersey, prosecutor allowing him to face a reduced municipal code charge if he completes 12 weeks of private counseling, attorney Edward Fradkin said.<\/p><p>The reality show star appeared in court Monday, when the judge approved the deal, Fradkin said.

The Mexican celebrity magazine TVnotas recently published 25 paparazzi photos of the Rev. Alberto Cuti\u00e9, the popular Miami Beach priest famous for his Spanish-language television and radio talk shows, cavorting amorously on a Florida beach with an attractive woman. Over a three-day period, the pictures also captured him kissing her in a bar. In one of TVnotas's \"in fragranti\" shots [Note to TVnotas copy editors: it's \"in flagrante\"] the woman wraps her legs around Cuti\u00e9; in another, Cuti\u00e9 has a hand down her swimsuit, fondling her rear end.<\/p><p>Because of the scandal, the Archdiocese of Miami says Cuti\u00e9, 40, is no longer the administrator of his Miami Beach parish, and it has barred him from leading Sunday mass there. His media work seems up in the air now, and the popular website padrealberto.net has only a blue screen with a message from Cuti\u00e9 asking forgiveness. (See the 25 most influential evangelicals in America.)<\/p><p>Most Catholics probably don't approve of Cuti\u00c3\u00a9's affair. Still, will they back the archdiocese? Cuti\u00c3\u00a9's punishment is understandable at first glance, at least for his hypocrisy if not for the betrayal of his oath of celibacy. To the Catholic Church, priestly ordination means a marriage vow to the church \u2014 the \"bride of Christ.\" In a statement, Miami Archbishop John Favalora said Cuti\u00c3\u00a9's actions \"cannot be condoned despite the good work he's done as a priest.\" (See pictures of a Catholic congregation fighting to save its church building.)<\/p><p>But Cutie's penalty might elicit more than a few snickers from Catholics who have spent the past few decades watching the priestly perdition parade of sexual abuse, parish embezzlement and doctrinal intolerance. The Miami archdiocese has had to pay out millions of dollars in sexual-abuse settlements in recent years \u2014 including a case involving a former priest at Cuti\u00c3\u00a9's South Beach church, St. Francis de Sales. (One of Cuti\u00c3\u00a9's tasks, in fact, has been to heal the wounds inside that parish.) To his credit, Favalora is trying to restore public trust in his archdiocese and the Church. But so long as Cuti\u00c3\u00a9 wasn't frolicking with a minor (female or male) or using parish funds to buy margaritas for his paramour, many parishioners may actually be relieved that their popular priest has a libido focused on a woman who has reached the age of consent.(Check out a story about the heartthrob of the Vatican.)<\/p><p>What's more, one of the pillars of Cuti\u00c3\u00a9's popularity is his relationship counseling. To any Catholic who's had to suffer through a lecture on marriage from a celibate kid just out of seminary, Cuti\u00c3\u00a9's romantic romp might just make him a more appealing priest \u2014 more human, perhaps, than Catholic clergy who deny communion to divorcees, gays and anyone else who dares violate the Church's litany of \"non-negotiable\" rules. \"He was doing this fairly out in the open,\" notes one Miami Catholic who knows Cuti\u00c3\u00a9 well and has undergone marriage counseling with him. \"Most priests who do this usually try to hide it, but this wasn't some dirty little tryst in the back of the parish residence. It doesn't appear to be just about sex; it's about intimacy, and he's always been able to help people understand which is more important.\"<\/p><p>The attraction of the unidentified woman in the photos to Cuti\u00c3\u00a9 isn't surprising, either. Cuti\u00c3\u00a9's last name is pronounced koo-tee-AY, but that hasn't stopped people from calling the handsome, telegenic priest \"Father Cutie\" \u2014 the kind of hunk-in-a-collar whom smitten Catholic schoolgirls often nickname \"Father What-a-Waste.\" In 1999, when he burst onto the scene just four years after his ordination with his first television talk show on the Spanish-language Telemundo network, Cambia Tu Vida Con Padre Alberto (Change Your Life With Father Alberto), he remarked to the Miami Herald that celibacy is \"a struggle, but it's a good struggle.\"<\/p><p>It was a battle that Cuti\u00c3\u00a9 was perhaps destined to lose, not just because of his good looks but his celebrity. In the chaste, pre-Vatican II culture of the 1950s, no one would have dared wonder if a priestly TV phenom like Bishop Fulton Sheen had a girlfriend. But today, the temptations for an attractive media star, ordained or not, are greater \u2014 especially in the narcissistic Gomorrah of South Beach. And Cuti\u00c3\u00a9 was never a shy altar boy to begin with. Born in Puerto Rico to Cuban parents, he was a popular deejay as a teen, and he still likes disco music and getting buff in the gym.<\/p><p>That's not to say, however, that Cuti\u00e9 is a liberal priest. His current television talk show, Hablando Con Padre Alberto (Talking With Father Alberto), is aired on the conservative Catholic network EWTN (Eternal World Television Network) founded by the engaging but dogmatically stern nun, Mother Angelica. Last December he blasted Playboy's Mexican edition for what he called a \"blasphemous\" cover photo that depicted a model as the Virgin Mary. On his shows on the Radio Paz (Radio Peace) network, and in his columns and books, such as Ama de Verdad, Vive de Verdad (Real Love, Real Life), Cuti\u00e9 usually toes the Vatican's doctrinal line on issues like abortion.<\/p><p>Nonetheless, the Cuti\u00c3\u00a9 scandal is sure to ratchet up debate over clerical celibacy in the Catholic Church, a spiritual ideal that seems to collide more often today with biological reality. (See the recent paternity-suit travails of Paraguayan President Fernando Lugo, who has admitted to fathering a child, and is alleged to have sired others, while he was still a priest.) A bigger problem for the Church, however, may be Cuti\u00c3\u00a9's Oprah-like standing in the Latino community \u2014 the only demographic where U.S. Catholicism is experiencing growth. America's Catholic bishops, many of whom are widely accused of allowing the sexual abuse crisis to happen, must realize that Cuti\u00c3\u00a9 is more well regarded among Catholics than they are, especially among Latinos, meaning the hierarchy will probably need to handle the tele-priest's future with special care.<\/p><p>For his part, Cuti\u00e9 said in his statement that \"the commitment I made to serve God will remain intact,\" a vague message that left many of his parishioners wondering if he plans to stay in the priesthood. Regardless, Cuti\u00e9's Miami Catholic friend notes that the priest, and the Church, need to recognize \"that there's another human being involved in this, the woman in the pictures, and if they're not sensitive to her as well they're looking at double the scandal.\"<\/p><p>In his statement, Favalora said, \"Scandals such as this offer an occasion for the Church on all levels to examine our consciences regarding the integrity of our commitments.\" He's right; but scandals like this also prompt Catholics to more closely and critically examine the battered integrity of their Church. And while they may not applaud Cuti\u00e9 for tasting forbidden fruit, they may not condemn him as harshly as the Church thinks they should either.","59":"Los Angeles-based lawyer Patricia Glaser appeared on Fox News's \"Hannity\" last night to advance Rush Limbaugh's case against the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee over the radio host's comments about sexual consent in a Sept. 15 broadcast. \"You can't maliciously attack people, their freedom of speech,\" Glaser told Sean Hannity. \"And you certainly can't put words \u2014 and it's irresponsible to put words in the mouth of someone that were never uttered.\"<\/p><p>With that attack, Glaser summed up a Nov. 6 threat letter that she sent to the DCCC on Limbaugh's behalf. At issue in the spat is a Sept. 17 e-mail blast from the DCCC accusing Limbaugh of \"excusing rape on college campuses\" and saying \"'no' means 'yes' if you know how to spot it.\" The way Limbaugh & Co. see things, that's an out-of-context slam on the radio host, who said all of this:<\/p><p>How many of you guys, in your own experience with women, have learned that 'no' means 'yes' if you know how to spot it? I'm probably \u2014 let me tell you something, in this modern world, that is simply, that's not tolerated. People aren't even going to try to understand that one. I mean, it used to be said as a cliche. Used to be part of the advice young boys were given. See, that's what we've got to change. We have got to reprogram the way we raise men. Permission every step of the way, clearly spelling out 'why.' Are these not lawsuits waiting to happen if even one of these steps is not taken?<\/p><p>Responding to a question from Hannity about Limbaugh's status as a public figure for the purposes of media law, Glaser noted, \"What do I have to demonstrate because he's a public figure? I have to show malice. Could it be any clearer what the malice is? I don't even think I need to explain that to people who are watching the show. It is a deliberate effort to mischaracterize,\" she said. As the Erik Wemple Blog pointed out yesterday, the DCCC had plenty of company in its interpretation of Limbaugh's remarks.<\/p><p>Though Glaser knows the legal issues surrounding Limbaugh's claims, she earns no self-awareness points. By saying \"You can't maliciously attack people,\" Glaser invites comparison with Limbaugh's 2012 offensive against Sandra Fluke, then a Georgetown University law student who had given testimony on Capitol Hill on the importance of contraception coverage in insurance plans. Limbaugh proceeded to hammer her for being a \"slut,\" a \"prostitute\" and many other things.<\/p><p>The Washington Post's Gene Weingarten wrote about Limbaugh's fine appreciation of context in the Fluke case:<\/p><p>All of this bile followed from his assertion that she testified about her own extremely active sex life.<\/p><p>Here's the thing: She didn't. She said nothing whatsoever about her own sex life. She did not mention her own contraceptive needs at all: She spoke passionately and eloquently, and respectfully, about several friends of hers, Georgetown students who she said were diagnosed with medical conditions requiring the birth control pill, but who could not get it because they could not afford it. That was it. Here is the transcript of her testimony.<\/p><p>Following a huge uproar, Limbaugh apologized to Fluke for his \"word choices.\"<\/p><p>Limbaugh & Co., said Glaser, wants the DCCC to make amends: \"We want an apology. We want a retraction. And we want it as broadly disseminated as the irresponsible defamation was broadly disseminated,\" she told Hannity.<\/p><p>As for the Fox News host, he sounded excited about a legal proceeding: \"You know what, it's a serious issue, because I think you're right,\" Hannity said. \"And as somebody that works in this business, this happens all the time. And in this case I believe they so crossed the line. It's going to be very interesting to see this work its way through the courts. I think they're going to be surprised.\"<\/p><p>Erik Wemple writes the Erik Wemple blog, where he reports and opines on media organizations of all sorts.","60":"If only it were the worst thing that a Roman Catholic priest has been caught doing.

The Mexican celebrity magazine TVnotas recently published 25 paparazzi photos of the Rev. Alberto Cuti\u00e9, the popular Miami Beach priest famous for his Spanish-language television and radio talk shows, cavorting amorously on a Florida beach with an attractive woman. Over a three-day period, the pictures also captured him kissing her in a bar. In one of TVnotas's \"in fragranti\" shots [Note to TVnotas copy editors: it's \"in flagrante\"] the woman wraps her legs around Cuti\u00e9; in another, Cuti\u00e9 has a hand down her swimsuit, fondling her rear end.<\/p><p>Because of the scandal, the Archdiocese of Miami says Cuti\u00e9, 40, is no longer the administrator of his Miami Beach parish, and it has barred him from leading Sunday mass there. His media work seems up in the air now, and the popular website padrealberto.net has only a blue screen with a message from Cuti\u00e9 asking forgiveness. (See the 25 most influential evangelicals in America.)<\/p><p>Most Catholics probably don't approve of Cuti\u00c3\u00a9's affair. Still, will they back the archdiocese? Cuti\u00c3\u00a9's punishment is understandable at first glance, at least for his hypocrisy if not for the betrayal of his oath of celibacy. To the Catholic Church, priestly ordination means a marriage vow to the church \u2014 the \"bride of Christ.\" In a statement, Miami Archbishop John Favalora said Cuti\u00c3\u00a9's actions \"cannot be condoned despite the good work he's done as a priest.\" (See pictures of a Catholic congregation fighting to save its church building.)<\/p><p>But Cutie's penalty might elicit more than a few snickers from Catholics who have spent the past few decades watching the priestly perdition parade of sexual abuse, parish embezzlement and doctrinal intolerance. The Miami archdiocese has had to pay out millions of dollars in sexual-abuse settlements in recent years \u2014 including a case involving a former priest at Cuti\u00c3\u00a9's South Beach church, St. Francis de Sales. (One of Cuti\u00c3\u00a9's tasks, in fact, has been to heal the wounds inside that parish.) To his credit, Favalora is trying to restore public trust in his archdiocese and the Church. But so long as Cuti\u00c3\u00a9 wasn't frolicking with a minor (female or male) or using parish funds to buy margaritas for his paramour, many parishioners may actually be relieved that their popular priest has a libido focused on a woman who has reached the age of consent.(Check out a story about the heartthrob of the Vatican.)<\/p><p>What's more, one of the pillars of Cuti\u00c3\u00a9's popularity is his relationship counseling. To any Catholic who's had to suffer through a lecture on marriage from a celibate kid just out of seminary, Cuti\u00c3\u00a9's romantic romp might just make him a more appealing priest \u2014 more human, perhaps, than Catholic clergy who deny communion to divorcees, gays and anyone else who dares violate the Church's litany of \"non-negotiable\" rules. \"He was doing this fairly out in the open,\" notes one Miami Catholic who knows Cuti\u00c3\u00a9 well and has undergone marriage counseling with him. \"Most priests who do this usually try to hide it, but this wasn't some dirty little tryst in the back of the parish residence. It doesn't appear to be just about sex; it's about intimacy, and he's always been able to help people understand which is more important.\"<\/p><p>The attraction of the unidentified woman in the photos to Cuti\u00c3\u00a9 isn't surprising, either. Cuti\u00c3\u00a9's last name is pronounced koo-tee-AY, but that hasn't stopped people from calling the handsome, telegenic priest \"Father Cutie\" \u2014 the kind of hunk-in-a-collar whom smitten Catholic schoolgirls often nickname \"Father What-a-Waste.\" In 1999, when he burst onto the scene just four years after his ordination with his first television talk show on the Spanish-language Telemundo network, Cambia Tu Vida Con Padre Alberto (Change Your Life With Father Alberto), he remarked to the Miami Herald that celibacy is \"a struggle, but it's a good struggle.\"<\/p><p>It was a battle that Cuti\u00c3\u00a9 was perhaps destined to lose, not just because of his good looks but his celebrity. In the chaste, pre-Vatican II culture of the 1950s, no one would have dared wonder if a priestly TV phenom like Bishop Fulton Sheen had a girlfriend. But today, the temptations for an attractive media star, ordained or not, are greater \u2014 especially in the narcissistic Gomorrah of South Beach. And Cuti\u00c3\u00a9 was never a shy altar boy to begin with. Born in Puerto Rico to Cuban parents, he was a popular deejay as a teen, and he still likes disco music and getting buff in the gym.<\/p><p>That's not to say, however, that Cuti\u00e9 is a liberal priest. His current television talk show, Hablando Con Padre Alberto (Talking With Father Alberto), is aired on the conservative Catholic network EWTN (Eternal World Television Network) founded by the engaging but dogmatically stern nun, Mother Angelica. Last December he blasted Playboy's Mexican edition for what he called a \"blasphemous\" cover photo that depicted a model as the Virgin Mary. On his shows on the Radio Paz (Radio Peace) network, and in his columns and books, such as Ama de Verdad, Vive de Verdad (Real Love, Real Life), Cuti\u00e9 usually toes the Vatican's doctrinal line on issues like abortion.<\/p><p>Nonetheless, the Cuti\u00c3\u00a9 scandal is sure to ratchet up debate over clerical celibacy in the Catholic Church, a spiritual ideal that seems to collide more often today with biological reality. (See the recent paternity-suit travails of Paraguayan President Fernando Lugo, who has admitted to fathering a child, and is alleged to have sired others, while he was still a priest.)

The Mexican celebrity magazine TVnotas recently published 25 paparazzi photos of the Rev. Alberto Cuti\u00e9, the popular Miami Beach priest famous for his Spanish-language television and radio talk shows, cavorting amorously on a Florida beach with an attractive woman. Over a three-day period, the pictures also captured him kissing her in a bar. In one of TVnotas's \"in fragranti\" shots [Note to TVnotas copy editors: it's \"in flagrante\"] the woman wraps her legs around Cuti\u00e9; in another, Cuti\u00e9 has a hand down her swimsuit, fondling her rear end.<\/p><p>Because of the scandal, the Archdiocese of Miami says Cuti\u00e9, 40, is no longer the administrator of his Miami Beach parish, and it has barred him from leading Sunday mass there. His media work seems up in the air now, and the popular website padrealberto.net has only a blue screen with a message from Cuti\u00e9 asking forgiveness. (See the 25 most influential evangelicals in America.)<\/p><p>Most Catholics probably don't approve of Cuti\u00c3\u00a9's affair. Still, will they back the archdiocese? Cuti\u00c3\u00a9's punishment is understandable at first glance, at least for his hypocrisy if not for the betrayal of his oath of celibacy. To the Catholic Church, priestly ordination means a marriage vow to the church \u2014 the \"bride of Christ.\" In a statement, Miami Archbishop John Favalora said Cuti\u00c3\u00a9's actions \"cannot be condoned despite the good work he's done as a priest.\" (See pictures of a Catholic congregation fighting to save its church building.)<\/p><p>But Cutie's penalty might elicit more than a few snickers from Catholics who have spent the past few decades watching the priestly perdition parade of sexual abuse, parish embezzlement and doctrinal intolerance. The Miami archdiocese has had to pay out millions of dollars in sexual-abuse settlements in recent years \u2014 including a case involving a former priest at Cuti\u00c3\u00a9's South Beach church, St. Francis de Sales. (One of Cuti\u00c3\u00a9's tasks, in fact, has been to heal the wounds inside that parish.) To his credit, Favalora is trying to restore public trust in his archdiocese and the Church. But so long as Cuti\u00c3\u00a9 wasn't frolicking with a minor (female or male) or using parish funds to buy margaritas for his paramour, many parishioners may actually be relieved that their popular priest has a libido focused on a woman who has reached the age of consent.(Check out a story about the heartthrob of the Vatican.)<\/p><p>What's more, one of the pillars of Cuti\u00c3\u00a9's popularity is his relationship counseling. To any Catholic who's had to suffer through a lecture on marriage from a celibate kid just out of seminary, Cuti\u00c3\u00a9's romantic romp might just make him a more appealing priest \u2014 more human, perhaps, than Catholic clergy who deny communion to divorcees, gays and anyone else who dares violate the Church's litany of \"non-negotiable\" rules. \"He was doing this fairly out in the open,\" notes one Miami Catholic who knows Cuti\u00c3\u00a9 well and has undergone marriage counseling with him. \"Most priests who do this usually try to hide it, but this wasn't some dirty little tryst in the back of the parish residence. It doesn't appear to be just about sex; it's about intimacy, and he's always been able to help people understand which is more important.\"<\/p><p>The attraction of the unidentified woman in the photos to Cuti\u00c3\u00a9 isn't surprising, either. Cuti\u00c3\u00a9's last name is pronounced koo-tee-AY, but that hasn't stopped people from calling the handsome, telegenic priest \"Father Cutie\" \u2014 the kind of hunk-in-a-collar whom smitten Catholic schoolgirls often nickname \"Father What-a-Waste.\" In 1999, when he burst onto the scene just four years after his ordination with his first television talk show on the Spanish-language Telemundo network, Cambia Tu Vida Con Padre Alberto (Change Your Life With Father Alberto), he remarked to the Miami Herald that celibacy is \"a struggle, but it's a good struggle.\"<\/p><p>It was a battle that Cuti\u00c3\u00a9 was perhaps destined to lose, not just because of his good looks but his celebrity. In the chaste, pre-Vatican II culture of the 1950s, no one would have dared wonder if a priestly TV phenom like Bishop Fulton Sheen had a girlfriend. But today, the temptations for an attractive media star, ordained or not, are greater \u2014 especially in the narcissistic Gomorrah of South Beach. And Cuti\u00c3\u00a9 was never a shy altar boy to begin with. Born in Puerto Rico to Cuban parents, he was a popular deejay as a teen, and he still likes disco music and getting buff in the gym.<\/p><p>That's not to say, however, that Cuti\u00e9 is a liberal priest. His current television talk show, Hablando Con Padre Alberto (Talking With Father Alberto), is aired on the conservative Catholic network EWTN (Eternal World Television Network) founded by the engaging but dogmatically stern nun, Mother Angelica. Last December he blasted Playboy's Mexican edition for what he called a \"blasphemous\" cover photo that depicted a model as the Virgin Mary. On his shows on the Radio Paz (Radio Peace) network, and in his columns and books, such as Ama de Verdad, Vive de Verdad (Real Love, Real Life), Cuti\u00e9 usually toes the Vatican's doctrinal line on issues like abortion.<\/p><p>Nonetheless, the Cuti\u00c3\u00a9 scandal is sure to ratchet up debate over clerical celibacy in the Catholic Church, a spiritual ideal that seems to collide more often today with biological reality. (See the recent paternity-suit travails of Paraguayan President Fernando Lugo, who has admitted to fathering a child, and is alleged to have sired others, while he was still a priest.) A bigger problem for the Church, however, may be Cuti\u00c3\u00a9's Oprah-like standing in the Latino community \u2014 the only demographic where U.S. Catholicism is experiencing growth. America's Catholic bishops, many of whom are widely accused of allowing the sexual abuse crisis to happen, must realize that Cuti\u00c3\u00a9 is more well regarded among Catholics than they are, especially among Latinos, meaning the hierarchy will probably need to handle the tele-priest's future with special care.<\/p><p>For his part, Cuti\u00e9 said in his statement that \"the commitment I made to serve God will remain intact,\" a vague message that left many of his parishioners wondering if he plans to stay in the priesthood. Regardless, Cuti\u00e9's Miami Catholic friend notes that the priest, and the Church, need to recognize \"that there's another human being involved in this, the woman in the pictures, and if they're not sensitive to her as well they're looking at double the scandal.\"<\/p><p>In his statement, Favalora said, \"Scandals such as this offer an occasion for the Church on all levels to examine our consciences regarding the integrity of our commitments.\" He's right; but scandals like this also prompt Catholics to more closely and critically examine the battered integrity of their Church. And while they may not applaud Cuti\u00e9 for tasting forbidden fruit, they may not condemn him as harshly as the Church thinks they should either.","83":"Los Angeles-based lawyer Patricia Glaser appeared on Fox News's \"Hannity\" last night to advance Rush Limbaugh's case against the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee over the radio host's comments about sexual consent in a Sept. 15 broadcast. \"You can't maliciously attack people, their freedom of speech,\" Glaser told Sean Hannity. \"And you certainly can't put words \u2014 and it's irresponsible to put words in the mouth of someone that were never uttered.\"<\/p><p>With that attack, Glaser summed up a Nov. 6 threat letter that she sent to the DCCC on Limbaugh's behalf.

America's Catholic bishops, many of whom are widely accused of allowing the sexual abuse crisis to happen, must realize that Cuti\u00c3\u00a9 is more well regarded among Catholics than they are, especially among Latinos, meaning the hierarchy will probably need to handle the tele-priest's future with special care.<\/p><p>For his part, Cuti\u00e9 said in his statement that \"the commitment I made to serve God will remain intact,\" a vague message that left many of his parishioners wondering if he plans to stay in the priesthood. Regardless, Cuti\u00e9's Miami Catholic friend notes that the priest, and the Church, need to recognize \"that there's another human being involved in this, the woman in the pictures, and if they're not sensitive to her as well they're looking at double the scandal.\"<\/p><p>In his statement, Favalora said, \"Scandals such as this offer an occasion for the Church on all levels to examine our consciences regarding the integrity of our commitments.\" He's right; but scandals like this also prompt Catholics to more closely and critically examine the battered integrity of their Church. And while they may not applaud Cuti\u00e9 for tasting forbidden fruit, they may not condemn him as harshly as the Church thinks they should either.","96":"Tuesday, August 25, 2015, 12:41 AM<\/p><p>A Kansas man used his dog to beat back a police officer - swinging the poor pooch like a mediaeval mace.<\/p><p>Video shows the moment Michael Rush, 26, allegedly snapped Sunday night, charging at a Park City police officer and then hurling his pint-sized dog at the cop, KSN reported.<\/p><p>\"He was out of it, screaming his head off,\" a neighbor told KSN.<\/p><p>Cops were called after Rush reportedly was spotted walking his dog through several back yards and kicking fences in the quiet suburb north of Wichita.<\/p><p>When an officer with a flashlight confronted Rush, he went into beast mode.<\/p><p>\"I've seen people try to use a dog and sick it on someone, but never seen someone pick one up and swing it through the air and use it as a weapon,\" Park City Police Chief Phil Bostain said. \"That's a first.\"<\/p><p>The man kept coming at the patient officer even after being pepper sprayed and hit with a stun gun, police said.<\/p><p>Rush was subdued after more officers arrived on the scene.<\/p><p>\"I doubt he knew what he was doing,\" the neighbor said.<\/p><p>The black and white dog, which was placed in a local shelter, appeared unharmed while Rush was booked on several charges.<\/p><p>\"Everyone sees a little dog like this - it's defenseless - it's not here by its own choice,\" Bostain told KSN. \"And it's used as a weapon against somebody.

The Mexican celebrity magazine TVnotas recently published 25 paparazzi photos of the Rev. Alberto Cuti\u00e9, the popular Miami Beach priest famous for his Spanish-language television and radio talk shows, cavorting amorously on a Florida beach with an attractive woman. Over a three-day period, the pictures also captured him kissing her in a bar. In one of TVnotas's \"in fragranti\" shots [Note to TVnotas copy editors: it's \"in flagrante\"] the woman wraps her legs around Cuti\u00e9; in another, Cuti\u00e9 has a hand down her swimsuit, fondling her rear end.<\/p><p>Because of the scandal, the Archdiocese of Miami says Cuti\u00e9, 40, is no longer the administrator of his Miami Beach parish, and it has barred him from leading Sunday mass there. His media work seems up in the air now, and the popular website padrealberto.net has only a blue screen with a message from Cuti\u00e9 asking forgiveness. (See the 25 most influential evangelicals in America.)<\/p><p>Most Catholics probably don't approve of Cuti\u00c3\u00a9's affair. Still, will they back the archdiocese? Cuti\u00c3\u00a9's punishment is understandable at first glance, at least for his hypocrisy if not for the betrayal of his oath of celibacy. To the Catholic Church, priestly ordination means a marriage vow to the church \u2014 the \"bride of Christ.\" In a statement, Miami Archbishop John Favalora said Cuti\u00c3\u00a9's actions \"cannot be condoned despite the good work he's done as a priest.\" (See pictures of a Catholic congregation fighting to save its church building.)<\/p><p>But Cutie's penalty might elicit more than a few snickers from Catholics who have spent the past few decades watching the priestly perdition parade of sexual abuse, parish embezzlement and doctrinal intolerance. The Miami archdiocese has had to pay out millions of dollars in sexual-abuse settlements in recent years \u2014 including a case involving a former priest at Cuti\u00c3\u00a9's South Beach church, St. Francis de Sales. (One of Cuti\u00c3\u00a9's tasks, in fact, has been to heal the wounds inside that parish.) To his credit, Favalora is trying to restore public trust in his archdiocese and the Church. But so long as Cuti\u00c3\u00a9 wasn't frolicking with a minor (female or male) or using parish funds to buy margaritas for his paramour, many parishioners may actually be relieved that their popular priest has a libido focused on a woman who has reached the age of consent.(Check out a story about the heartthrob of the Vatican.)<\/p><p>What's more, one of the pillars of Cuti\u00c3\u00a9's popularity is his relationship counseling. To any Catholic who's had to suffer through a lecture on marriage from a celibate kid just out of seminary, Cuti\u00c3\u00a9's romantic romp might just make him a more appealing priest \u2014 more human, perhaps, than Catholic clergy who deny communion to divorcees, gays and anyone else who dares violate the Church's litany of \"non-negotiable\" rules. \"He was doing this fairly out in the open,\" notes one Miami Catholic who knows Cuti\u00c3\u00a9 well and has undergone marriage counseling with him. \"Most priests who do this usually try to hide it, but this wasn't some dirty little tryst in the back of the parish residence. It doesn't appear to be just about sex; it's about intimacy, and he's always been able to help people understand which is more important.\"<\/p><p>The attraction of the unidentified woman in the photos to Cuti\u00c3\u00a9 isn't surprising, either. Cuti\u00c3\u00a9's last name is pronounced koo-tee-AY, but that hasn't stopped people from calling the handsome, telegenic priest \"Father Cutie\" \u2014 the kind of hunk-in-a-collar whom smitten Catholic schoolgirls often nickname \"Father What-a-Waste.\" In 1999, when he burst onto the scene just four years after his ordination with his first television talk show on the Spanish-language Telemundo network, Cambia Tu Vida Con Padre Alberto (Change Your Life With Father Alberto), he remarked to the Miami Herald that celibacy is \"a struggle, but it's a good struggle.\"<\/p><p>It was a battle that Cuti\u00c3\u00a9 was perhaps destined to lose, not just because of his good looks but his celebrity. In the chaste, pre-Vatican II culture of the 1950s, no one would have dared wonder if a priestly TV phenom like Bishop Fulton Sheen had a girlfriend. But today, the temptations for an attractive media star, ordained or not, are greater \u2014 especially in the narcissistic Gomorrah of South Beach. And Cuti\u00c3\u00a9 was never a shy altar boy to begin with. Born in Puerto Rico to Cuban parents, he was a popular deejay as a teen, and he still likes disco music and getting buff in the gym.<\/p><p>That's not to say, however, that Cuti\u00e9 is a liberal priest. His current television talk show, Hablando Con Padre Alberto (Talking With Father Alberto), is aired on the conservative Catholic network EWTN (Eternal World Television Network) founded by the engaging but dogmatically stern nun, Mother Angelica. Last December he blasted Playboy's Mexican edition for what he called a \"blasphemous\" cover photo that depicted a model as the Virgin Mary. On his shows on the Radio Paz (Radio Peace) network, and in his columns and books, such as Ama de Verdad, Vive de Verdad (Real Love, Real Life), Cuti\u00e9 usually toes the Vatican's doctrinal line on issues like abortion.<\/p><p>Nonetheless, the Cuti\u00c3\u00a9 scandal is sure to ratchet up debate over clerical celibacy in the Catholic Church, a spiritual ideal that seems to collide more often today with biological reality.

A bigger problem for the Church, however, may be Cuti\u00c3\u00a9's Oprah-like standing in the Latino community \u2014 the only demographic where U.S. Catholicism is experiencing growth. America's Catholic bishops, many of whom are widely accused of allowing the sexual abuse crisis to happen, must realize that Cuti\u00c3\u00a9 is more well regarded among Catholics than they are, especially among Latinos, meaning the hierarchy will probably need to handle the tele-priest's future with special care.<\/p><p>For his part, Cuti\u00e9 said in his statement that \"the commitment I made to serve God will remain intact,\" a vague message that left many of his parishioners wondering if he plans to stay in the priesthood.

At issue in the spat is a Sept. 17 e-mail blast from the DCCC accusing Limbaugh of \"excusing rape on college campuses\" and saying \"'no' means 'yes' if you know how to spot it.\" The way Limbaugh & Co. see things, that's an out-of-context slam on the radio host, who said all of this:<\/p><p>How many of you guys, in your own experience with women, have learned that 'no' means 'yes' if you know how to spot it? I'm probably \u2014 let me tell you something, in this modern world, that is simply, that's not tolerated. People aren't even going to try to understand that one. I mean, it used to be said as a cliche. Used to be part of the advice young boys were given. See, that's what we've got to change. We have got to reprogram the way we raise men. Permission every step of the way, clearly spelling out 'why.' Are these not lawsuits waiting to happen if even one of these steps is not taken?<\/p><p>Responding to a question from Hannity about Limbaugh's status as a public figure for the purposes of media law, Glaser noted, \"What do I have to demonstrate because he's a public figure? I have to show malice. Could it be any clearer what the malice is? I don't even think I need to explain that to people who are watching the show. It is a deliberate effort to mischaracterize,\" she said. As the Erik Wemple Blog pointed out yesterday, the DCCC had plenty of company in its interpretation of Limbaugh's remarks.<\/p><p>Though Glaser knows the legal issues surrounding Limbaugh's claims, she earns no self-awareness points. By saying \"You can't maliciously attack people,\" Glaser invites comparison with Limbaugh's 2012 offensive against Sandra Fluke, then a Georgetown University law student who had given testimony on Capitol Hill on the importance of contraception coverage in insurance plans. Limbaugh proceeded to hammer her for being a \"slut,\" a \"prostitute\" and many other things.<\/p><p>The Washington Post's Gene Weingarten wrote about Limbaugh's fine appreciation of context in the Fluke case:<\/p><p>All of this bile followed from his assertion that she testified about her own extremely active sex life.<\/p><p>Here's the thing: She didn't. She said nothing whatsoever about her own sex life. She did not mention her own contraceptive needs at all: She spoke passionately and eloquently, and respectfully, about several friends of hers, Georgetown students who she said were diagnosed with medical conditions requiring the birth control pill, but who could not get it because they could not afford it. That was it. Here is the transcript of her testimony.<\/p><p>Following a huge uproar, Limbaugh apologized to Fluke for his \"word choices.\"<\/p><p>Limbaugh & Co., said Glaser, wants the DCCC to make amends: \"We want an apology. We want a retraction. And we want it as broadly disseminated as the irresponsible defamation was broadly disseminated,\" she told Hannity.<\/p><p>As for the Fox News host, he sounded excited about a legal proceeding: \"You know what, it's a serious issue, because I think you're right,\" Hannity said. \"And as somebody that works in this business, this happens all the time. And in this case I believe they so crossed the line. It's going to be very interesting to see this work its way through the courts. I think they're going to be surprised.\"<\/p><p>Erik Wemple writes the Erik Wemple blog, where he reports and opines on media organizations of all sorts.","106":"Tuesday, August 25, 2015, 12:41 AM<\/p><p>A Kansas man used his dog to beat back a police officer - swinging the poor pooch like a mediaeval mace.<\/p><p>Video shows the moment Michael Rush, 26, allegedly snapped Sunday night, charging at a Park City police officer and then hurling his pint-sized dog at the cop, KSN reported.<\/p><p>\"He was out of it, screaming his head off,\" a neighbor told KSN.<\/p><p>Cops were called after Rush reportedly was spotted walking his dog through several back yards and kicking fences in the quiet suburb north of Wichita.<\/p><p>When an officer with a flashlight confronted Rush, he went into beast mode.<\/p><p>\"I've seen people try to use a dog and sick it on someone, but never seen someone pick one up and swing it through the air and use it as a weapon,\" Park City Police Chief Phil Bostain said. \"That's a first.\"<\/p><p>The man kept coming at the patient officer even after being pepper sprayed and hit with a stun gun, police said.<\/p><p>Rush was subdued after more officers arrived on the scene.<\/p><p>\"I doubt he knew what he was doing,\" the neighbor said.<\/p><p>The black and white dog, which was placed in a local shelter, appeared unharmed while Rush was booked on several charges.<\/p><p>\"Everyone sees a little dog like this - it's defenseless - it's not here by its own choice,\" Bostain told KSN. \"And it's used as a weapon against somebody.

The Miami archdiocese has had to pay out millions of dollars in sexual-abuse settlements in recent years \u2014 including a case involving a former priest at Cuti\u00c3\u00a9's South Beach church, St. Francis de Sales. (One of Cuti\u00c3\u00a9's tasks, in fact, has been to heal the wounds inside that parish.) To his credit, Favalora is trying to restore public trust in his archdiocese and the Church. But so long as Cuti\u00c3\u00a9 wasn't frolicking with a minor (female or male) or using parish funds to buy margaritas for his paramour, many parishioners may actually be relieved that their popular priest has a libido focused on a woman who has reached the age of consent.(Check out a story about the heartthrob of the Vatican.)<\/p><p>What's more, one of the pillars of Cuti\u00c3\u00a9's popularity is his relationship counseling. To any Catholic who's had to suffer through a lecture on marriage from a celibate kid just out of seminary, Cuti\u00c3\u00a9's romantic romp might just make him a more appealing priest \u2014 more human, perhaps, than Catholic clergy who deny communion to divorcees, gays and anyone else who dares violate the Church's litany of \"non-negotiable\" rules. \"He was doing this fairly out in the open,\" notes one Miami Catholic who knows Cuti\u00c3\u00a9 well and has undergone marriage counseling with him. \"Most priests who do this usually try to hide it, but this wasn't some dirty little tryst in the back of the parish residence. It doesn't appear to be just about sex; it's about intimacy, and he's always been able to help people understand which is more important.\"<\/p><p>The attraction of the unidentified woman in the photos to Cuti\u00c3\u00a9 isn't surprising, either. Cuti\u00c3\u00a9's last name is pronounced koo-tee-AY, but that hasn't stopped people from calling the handsome, telegenic priest \"Father Cutie\" \u2014 the kind of hunk-in-a-collar whom smitten Catholic schoolgirls often nickname \"Father What-a-Waste.\" In 1999, when he burst onto the scene just four years after his ordination with his first television talk show on the Spanish-language Telemundo network, Cambia Tu Vida Con Padre Alberto (Change Your Life With Father Alberto), he remarked to the Miami Herald that celibacy is \"a struggle, but it's a good struggle.\"<\/p><p>It was a battle that Cuti\u00c3\u00a9 was perhaps destined to lose, not just because of his good looks but his celebrity. In the chaste, pre-Vatican II culture of the 1950s, no one would have dared wonder if a priestly TV phenom like Bishop Fulton Sheen had a girlfriend. But today, the temptations for an attractive media star, ordained or not, are greater \u2014 especially in the narcissistic Gomorrah of South Beach. And Cuti\u00c3\u00a9 was never a shy altar boy to begin with. Born in Puerto Rico to Cuban parents, he was a popular deejay as a teen, and he still likes disco music and getting buff in the gym.<\/p><p>That's not to say, however, that Cuti\u00e9 is a liberal priest. His current television talk show, Hablando Con Padre Alberto (Talking With Father Alberto), is aired on the conservative Catholic network EWTN (Eternal World Television Network) founded by the engaging but dogmatically stern nun, Mother Angelica. Last December he blasted Playboy's Mexican edition for what he called a \"blasphemous\" cover photo that depicted a model as the Virgin Mary. On his shows on the Radio Paz (Radio Peace) network, and in his columns and books, such as Ama de Verdad, Vive de Verdad (Real Love, Real Life), Cuti\u00e9 usually toes the Vatican's doctrinal line on issues like abortion.<\/p><p>Nonetheless, the Cuti\u00c3\u00a9 scandal is sure to ratchet up debate over clerical celibacy in the Catholic Church, a spiritual ideal that seems to collide more often today with biological reality. (See the recent paternity-suit travails of Paraguayan President Fernando Lugo, who has admitted to fathering a child, and is alleged to have sired others, while he was still a priest.) A bigger problem for the Church, however, may be Cuti\u00c3\u00a9's Oprah-like standing in the Latino community \u2014 the only demographic where U.S. Catholicism is experiencing growth. America's Catholic bishops, many of whom are widely accused of allowing the sexual abuse crisis to happen, must realize that Cuti\u00c3\u00a9 is more well regarded among Catholics than they are, especially among Latinos, meaning the hierarchy will probably need to handle the tele-priest's future with special care.<\/p><p>For his part, Cuti\u00e9 said in his statement that \"the commitment I made to serve God will remain intact,\" a vague message that left many of his parishioners wondering if he plans to stay in the priesthood. Regardless, Cuti\u00e9's Miami Catholic friend notes that the priest, and the Church, need to recognize \"that there's another human being involved in this, the woman in the pictures, and if they're not sensitive to her as well they're looking at double the scandal.\"<\/p><p>In his statement, Favalora said, \"Scandals such as this offer an occasion for the Church on all levels to examine our consciences regarding the integrity of our commitments.\" He's right; but scandals like this also prompt Catholics to more closely and critically examine the battered integrity of their Church. And while they may not applaud Cuti\u00e9 for tasting forbidden fruit, they may not condemn him as harshly as the Church thinks they should either.","111":"Los Angeles-based lawyer Patricia Glaser appeared on Fox News's \"Hannity\" last night to advance Rush Limbaugh's case against the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee over the radio host's comments about sexual consent in a Sept. 15 broadcast. \"You can't maliciously attack people, their freedom of speech,\" Glaser told Sean Hannity. \"And you certainly can't put words \u2014 and it's irresponsible to put words in the mouth of someone that were never uttered.\"<\/p><p>With that attack, Glaser summed up a Nov. 6 threat letter that she sent to the DCCC on Limbaugh's behalf. At issue in the spat is a Sept. 17 e-mail blast from the DCCC accusing Limbaugh of \"excusing rape on college campuses\" and saying \"'no' means 'yes' if you know how to spot it.\" The way Limbaugh & Co. see things, that's an out-of-context slam on the radio host, who said all of this:<\/p><p>How many of you guys, in your own experience with women, have learned that 'no' means 'yes' if you know how to spot it? I'm probably \u2014 let me tell you something, in this modern world, that is simply, that's not tolerated. People aren't even going to try to understand that one. I mean, it used to be said as a cliche. Used to be part of the advice young boys were given. See, that's what we've got to change. We have got to reprogram the way we raise men. Permission every step of the way, clearly spelling out 'why.' Are these not lawsuits waiting to happen if even one of these steps is not taken?<\/p><p>Responding to a question from Hannity about Limbaugh's status as a public figure for the purposes of media law, Glaser noted, \"What do I have to demonstrate because he's a public figure? I have to show malice. Could it be any clearer what the malice is? I don't even think I need to explain that to people who are watching the show. It is a deliberate effort to mischaracterize,\" she said. As the Erik Wemple Blog pointed out yesterday, the DCCC had plenty of company in its interpretation of Limbaugh's remarks.<\/p><p>Though Glaser knows the legal issues surrounding Limbaugh's claims, she earns no self-awareness points. By saying \"You can't maliciously attack people,\" Glaser invites comparison with Limbaugh's 2012 offensive against Sandra Fluke, then a Georgetown University law student who had given testimony on Capitol Hill on the importance of contraception coverage in insurance plans. Limbaugh proceeded to hammer her for being a \"slut,\" a \"prostitute\" and many other things.<\/p><p>The Washington Post's Gene Weingarten wrote about Limbaugh's fine appreciation of context in the Fluke case:<\/p><p>All of this bile followed from his assertion that she testified about her own extremely active sex life.<\/p><p>Here's the thing: She didn't. She said nothing whatsoever about her own sex life. She did not mention her own contraceptive needs at all: She spoke passionately and eloquently, and respectfully, about several friends of hers, Georgetown students who she said were diagnosed with medical conditions requiring the birth control pill, but who could not get it because they could not afford it. That was it. Here is the transcript of her testimony.<\/p><p>Following a huge uproar, Limbaugh apologized to Fluke for his \"word choices.\"<\/p><p>Limbaugh & Co., said Glaser, wants the DCCC to make amends: \"We want an apology. We want a retraction. And we want it as broadly disseminated as the irresponsible defamation was broadly disseminated,\" she told Hannity.<\/p><p>As for the Fox News host, he sounded excited about a legal proceeding: \"You know what, it's a serious issue, because I think you're right,\" Hannity said. \"And as somebody that works in this business, this happens all the time. And in this case I believe they so crossed the line. It's going to be very interesting to see this work its way through the courts. I think they're going to be surprised.\"<\/p><p>Erik Wemple writes the Erik Wemple blog, where he reports and opines on media organizations of all sorts.","112":"We need a study to tell us things like this?

He has insisted that he is not interested in running for president a third time. But his friends said a flurry of behind-the-scenes activity is nudging him to more seriously consider it.<\/p><p>Former presidential candidate Mitt Romney is hitting the stump for Republicans this fall -- which reminded us of some of his most memorable moments during the 2012 campaign. Here's a look at some of Romney's worst gaffes and a few predictions he got right. (Julie Percha\/The Washington Post)<\/p><p>Romney has huddled with prominent donors and reconnected with supporters in key states in recent months. Because of the vacuum of power within his party and the lack of a clear 2016 front-runner, confidants said Romney is grappling with this question: If drafted, would he answer the party's call?<\/p><p>Further juicing the speculation was a Des Moines Register-Bloomberg News poll released over the weekend showing that Romney is the only potential 2016 candidate who would beat Hillary Rodham Clinton (D) among likely Iowa voters, 44 percent to 43 percent.<\/p><p>People in Romney's vast political orbit who are waiting and wishing on him to launch another campaign said Romney has done little to quiet them and has been hazy about his plans following next month's midterm elections.<\/p><p>Former Minnesota governor Tim Pawlenty (R), who briefly ran against Romney in 2012 before becoming a close ally, said he wants to see Romney give it another go.<\/p><p>\"There is a feeling that the country missed out on an exceptional president,\" Pawlenty said. \"If he runs, I believe he could win the nomination and the general election. It'd be the right person at the right time, and I would encourage him to do it.\"<\/p><p>Pawlenty noted that Ronald Reagan ran unsuccessfully for president twice before being elected in his third attempt \"and was stronger for it.\" In contrast with Romney, Pawlenty said, \"the emerging class of Republican candidates is untested and unproven.\"<\/p><p>Within Romney's political network, there has been informal chatter about a third run since early 2013, according to people familiar with the discussions. It bubbled up in phone calls and at dinners and has gained steam this year. Requests continue to pour in for him to appear on the campaign trail, and advisers said he is eager to mount a multi-state fly-around swing before Nov. 4.<\/p><p>In Iowa, however, Romney seemed uncomfortable with the 2016 talk. At the West Des Moines rally, he spoke for only five minutes, criticizing President Obama on income inequality, foreign affairs and other issues. When reporters tried to question him afterward, he sneaked into a dark maze of cubicles.<\/p><p>He also said that now that he was no longer a candidate, he had a joke to share involving Obama, golfer Phil Mickelson and tennis great Andre Agassi.<\/p><p>As Romney told it, Obama shows up at a bank to cash a check without his ID. The teller asks him to prove who he is, saying that Mickelson proved his identity by hitting a golf ball into a cup and Agassi proved his by hitting a tennis ball at a target. \"Is there anything you can do to prove who you are?\" the teller asks.<\/p><p>\"I don't have a clue,\" Obama replies in the joke.<\/p><p>The crowd ate it up.<\/p><p>Former aides and senior Republicans say Romney appreciates the GOP masses crowing that he was right about issues such as Russia and health care. But what really intrigues him, they said, are the vulnerabilities among top-tier candidates in the Republican field. If Romney moves toward a race, it would be because he sees a path to victory.<\/p><p>\"It's the market pulling him,\" said Kent Lucken, a longtime friend and adviser who accompanied Romney to Iowa. \"People look at Hillary as the likely Democratic nominee, and the party needs a strong leader who can stand up to her and who's been through the process.\"<\/p><p>Romney is returning to Boston on Tuesday for a dinner that he and his wife, Ann, are hosting for former campaign advisers and business associates. The event \u2014 to benefit neurological research at Brigham and Women's Hospital \u2014 has Romney intimates abuzz.<\/p><p>Save-the-date notices have gone out for the third annual Romney policy retreat in Park City, Utah, in June 2015 \u2014 a signal that he wants a platform to promote his issues as the presidential primary campaign season gets underway.<\/p><p>Romney is also mingling privately with top donors who could fund a third campaign. Romney visited Sept. 23 with Joe Ricketts, a billionaire investor who finances the Ending Spending super PAC, at Ricketts's palatial penthouse apartment covering the entire 78th floor of the Time Warner Center in New York.<\/p><p>On Oct. 6, Romney also took part in a GOP fundraising dinner at the Manhattan apartment of Woody Johnson, the New York Jets owner and former Romney campaign finance chairman. Several 2016 hopefuls gave presentations to the donors, while Romney served as a co-host and made no pitch.<\/p><p>At Johnson's home, Romney and media magnate Rupert Murdoch spoke about Romney's political future. According to two Romney allies familiar with the conversation, Romney was cagey with Murdoch but expressed concerns about the developing GOP field. Romney told Murdoch that he felt uneasy about the party's non-interventionist drift on foreign policy and the base's embrace of ideological hard-liners.<\/p><p>Many Romney boosters believe that his window of opportunity will be in mid- to late 2015, should Sens. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) or Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) ascend and party establishment types turn to Romney as a savior.<\/p><p>If former Florida governor Jeb Bush (R) opts out of a campaign, \"there is going to be more pressure on Mitt to go,\" said Tom Rath, an influential New Hampshire Republican.<\/p><p>At a luncheon this month in Atlanta to help GOP Senate nominee David Perdue, \"people sat up and paid attention\" to Romney, said Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.). \"I pulled him aside afterward to thank him for coming. He said he's not running, and I take him at his word. But I don't think the door is entirely closed, and circumstances can change.\"<\/p><p>That phrase \u2014 \"circumstances can change\" \u2014 has been repeated by many Romney backers since the former nominee used it to describe his own thinking about 2016 in a radio interview last month with Hugh Hewitt.<\/p><p>Spencer Zwick, Romney's former national finance chairman, talks regularly with Romney and said he has been receiving daily calls from donors and other supporters. \"There are still plenty of donors who hope circumstances will change and there will be an opportunity for Romney to run again,\" he said.<\/p><p>Zwick is part of a slimmed-down inner circle, including longtime advisers Beth Myers, Peter Flaherty, Stuart Stevens, Lanhee Chen and aides Kelli Harrison and Matt Waldrip, who are advising Romney on political activities this fall.<\/p><p>Romney traveled through Iowa with three trusted advisers and friends: David Kochel, Ron Kaufman and Lucken. He also reunited with supporters from campaigns past. In Cedar Rapids, Romney spotted Jim Wilson, a Virginia man who logged more than 40,000 miles chasing the GOP nominee from coast to coast in his campaign-festooned GMC pickup. The two hugged. \"You son of a gun,\" Romney said.<\/p><p>Another fan, Gary Chidester, 64, came to the West Des Moines rally with a full coterie of Romney paraphernalia for the former candidate to autograph: campaign placards, enlarged photographs and buttons of Mitt and wife Ann, and paperback and audio copies of Romney's book \"No Apology.\" He also held a framed drawing that a friend gave him of a black cruise ship named Obama sinking into the sea and a white ship named Romney with the caption, \"We're here to save you.\"<\/p><p>\"He's the only qualified person to run this time,\" Chidester said. \"Mitt is a business genius. That's why I've listened to this tape three times. He had it all down \u2014 he had Russia down, he had the debt down \u2014 and all the other Republicans are novices by comparison.\"","116":"A federal judge Friday denied a Native American tribe's request for a temporary restraining order to halt construction on the controversial Dakota Access Pipeline.

My bad; I forgot that society no longer has common sense.<\/p><p>6 years ago my brother was found dead in his apartment. The only explanation the coroner gave my family was that his heart \"just stopped\", and it was most likely due to the fact that he had been drinking what you call \"energy cocktails\" with friends the night before (red bull and vodka).

I found that if I drank all night with the caffine pills I could smoke a one hitter just before going to sleep and I wouldnt have a hangover when I woke up. I could start the process over when I woke up. I did this 5-6 nights a week on average. I graduated with a 3.4 gpa and now I have a great job making 93k per year.

Too much of anything harmful to your body is going to do damage. I for one love the combo but only in moderation. Risky behavior... Give me a break!

My bad; I forgot that society no longer has common sense.<\/p><p>6 years ago my brother was found dead in his apartment. The only explanation the coroner gave my family was that his heart \"just stopped\", and it was most likely due to the fact that he had been drinking what you call \"energy cocktails\" with friends the night before (red bull and vodka).

Why would anyone mix them with alcohol?<\/p><p>When i was in college we would routinly drink all night long taking caffine pills through out to stay up. Its a lot of fun, I had such good times in college, I miss it. We would also inhale aerosol room deoderizers. That just made you kinda pass out and fall down, so not as much fun. I found that if I drank all night with the caffine pills I could smoke a one hitter just before going to sleep and I wouldnt have a hangover when I woke up. I could start the process over when I woke up. I did this 5-6 nights a week on average. I graduated with a 3.4 gpa and now I have a great job making 93k per year.

Too much of anything harmful to your body is going to do damage. I for one love the combo but only in moderation. Risky behavior... Give me a break!

The fact remains, risk increases, not decreases.<\/p><p>It's always interesting to hear from those who justify questionable activity, whether or not it has been definitively determined to be risky. It usually begins with the phrase '...I like..', as if the ends, the effect, justifies the means, the unknown mixture, regardless of the actual risks, usually unknown.<\/p><p>Well, some people like pit bulls, some like shooting AK's at wildlife, some like driving SUV's like sports cars, but, none of those are conducive to low risk, great decisions or desirable behavior.<\/p><p>The operative word here is MAY. This is not a definitive study and, therefore, any conclusions are not empirical.<\/p><p>Two of the worst hangovers I have ever had were the result of just 2 or 3 vodka-redbulls...

But at a closed-door breakfast fundraiser here Monday, the first question from a donor had nothing to do with Ernst's Senate campaign.<\/p><p>\"When you get elected to the Senate, your job should be to convince Mitt Romney to run for president again,\" a donor told Ernst, according to several attendees. The Republican candidate said she would, while Romney laughed.<\/p><p>When Romney and Ernst gathered in a West Des Moines boardroom with about 40 agriculture executives Sunday night, one businessman after another pleaded with Romney to give the White House another shot.<\/p><p>And at a rally for Ernst in Cedar Rapids on Monday, the state legislator who introduced Romney said, \"If his address was 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, I would sleep a lot better.\" After Romney and Ernst finished speaking, some activists chanted, \"Run, Mitt, run!\"<\/p><p>Romney, the 2012 GOP presidential nominee and now the tacit head of the Republican Party, visited Iowa as part of a feverish nationwide tour designed to help the GOP take control of the Senate. He has insisted that he is not interested in running for president a third time. But his friends said a flurry of behind-the-scenes activity is nudging him to more seriously consider it.<\/p><p>Former presidential candidate Mitt Romney is hitting the stump for Republicans this fall -- which reminded us of some of his most memorable moments during the 2012 campaign. Here's a look at some of Romney's worst gaffes and a few predictions he got right. (Julie Percha\/The Washington Post)<\/p><p>Romney has huddled with prominent donors and reconnected with supporters in key states in recent months. Because of the vacuum of power within his party and the lack of a clear 2016 front-runner, confidants said Romney is grappling with this question: If drafted, would he answer the party's call?<\/p><p>Further juicing the speculation was a Des Moines Register-Bloomberg News poll released over the weekend showing that Romney is the only potential 2016 candidate who would beat Hillary Rodham Clinton (D) among likely Iowa voters, 44 percent to 43 percent.<\/p><p>People in Romney's vast political orbit who are waiting and wishing on him to launch another campaign said Romney has done little to quiet them and has been hazy about his plans following next month's midterm elections.<\/p><p>Former Minnesota governor Tim Pawlenty (R), who briefly ran against Romney in 2012 before becoming a close ally, said he wants to see Romney give it another go.<\/p><p>\"There is a feeling that the country missed out on an exceptional president,\" Pawlenty said. \"If he runs, I believe he could win the nomination and the general election. It'd be the right person at the right time, and I would encourage him to do it.\"<\/p><p>Pawlenty noted that Ronald Reagan ran unsuccessfully for president twice before being elected in his third attempt \"and was stronger for it.\" In contrast with Romney, Pawlenty said, \"the emerging class of Republican candidates is untested and unproven.\"<\/p><p>Within Romney's political network, there has been informal chatter about a third run since early 2013, according to people familiar with the discussions. It bubbled up in phone calls and at dinners and has gained steam this year. Requests continue to pour in for him to appear on the campaign trail, and advisers said he is eager to mount a multi-state fly-around swing before Nov. 4.<\/p><p>In Iowa, however, Romney seemed uncomfortable with the 2016 talk. At the West Des Moines rally, he spoke for only five minutes, criticizing President Obama on income inequality, foreign affairs and other issues. When reporters tried to question him afterward, he sneaked into a dark maze of cubicles.<\/p><p>He also said that now that he was no longer a candidate, he had a joke to share involving Obama, golfer Phil Mickelson and tennis great Andre Agassi.<\/p><p>As Romney told it, Obama shows up at a bank to cash a check without his ID. The teller asks him to prove who he is, saying that Mickelson proved his identity by hitting a golf ball into a cup and Agassi proved his by hitting a tennis ball at a target. \"Is there anything you can do to prove who you are?\" the teller asks.<\/p><p>\"I don't have a clue,\" Obama replies in the joke.<\/p><p>The crowd ate it up.<\/p><p>Former aides and senior Republicans say Romney appreciates the GOP masses crowing that he was right about issues such as Russia and health care. But what really intrigues him, they said, are the vulnerabilities among top-tier candidates in the Republican field. If Romney moves toward a race, it would be because he sees a path to victory.<\/p><p>\"It's the market pulling him,\" said Kent Lucken, a longtime friend and adviser who accompanied Romney to Iowa. \"People look at Hillary as the likely Democratic nominee, and the party needs a strong leader who can stand up to her and who's been through the process.\"<\/p><p>Romney is returning to Boston on Tuesday for a dinner that he and his wife, Ann, are hosting for former campaign advisers and business associates. The event \u2014 to benefit neurological research at Brigham and Women's Hospital \u2014 has Romney intimates abuzz.<\/p><p>Save-the-date notices have gone out for the third annual Romney policy retreat in Park City, Utah, in June 2015 \u2014 a signal that he wants a platform to promote his issues as the presidential primary campaign season gets underway.<\/p><p>Romney is also mingling privately with top donors who could fund a third campaign. Romney visited Sept. 23 with Joe Ricketts, a billionaire investor who finances the Ending Spending super PAC, at Ricketts's palatial penthouse apartment covering the entire 78th floor of the Time Warner Center in New York.<\/p><p>On Oct. 6, Romney also took part in a GOP fundraising dinner at the Manhattan apartment of Woody Johnson, the New York Jets owner and former Romney campaign finance chairman. Several 2016 hopefuls gave presentations to the donors, while Romney served as a co-host and made no pitch.<\/p><p>At Johnson's home, Romney and media magnate Rupert Murdoch spoke about Romney's political future. According to two Romney allies familiar with the conversation, Romney was cagey with Murdoch but expressed concerns about the developing GOP field. Romney told Murdoch that he felt uneasy about the party's non-interventionist drift on foreign policy and the base's embrace of ideological hard-liners.<\/p><p>Many Romney boosters believe that his window of opportunity will be in mid- to late 2015, should Sens. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) or Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) ascend and party establishment types turn to Romney as a savior.<\/p><p>If former Florida governor Jeb Bush (R) opts out of a campaign, \"there is going to be more pressure on Mitt to go,\" said Tom Rath, an influential New Hampshire Republican.<\/p><p>At a luncheon this month in Atlanta to help GOP Senate nominee David Perdue, \"people sat up and paid attention\" to Romney, said Sen.

What it does do for me is allow me to keep up with my non-parent friends who can stay up dancing until 5am. Otherwise, I'd pass out at 11pm (toddlers really make you tired, no need to make a study for that). I don't over-do it. Those who do would overdo it and take risks no matter what they were drinking.<\/p><p>@johnna: that's absurd.

I wonder once again how much tax money was spent to tell me what I already knew. Does a Wide-Awake drunk engage in more risky behavior? DUH.... Is there a likelihood of Alcohol poisoning and even death in these situations? again, DUH.... The more things change, the more they remain the same.<\/p><p>What a ridiculous study. It's sad that people even consider this news. There is more caffeine in headache medicine than in a Red Bull. I agree that some of the larger energy drinks, like Monster and Rockstar have quite a bit of caffeine....but mixing it with alcohol isn't the problem. It's the alcohol! People have been mixing liquor with coca cola and coffee forever and this is no different.<\/p><p>Caffeine and alcohol?

I don't think adding a Red Bull or a Monster is going to make that any less true.<\/p><p>I really get annoyed when people leave comments just to say, \"This isn't news!\" People need to be reminded once in a while if something isn't a good idea. A lot of people mix energy drinks with alcohol. As for myself, usually consume my energy drink an hour or so before beginning a night out to shake off a mood, a feeling of sloth.

This study has no control for the initial propensity for risk that the individuals natrually possess. It certainly doesn't make me more inclined to take any risks. What it does do for me is allow me to keep up with my non-parent friends who can stay up dancing until 5am. Otherwise, I'd pass out at 11pm (toddlers really make you tired, no need to make a study for that). I don't over-do it. Those who do would overdo it and take risks no matter what they were drinking.<\/p><p>@johnna: that's absurd.

Anything after 12 can take a turn for the worse!<\/p><p>This is news? 30 years ago, it was caffiene tablets from the back of High Times and power drinking. 20 years ago, it was speed and power drinking. 10 years ago, energy drinks came on the scene and power drinkers have made the transition official. Now we have a study that advises if you give caffiene or other herbal stimulants to a power-drinker, then you get a wide-awake drunk. I wonder once again how much tax money was spent to tell me what I already knew. Does a Wide-Awake drunk engage in more risky behavior? DUH.... Is there a likelihood of Alcohol poisoning and even death in these situations? again, DUH.... The more things change, the more they remain the same.<\/p><p>What a ridiculous study. It's sad that people even consider this news. There is more caffeine in headache medicine than in a Red Bull. I agree that some of the larger energy drinks, like Monster and Rockstar have quite a bit of caffeine....but mixing it with alcohol isn't the problem. It's the alcohol! People have been mixing liquor with coca cola and coffee forever and this is no different.<\/p><p>Caffeine and alcohol? Who would have *ever* thought of mixing those two?<\/p><p>Anyone ever heard of \"Rum & Coke\" before?<\/p><p>And to the people who are equating mixing alcohol and energy drinks to cocaine, wow, you could not be more wrong.

I don't think adding a Red Bull or a Monster is going to make that any less true.<\/p><p>I really get annoyed when people leave comments just to say, \"This isn't news!\" People need to be reminded once in a while if something isn't a good idea. A lot of people mix energy drinks with alcohol. As for myself, usually consume my energy drink an hour or so before beginning a night out to shake off a mood, a feeling of sloth. So maybe my timing is OK? I haven't noticed anything too unusual when I do this. It is wise to remember \"everything in moderation\", as someone above said. It is common sense, but how many of of really practice that?<\/p><p>\"Woolsey says the danger isn't specifically in the caffeine; it's in the combination of drinks with the other stimulants potentially being more dangerous because people haven't built up tolerances to them. Woolsey says many of these so called energy drinks contain unregulated herbal stimulants.\"<\/p><p>Did all of you totally miss this part? You all keep going on about the caffeine.

I found that if I drank all night with the caffine pills I could smoke a one hitter just before going to sleep and I wouldnt have a hangover when I woke up.

It bubbled up in phone calls and at dinners and has gained steam this year. Requests continue to pour in for him to appear on the campaign trail, and advisers said he is eager to mount a multi-state fly-around swing before Nov. 4.<\/p><p>In Iowa, however, Romney seemed uncomfortable with the 2016 talk. At the West Des Moines rally, he spoke for only five minutes, criticizing President Obama on income inequality, foreign affairs and other issues. When reporters tried to question him afterward, he sneaked into a dark maze of cubicles.<\/p><p>He also said that now that he was no longer a candidate, he had a joke to share involving Obama, golfer Phil Mickelson and tennis great Andre Agassi.<\/p><p>As Romney told it, Obama shows up at a bank to cash a check without his ID.

But what really intrigues him, they said, are the vulnerabilities among top-tier candidates in the Republican field. If Romney moves toward a race, it would be because he sees a path to victory.<\/p><p>\"It's the market pulling him,\" said Kent Lucken, a longtime friend and adviser who accompanied Romney to Iowa. \"People look at Hillary as the likely Democratic nominee, and the party needs a strong leader who can stand up to her and who's been through the process.\"<\/p><p>Romney is returning to Boston on Tuesday for a dinner that he and his wife, Ann, are hosting for former campaign advisers and business associates.

According to two Romney allies familiar with the conversation, Romney was cagey with Murdoch but expressed concerns about the developing GOP field. Romney told Murdoch that he felt uneasy about the party's non-interventionist drift on foreign policy and the base's embrace of ideological hard-liners.<\/p><p>Many Romney boosters believe that his window of opportunity will be in mid- to late 2015, should Sens.

Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.). \"I pulled him aside afterward to thank him for coming. He said he's not running, and I take him at his word. But I don't think the door is entirely closed, and circumstances can change.\"<\/p><p>That phrase \u2014 \"circumstances can change\" \u2014 has been repeated by many Romney backers since the former nominee used it to describe his own thinking about 2016 in a radio interview last month with Hugh Hewitt.<\/p><p>Spencer Zwick, Romney's former national finance chairman, talks regularly with Romney and said he has been receiving daily calls from donors and other supporters. \"There are still plenty of donors who hope circumstances will change and there will be an opportunity for Romney to run again,\" he said.<\/p><p>Zwick is part of a slimmed-down inner circle, including longtime advisers Beth Myers, Peter Flaherty, Stuart Stevens, Lanhee Chen and aides Kelli Harrison and Matt Waldrip, who are advising Romney on political activities this fall.<\/p><p>Romney traveled through Iowa with three trusted advisers and friends: David Kochel, Ron Kaufman and Lucken. He also reunited with supporters from campaigns past. In Cedar Rapids, Romney spotted Jim Wilson, a Virginia man who logged more than 40,000 miles chasing the GOP nominee from coast to coast in his campaign-festooned GMC pickup. The two hugged. \"You son of a gun,\" Romney said.<\/p><p>Another fan, Gary Chidester, 64, came to the West Des Moines rally with a full coterie of Romney paraphernalia for the former candidate to autograph: campaign placards, enlarged photographs and buttons of Mitt and wife Ann, and paperback and audio copies of Romney's book \"No Apology.\" He also held a framed drawing that a friend gave him of a black cruise ship named Obama sinking into the sea and a white ship named Romney with the caption, \"We're here to save you.\"<\/p><p>\"He's the only qualified person to run this time,\" Chidester said. \"Mitt is a business genius.

But at a closed-door breakfast fundraiser here Monday, the first question from a donor had nothing to do with Ernst's Senate campaign.<\/p><p>\"When you get elected to the Senate, your job should be to convince Mitt Romney to run for president again,\" a donor told Ernst, according to several attendees. The Republican candidate said she would, while Romney laughed.<\/p><p>When Romney and Ernst gathered in a West Des Moines boardroom with about 40 agriculture executives Sunday night, one businessman after another pleaded with Romney to give the White House another shot.<\/p><p>And at a rally for Ernst in Cedar Rapids on Monday, the state legislator who introduced Romney said, \"If his address was 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, I would sleep a lot better.\" After Romney and Ernst finished speaking, some activists chanted, \"Run, Mitt, run!\"<\/p><p>Romney, the 2012 GOP presidential nominee and now the tacit head of the Republican Party, visited Iowa as part of a feverish nationwide tour designed to help the GOP take control of the Senate. He has insisted that he is not interested in running for president a third time. But his friends said a flurry of behind-the-scenes activity is nudging him to more seriously consider it.<\/p><p>Former presidential candidate Mitt Romney is hitting the stump for Republicans this fall -- which reminded us of some of his most memorable moments during the 2012 campaign. Here's a look at some of Romney's worst gaffes and a few predictions he got right. (Julie Percha\/The Washington Post)<\/p><p>Romney has huddled with prominent donors and reconnected with supporters in key states in recent months. Because of the vacuum of power within his party and the lack of a clear 2016 front-runner, confidants said Romney is grappling with this question: If drafted, would he answer the party's call?<\/p><p>Further juicing the speculation was a Des Moines Register-Bloomberg News poll released over the weekend showing that Romney is the only potential 2016 candidate who would beat Hillary Rodham Clinton (D) among likely Iowa voters, 44 percent to 43 percent.<\/p><p>People in Romney's vast political orbit who are waiting and wishing on him to launch another campaign said Romney has done little to quiet them and has been hazy about his plans following next month's midterm elections.<\/p><p>Former Minnesota governor Tim Pawlenty (R), who briefly ran against Romney in 2012 before becoming a close ally, said he wants to see Romney give it another go.<\/p><p>\"There is a feeling that the country missed out on an exceptional president,\" Pawlenty said. \"If he runs, I believe he could win the nomination and the general election. It'd be the right person at the right time, and I would encourage him to do it.\"<\/p><p>Pawlenty noted that Ronald Reagan ran unsuccessfully for president twice before being elected in his third attempt \"and was stronger for it.\" In contrast with Romney, Pawlenty said, \"the emerging class of Republican candidates is untested and unproven.\"<\/p><p>Within Romney's political network, there has been informal chatter about a third run since early 2013, according to people familiar with the discussions. It bubbled up in phone calls and at dinners and has gained steam this year. Requests continue to pour in for him to appear on the campaign trail, and advisers said he is eager to mount a multi-state fly-around swing before Nov. 4.<\/p><p>In Iowa, however, Romney seemed uncomfortable with the 2016 talk. At the West Des Moines rally, he spoke for only five minutes, criticizing President Obama on income inequality, foreign affairs and other issues. When reporters tried to question him afterward, he sneaked into a dark maze of cubicles.<\/p><p>He also said that now that he was no longer a candidate, he had a joke to share involving Obama, golfer Phil Mickelson and tennis great Andre Agassi.<\/p><p>As Romney told it, Obama shows up at a bank to cash a check without his ID. The teller asks him to prove who he is, saying that Mickelson proved his identity by hitting a golf ball into a cup and Agassi proved his by hitting a tennis ball at a target. \"Is there anything you can do to prove who you are?\" the teller asks.<\/p><p>\"I don't have a clue,\" Obama replies in the joke.<\/p><p>The crowd ate it up.<\/p><p>Former aides and senior Republicans say Romney appreciates the GOP masses crowing that he was right about issues such as Russia and health care. But what really intrigues him, they said, are the vulnerabilities among top-tier candidates in the Republican field. If Romney moves toward a race, it would be because he sees a path to victory.<\/p><p>\"It's the market pulling him,\" said Kent Lucken, a longtime friend and adviser who accompanied Romney to Iowa. \"People look at Hillary as the likely Democratic nominee, and the party needs a strong leader who can stand up to her and who's been through the process.\"<\/p><p>Romney is returning to Boston on Tuesday for a dinner that he and his wife, Ann, are hosting for former campaign advisers and business associates. The event \u2014 to benefit neurological research at Brigham and Women's Hospital \u2014 has Romney intimates abuzz.<\/p><p>Save-the-date notices have gone out for the third annual Romney policy retreat in Park City, Utah, in June 2015 \u2014 a signal that he wants a platform to promote his issues as the presidential primary campaign season gets underway.<\/p><p>Romney is also mingling privately with top donors who could fund a third campaign. Romney visited Sept. 23 with Joe Ricketts, a billionaire investor who finances the Ending Spending super PAC, at Ricketts's palatial penthouse apartment covering the entire 78th floor of the Time Warner Center in New York.<\/p><p>On Oct. 6, Romney also took part in a GOP fundraising dinner at the Manhattan apartment of Woody Johnson, the New York Jets owner and former Romney campaign finance chairman. Several 2016 hopefuls gave presentations to the donors, while Romney served as a co-host and made no pitch.<\/p><p>At Johnson's home, Romney and media magnate Rupert Murdoch spoke about Romney's political future. According to two Romney allies familiar with the conversation, Romney was cagey with Murdoch but expressed concerns about the developing GOP field. Romney told Murdoch that he felt uneasy about the party's non-interventionist drift on foreign policy and the base's embrace of ideological hard-liners.<\/p><p>Many Romney boosters believe that his window of opportunity will be in mid- to late 2015, should Sens. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) or Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) ascend and party establishment types turn to Romney as a savior.<\/p><p>If former Florida governor Jeb Bush (R) opts out of a campaign, \"there is going to be more pressure on Mitt to go,\" said Tom Rath, an influential New Hampshire Republican.<\/p><p>At a luncheon this month in Atlanta to help GOP Senate nominee David Perdue, \"people sat up and paid attention\" to Romney, said Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.). \"I pulled him aside afterward to thank him for coming. He said he's not running, and I take him at his word. But I don't think the door is entirely closed, and circumstances can change.\"<\/p><p>That phrase \u2014 \"circumstances can change\" \u2014 has been repeated by many Romney backers since the former nominee used it to describe his own thinking about 2016 in a radio interview last month with Hugh Hewitt.<\/p><p>Spencer Zwick, Romney's former national finance chairman, talks regularly with Romney and said he has been receiving daily calls from donors and other supporters. \"There are still plenty of donors who hope circumstances will change and there will be an opportunity for Romney to run again,\" he said.<\/p><p>Zwick is part of a slimmed-down inner circle, including longtime advisers Beth Myers, Peter Flaherty, Stuart Stevens, Lanhee Chen and aides Kelli Harrison and Matt Waldrip, who are advising Romney on political activities this fall.<\/p><p>Romney traveled through Iowa with three trusted advisers and friends: David Kochel, Ron Kaufman and Lucken. He also reunited with supporters from campaigns past. In Cedar Rapids, Romney spotted Jim Wilson, a Virginia man who logged more than 40,000 miles chasing the GOP nominee from coast to coast in his campaign-festooned GMC pickup. The two hugged. \"You son of a gun,\" Romney said.<\/p><p>Another fan, Gary Chidester, 64, came to the West Des Moines rally with a full coterie of Romney paraphernalia for the former candidate to autograph: campaign placards, enlarged photographs and buttons of Mitt and wife Ann, and paperback and audio copies of Romney's book \"No Apology.\" He also held a framed drawing that a friend gave him of a black cruise ship named Obama sinking into the sea and a white ship named Romney with the caption, \"We're here to save you.\"<\/p><p>\"He's the only qualified person to run this time,\" Chidester said. \"Mitt is a business genius. That's why I've listened to this tape three times. He had it all down \u2014 he had Russia down, he had the debt down \u2014 and all the other Republicans are novices by comparison.\"","139":"A federal judge Friday denied a Native American tribe's request for a temporary restraining order to halt construction on the controversial Dakota Access Pipeline.

What it does do for me is allow me to keep up with my non-parent friends who can stay up dancing until 5am. Otherwise, I'd pass out at 11pm (toddlers really make you tired, no need to make a study for that). I don't over-do it.

I wonder once again how much tax money was spent to tell me what I already knew. Does a Wide-Awake drunk engage in more risky behavior? DUH.... Is there a likelihood of Alcohol poisoning and even death in these situations? again, DUH.... The more things change, the more they remain the same.<\/p><p>What a ridiculous study. It's sad that people even consider this news. There is more caffeine in headache medicine than in a Red Bull. I agree that some of the larger energy drinks, like Monster and Rockstar have quite a bit of caffeine....but mixing it with alcohol isn't the problem. It's the alcohol!

Who would have *ever* thought of mixing those two?<\/p><p>Anyone ever heard of \"Rum & Coke\" before?<\/p><p>And to the people who are equating mixing alcohol and energy drinks to cocaine, wow, you could not be more wrong.

I don't think adding a Red Bull or a Monster is going to make that any less true.<\/p><p>I really get annoyed when people leave comments just to say, \"This isn't news!\" People need to be reminded once in a while if something isn't a good idea. A lot of people mix energy drinks with alcohol. As for myself, usually consume my energy drink an hour or so before beginning a night out to shake off a mood, a feeling of sloth. So maybe my timing is OK? I haven't noticed anything too unusual when I do this. It is wise to remember \"everything in moderation\", as someone above said. It is common sense, but how many of of really practice that?<\/p><p>\"Woolsey says the danger isn't specifically in the caffeine; it's in the combination of drinks with the other stimulants potentially being more dangerous because people haven't built up tolerances to them.

The only explanation the coroner gave my family was that his heart \"just stopped\", and it was most likely due to the fact that he had been drinking what you call \"energy cocktails\" with friends the night before (red bull and vodka).

Why would anyone mix them with alcohol?<\/p><p>When i was in college we would routinly drink all night long taking caffine pills through out to stay up. Its a lot of fun, I had such good times in college, I miss it. We would also inhale aerosol room deoderizers. That just made you kinda pass out and fall down, so not as much fun. I found that if I drank all night with the caffine pills I could smoke a one hitter just before going to sleep and I wouldnt have a hangover when I woke up. I could start the process over when I woke up. I did this 5-6 nights a week on average. I graduated with a 3.4 gpa and now I have a great job making 93k per year.

But at a closed-door breakfast fundraiser here Monday, the first question from a donor had nothing to do with Ernst's Senate campaign.<\/p><p>\"When you get elected to the Senate, your job should be to convince Mitt Romney to run for president again,\" a donor told Ernst, according to several attendees.

He has insisted that he is not interested in running for president a third time. But his friends said a flurry of behind-the-scenes activity is nudging him to more seriously consider it.<\/p><p>Former presidential candidate Mitt Romney is hitting the stump for Republicans this fall -- which reminded us of some of his most memorable moments during the 2012 campaign. Here's a look at some of Romney's worst gaffes and a few predictions he got right. (Julie Percha\/The Washington Post)<\/p><p>Romney has huddled with prominent donors and reconnected with supporters in key states in recent months. Because of the vacuum of power within his party and the lack of a clear 2016 front-runner, confidants said Romney is grappling with this question: If drafted, would he answer the party's call?<\/p><p>Further juicing the speculation was a Des Moines Register-Bloomberg News poll released over the weekend showing that Romney is the only potential 2016 candidate who would beat Hillary Rodham Clinton (D) among likely Iowa voters, 44 percent to 43 percent.<\/p><p>People in Romney's vast political orbit who are waiting and wishing on him to launch another campaign said Romney has done little to quiet them and has been hazy about his plans following next month's midterm elections.<\/p><p>Former Minnesota governor Tim Pawlenty (R), who briefly ran against Romney in 2012 before becoming a close ally, said he wants to see Romney give it another go.<\/p><p>\"There is a feeling that the country missed out on an exceptional president,\" Pawlenty said. \"If he runs, I believe he could win the nomination and the general election. It'd be the right person at the right time, and I would encourage him to do it.\"<\/p><p>Pawlenty noted that Ronald Reagan ran unsuccessfully for president twice before being elected in his third attempt \"and was stronger for it.\" In contrast with Romney, Pawlenty said, \"the emerging class of Republican candidates is untested and unproven.\"<\/p><p>Within Romney's political network, there has been informal chatter about a third run since early 2013, according to people familiar with the discussions. It bubbled up in phone calls and at dinners and has gained steam this year. Requests continue to pour in for him to appear on the campaign trail, and advisers said he is eager to mount a multi-state fly-around swing before Nov. 4.<\/p><p>In Iowa, however, Romney seemed uncomfortable with the 2016 talk. At the West Des Moines rally, he spoke for only five minutes, criticizing President Obama on income inequality, foreign affairs and other issues. When reporters tried to question him afterward, he sneaked into a dark maze of cubicles.<\/p><p>He also said that now that he was no longer a candidate, he had a joke to share involving Obama, golfer Phil Mickelson and tennis great Andre Agassi.<\/p><p>As Romney told it, Obama shows up at a bank to cash a check without his ID. The teller asks him to prove who he is, saying that Mickelson proved his identity by hitting a golf ball into a cup and Agassi proved his by hitting a tennis ball at a target. \"Is there anything you can do to prove who you are?\" the teller asks.<\/p><p>\"I don't have a clue,\" Obama replies in the joke.<\/p><p>The crowd ate it up.<\/p><p>Former aides and senior Republicans say Romney appreciates the GOP masses crowing that he was right about issues such as Russia and health care. But what really intrigues him, they said, are the vulnerabilities among top-tier candidates in the Republican field. If Romney moves toward a race, it would be because he sees a path to victory.<\/p><p>\"It's the market pulling him,\" said Kent Lucken, a longtime friend and adviser who accompanied Romney to Iowa. \"People look at Hillary as the likely Democratic nominee, and the party needs a strong leader who can stand up to her and who's been through the process.\"<\/p><p>Romney is returning to Boston on Tuesday for a dinner that he and his wife, Ann, are hosting for former campaign advisers and business associates.

Romney visited Sept. 23 with Joe Ricketts, a billionaire investor who finances the Ending Spending super PAC, at Ricketts's palatial penthouse apartment covering the entire 78th floor of the Time Warner Center in New York.<\/p><p>On Oct. 6, Romney also took part in a GOP fundraising dinner at the Manhattan apartment of Woody Johnson, the New York Jets owner and former Romney campaign finance chairman. Several 2016 hopefuls gave presentations to the donors, while Romney served as a co-host and made no pitch.<\/p><p>At Johnson's home, Romney and media magnate Rupert Murdoch spoke about Romney's political future. According to two Romney allies familiar with the conversation, Romney was cagey with Murdoch but expressed concerns about the developing GOP field. Romney told Murdoch that he felt uneasy about the party's non-interventionist drift on foreign policy and the base's embrace of ideological hard-liners.<\/p><p>Many Romney boosters believe that his window of opportunity will be in mid- to late 2015, should Sens. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) or Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) ascend and party establishment types turn to Romney as a savior.<\/p><p>If former Florida governor Jeb Bush (R) opts out of a campaign, \"there is going to be more pressure on Mitt to go,\" said Tom Rath, an influential New Hampshire Republican.<\/p><p>At a luncheon this month in Atlanta to help GOP Senate nominee David Perdue, \"people sat up and paid attention\" to Romney, said Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.). \"I pulled him aside afterward to thank him for coming. He said he's not running, and I take him at his word. But I don't think the door is entirely closed, and circumstances can change.\"<\/p><p>That phrase \u2014 \"circumstances can change\" \u2014 has been repeated by many Romney backers since the former nominee used it to describe his own thinking about 2016 in a radio interview last month with Hugh Hewitt.<\/p><p>Spencer Zwick, Romney's former national finance chairman, talks regularly with Romney and said he has been receiving daily calls from donors and other supporters. \"There are still plenty of donors who hope circumstances will change and there will be an opportunity for Romney to run again,\" he said.<\/p><p>Zwick is part of a slimmed-down inner circle, including longtime advisers Beth Myers, Peter Flaherty, Stuart Stevens, Lanhee Chen and aides Kelli Harrison and Matt Waldrip, who are advising Romney on political activities this fall.<\/p><p>Romney traveled through Iowa with three trusted advisers and friends: David Kochel, Ron Kaufman and Lucken. He also reunited with supporters from campaigns past. In Cedar Rapids, Romney spotted Jim Wilson, a Virginia man who logged more than 40,000 miles chasing the GOP nominee from coast to coast in his campaign-festooned GMC pickup. The two hugged. \"You son of a gun,\" Romney said.<\/p><p>Another fan, Gary Chidester, 64, came to the West Des Moines rally with a full coterie of Romney paraphernalia for the former candidate to autograph: campaign placards, enlarged photographs and buttons of Mitt and wife Ann, and paperback and audio copies of Romney's book \"No Apology.\" He also held a framed drawing that a friend gave him of a black cruise ship named Obama sinking into the sea and a white ship named Romney with the caption, \"We're here to save you.\"<\/p><p>\"He's the only qualified person to run this time,\" Chidester said. \"Mitt is a business genius. That's why I've listened to this tape three times. He had it all down \u2014 he had Russia down, he had the debt down \u2014 and all the other Republicans are novices by comparison.\"","163":"A federal judge Friday denied a Native American tribe's request for a temporary restraining order to halt construction on the controversial Dakota Access Pipeline.

A lot of people mix energy drinks with alcohol. As for myself, usually consume my energy drink an hour or so before beginning a night out to shake off a mood, a feeling of sloth. So maybe my timing is OK? I haven't noticed anything too unusual when I do this. It is wise to remember \"everything in moderation\", as someone above said. It is common sense, but how many of of really practice that?<\/p><p>\"Woolsey says the danger isn't specifically in the caffeine; it's in the combination of drinks with the other stimulants potentially being more dangerous because people haven't built up tolerances to them.
